00:00:03.438 - 00:00:10.542, Speaker B: What's been going on in markets? I saw bitcoin after we did our last episode. It went down a little bit.
00:00:10.678 - 00:00:10.902, Speaker A: But.
00:00:10.918 - 00:00:15.446, Speaker B: It'S mostly right back in the high 37s. It was at 38.

00:00:16.622 - 00:00:20.070, Speaker B: And then equity markets I saw are also performing well. What's going on?
00:00:20.182 - 00:00:58.914, Speaker A: So you've had a continuation of the theme over the past couple of weeks with data deteriorating and dovish Fed speak yesterday really marked a new kind of stage to it when you had a relatively hawkish member of the Fed, Waller, kind of come out more dovish than a lot of market participants were expecting. Basically acknowledging that the fact that a lot of the data has turned and some of the forward looking indicators are suggesting that we're going to head to a softer patch of inflation and employment and things of that nature. Um, you saw twos rally 15 basis points yesterday.
