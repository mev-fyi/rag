00:00:04.480 - 00:00:21.054, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. Hey, this is the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. No intro wrap today because I am traveling. I'm in Miami for the bitcoin conferences. There are actually several. It's a good time. Look out for some content from us on our next week's episode.
00:00:21.054 - 00:01:03.386, Speaker A: I'll have more about what went down at Bitcoin 2023 in that episode. This week, though, we're checking in with Christine Kim from Galaxy Research to talk about Ethereum's finality issue that happened last week. Had a lot of people concerned. She pours some, some water on those fears, I think, in a good way, explains to us what happened. We'll also get an update on the current staking environment on Ethereum from Christine. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro. But before we get into all that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer on the podcast notes and note that none of the information contained in this podcast represents advanced investment advice or an offer, recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:03.386 - 00:01:22.202, Speaker A: Hey, we got the old theme music on. I love the way this track sounds. I've always loved it. I've never figured out how to rap well on this beat, which is why we use it when there is no rap. Phineas is there in the studio keeping me legit here. Let's just get right into the show. Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading.
00:01:22.202 - 00:01:23.842, Speaker A: As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:01:23.898 - 00:01:25.134, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:25.574 - 00:01:32.994, Speaker A: So what is going on in markets? I'm a little bit out of the loop here, man, so just bring us up to speed. It's Wednesday, May 17. Tell us what's going on.
00:01:33.854 - 00:02:10.808, Speaker B: Stocks are ripping. S and P broke through local resistance. Nasdaq is close to trend highs. A lot of the price action today, at least, has been driven by optimism around the debt ceiling. You had McCarthy and Biden both give press conferences where they indicated that they're sort of more optimistic outlooks, and the market took that well. On the rate side of things, you've had a pretty meaningful sell off in rates. That's largely been driven by a lack of pessimism and sort of concerns around the banking system.
00:02:10.808 - 00:03:16.626, Speaker B: Financials was the best performing sector today in the S and P, up almost two and a half percent. It started with one of the distressed regional banks this morning, highlighting that they gained a couple billion in deposits. Obviously, they gained them because they offered competitive rates, but nonetheless, it showed strength and resilience within our banking sector, and that caused price appreciation there. And some of the froth in terms of Fed cuts being taken out of the market, folks are generally now thinking that things are less bad than before, and more broadly, between debt ceiling and a lack of insane financial stability considerations. With banking, that's broadly good for risk assets. I think that's why you're seeing stocks trade well. In addition, you've kind of had a resurgence in the dollar over the past, I wouldn't say week and a half euro dollar basically tested up against 111 or 110 80 and rolled over.
00:03:16.626 - 00:03:56.734, Speaker B: Same thing with cable. Dollar yen has been perking back up again. And so as the concerns around us, growth and financial stability, and as you've gotten that rate cut pricing a little bit more manageable and not as pronounced, that's led to a reasonable bid in the dollar. And that makes sense because a lot of FX is driven by front end interest rate differentials. So, big picture, we've had constructive things for stocks. The dollar and rates have sold off. And then in crypto, it's kind of doing its own thing right now.
00:03:56.734 - 00:04:48.216, Speaker B: But I would say the tether announcement today was insanely meaningful, in my view, the announcement being that they are going to use 15% of operating profits and use that to purchase bitcoin outright. Right now, where things stand, they are the single most profitable business in crypto, making a billion and a half dollars a quarter. To give people some context, I think microstrategy has a market cap around three and a half billion dollars. So literally, in a couple of quarters, like two and a half quarters, tether could buy all of microstrategy. That's the magnitude of money they're making, and it's really efficient. No overhang. And as long as their Aum stays, you know where it's at, they're going to be printing a lot of money.
00:04:48.216 - 00:05:48.700, Speaker B: And God forbid we even put some growth assumptions on their Aum and their interest margins, and then you're really flying. And so I think where it stands right now, the math gets you to around $200 million a quarter of BTC by pressure, which is pretty good. And I think that's a constructive headline that can help bitcoin in the near term. I would say kind of, you know, form a base with stocks trading really well, and us having come off of 30, definitely think that you're kind of close to where I think this last leg of this sell off is going to stop. I think initial support is around 24, 525. You have some other stuff in between there. But with stocks rating this well, with bitcoin taking back 27k today, you know, I think that there's a reasonable chance that, you know, you're kind of bottoming.
00:05:48.700 - 00:05:49.732, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:05:49.748 - 00:05:52.188, Speaker A: This near term sell off may have run out of legs or something.
00:05:52.276 - 00:05:55.284, Speaker B: Yeah, it looks like it's. It's lost a little bit of momentum.
00:05:55.324 - 00:06:09.828, Speaker A: Yeah. The tether announcement is interesting. And, gosh, we have to remind our listeners, like, tether is. It's a great point you made there. They are the biggest business in crypto. Yeah. They've just been printing money hand over.
00:06:09.828 - 00:06:29.230, Speaker A: Not to use it, you know, no pun intended, but handover fist with the rise in interest rates. And they're also. They rolled almost like, whether, you know, coincidentally out of things like commercial paper and heavily into us debt, you know, starting about a year ago. Right. Right. As it happened. So they're.
00:06:29.230 - 00:06:31.754, Speaker A: They're earning a lot of money on those treasuries.
00:06:32.454 - 00:06:39.686, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And, you know, I think it's a great sort of company in the standpoint that they're not even levered.
00:06:39.750 - 00:06:39.974, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:40.014 - 00:07:05.112, Speaker B: Like, they're just. All those profits just go back to equity holders. And it's not like microstrategy that bought bitcoin on debt that they issued. This is like, I'm buying bitcoin with the profits that I'm generating from my business that literally probably only needs five people and a couple of outside counsel law firms to run. The essence of what they're doing is just simple money market stuff.
00:07:05.288 - 00:07:06.564, Speaker A: Yeah. And they have it.
00:07:07.224 - 00:07:35.914, Speaker B: My liabilities cost zero. Cause I pay people zero interest, and I have assets that give me 5% right now. So it's an unbelievable business model. It's incredibly scalable because it's in the most liquid market on the planet, which is the front end treasury market or the front end money market. And so it's highly scalable, highly profitable. And now that business is actively going to be accumulating bitcoin. I think that's a very constructive development.
00:07:37.054 - 00:07:44.902, Speaker A: Yeah. Wild. You know, their circulating supply of tether, it hasn't quite breached its prior all time high, which was from 83 billion.
00:07:44.958 - 00:07:46.222, Speaker B: Now, I mean, what? Like.
00:07:46.278 - 00:08:08.692, Speaker A: Yeah, it was like 83.8. I'm just saying, I've been following, waiting to do the. To do the chart. But yes, it's exactly. It is basically risen throughout. It dropped a ton. I think there was a point last year, Charles Yu on my team wrote a great report about this, how they had redeemed something like $12 billion in eight days during the like big, you know, the initial like drawdowns from Terra and et cetera last year.
00:08:08.692 - 00:08:51.812, Speaker A: But basically since it formed a bottom last June or July, Tether supply has just been marching up and it's, and you've now seen, particularly after the collapse of Silicon Valley bank and circles, you know, issues with briefly not being able to redeem because of that circles supply has been declining while tethers is going up. And it really is this crazy story of. I view it as what happens when we don't have a clear pro America policy agenda for stable coins in the US. You get companies offshore like Tether that can operate fully unconstrained and they're taking advantage of that. Rightly so.
00:08:51.988 - 00:09:11.790, Speaker B: There should be a US based company that's regulated by the US. And it's a no brainer. I mean, stablecoins are incredibly efficient and provide a source of, you know, like us debt buying and like really help, like dollars, you know, don't we need that badly?
00:09:11.822 - 00:09:18.686, Speaker A: Haven't global central banks and sovereigns, it doesn't slowly though. They've been slowly coming off for years. Right.
00:09:18.710 - 00:09:59.312, Speaker B: Like, I'll give you an idea. I mean, like every time, like every day that bills roll off, I think like the average T bill has like $80 billion, maybe like 120 or 160. And so there's like the entire aum. Of, of tether is in like one t bill in the US. And so yes, it would help if tether became like a $500 billion thing, but when you have a huge balance sheet like the fed does, and you're talking about financing a deficit that's $2 trillion and national debt that's 32 trillion, it's a drop in the bucket.
00:09:59.458 - 00:10:03.460, Speaker A: It's a kicker. It's not going to move the needle, but it's nonetheless positive on that side.
00:10:03.572 - 00:10:03.844, Speaker B: Correct?
00:10:03.884 - 00:10:09.064, Speaker A: I guess. Anything else that you're watching in the next week or so?
00:10:10.004 - 00:10:42.252, Speaker B: Yeah, I think high level. The market just got very ahead of itself in terms of cut pricing here in the US. I think the risks are a little bit more two sided. The data that we've seen so far, unit labor costs, employment cost index, the labor wage stuff has been really robust. The services inflation has been pretty robust. You're actually starting to get a reasonable uptick in commodity prices after a fall over the past couple of months. Like oil is back to $72 and some other commodities are starting to rebound a bit.
00:10:42.252 - 00:11:42.000, Speaker B: We've also seen a rebound in rentals the Adobe price index recently that came out highlighted that I think for the month of April, groceries were up like a percent. And so there's still a really tight labor market and there's still inflation. And the 500 basis points of hikes that the Fed is engaged in is barely making a dent. And the US is still 300 basis points away from its inflation target. And the idea, one of the key things about monetary policy is that you need credibility. Not just in the moment, but you need future credibility because let's say like the front end is really high because the US is keeping overnight rates high. If the world starts to imply that the Fed is going to cut in the back end dramatically or in six months from now or nine months from now, that is the exact opposite of what the Fed wants.
00:11:42.000 - 00:12:23.592, Speaker B: That loosens financial conditions for the impact of the interest rate rise. To actually feed through to the economy. You need to have a market that buys into the idea that we could be higher for longer. You're going be in a situation where the Fed is basically forced to communicate that strategy and where they're forced to continually strive to maintain their credibility. Think about this. The market started to price in emergency cuts in July after the Fed hiked most recently. That is to say that the market's like, I get it, Paul.
00:12:23.592 - 00:13:21.964, Speaker B: You just came out on national television and told everybody you're hiking rates even though our banking system looks like it collapses. Think you are so stupid that you will go the other direction in your next meeting? That is what the market tried to do. It shows you the lack of credibility and the huge amount of uncertainty in the market as well. And also just some of, just the liquidity that has broken down in this market just because of how violent some of these recent moves have been. You've got a Fed that is staring at data that's still really strong, that's dealing with a credibility issue and maybe a banking crisis at the same time. Again, not a job that I want anything to do with. And so if monetary policy was just set in advance, like 21 million tokens or something, you wouldn't have to worry about this.
00:13:21.964 - 00:13:24.768, Speaker B: Who knows, maybe I'm being silly.
00:13:24.896 - 00:13:33.976, Speaker A: I love it. Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, my friend, as always, thank you so much. Let's go to our friend Christine Kim from Galaxy Research. Christine, how are you doing?
00:13:34.120 - 00:13:35.992, Speaker C: Doing well. How are you, Alex?
00:13:36.168 - 00:14:01.388, Speaker A: I'm great. And I was really excited to talk to you this week because of this interesting issue that was happening on Ethereum last week that had some people very worried. I think it turned out to mostly be a non event, but you're going to explain it to us. It was this, the Ethereum consensus layer, unable to reach finality for two different hour long periods, I guess what happened first? And then I'm going to ask you what it means.
00:14:01.576 - 00:14:56.044, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think during those two days, because it happened twice on Thursday night, and I think it was Friday, there was a lot of questions, a lot of activity on Twitter. People kind of freaking out, saying that Ethereum broke down, which really was not the case. But yeah, let's break it down. The first thing that I think is useful for understanding what happened is if we understand what finality actually is. So when we say that finality was delayed, we don't mean that people were unable to send transactions on Ethereum. We don't mean that the network was offline for a period when people, when applications weren't running, all of that was still happening. But the checkpoint that the network creates, which is called finality, where all transactions that have been finalized up until that point are considered to be extremely hard to reverse.
00:14:56.044 - 00:15:30.984, Speaker C: So finality, like the term suggests, does. It's basically a point where you can consider all transactions up until that point virtually immutable. And this is really helpful for exchanges and roll ups, because when they're settling very large amounts of value, they want to have confirmation that the transactions won't be reversed. So finale on bitcoin is very probabilistic in that it's up to the exchange how many blocks you want to wait. But on proof of stake, for Ethereum's proof of stake consensus protocol, it's a pretty clear cut. It's a very clear cut process.
00:15:31.104 - 00:15:50.512, Speaker A: You know, after two episodes, it's like a binary state. It's either final or it's not. You're right, it's probabilistic with proof of work. Okay, so, and then what happened then? So the network, the nodes, when we talk about the network not being able to reach finality during these periods, are we saying that the validators couldn't agree on finality or what happened? Exactly.
00:15:50.568 - 00:17:01.614, Speaker C: So two clients, Prism and tecu, are, they're not the super majority of clients, but they comprise, I think, roughly maybe around half of all nodes on Ethereum. Those two nodes were having difficulty processing old attestations. So attestations are votes from validators about what the head of the chain is. And every time they were receiving an old attestation, they were basically trying to verify that attestation by replaying chain state. And that's very computationally intensive, like generating kind of like the entire state of a chain at a certain point back in history, created a lot of cpu load on these nodes, and so these nodes couldn't process new attestations when validators were trying to progress the chain, Prism and Techu were having difficulty, and so that's why you had a period of delayed finality, because these nodes weren't processing their attestations correctly. Luckily, TecU and Prism basically adopted the same solution. That lighthouse, which is another client that also has about 30, if not 40%, of popularity among validator node operators.
00:17:01.614 - 00:17:33.430, Speaker C: The way that lighthouse handles those old attestations is if the old attestation doesn't contribute to the fork choice rule, they just drop the attestation. Like, they don't replace the state, they don't try and verify that old attestation at all. And so basically, the release, the new fix that was cut by Prism and tech goo, basically a day after, I think less than 24 hours after the bug was identified on Friday, the fix was basically to adopt that same logic, that same process.
00:17:33.502 - 00:17:45.102, Speaker A: So they were just getting bogged down with work that technically didn't need to be done at all, and that was preventing a large portion of validators from actually doing the work on the actual chain tip that had to be done to reach finality, I guess.
00:17:45.158 - 00:18:45.534, Speaker C: Yeah. One of the devs called it kind of like a pseudo DDoS attack because it was like an overloading of what the nodes were supposed to do so that they couldn't do their proper work. But the root cause of it, of why these old test attestations were running around in the network, some people had assumed or had speculated, was this an attack? Was this a malicious actor that was propagating these old attestations? And the more devs are investing, and they still are, they actually have a call tomorrow. We're recording this on Wednesday of May 17, but there will be a call tomorrow on May 18. We'll talk more about this. But about Devs were, the more they investigated, they understood that what actually caused these old asset shows was likely the lighthouse client. The way that they reconnect to the network after, if they accidentally disconnect from the execution layer, which is the layer on which smart contracts are executed, transactions are executed.
00:18:45.534 - 00:19:54.384, Speaker C: If certain nodes, like the lighthouse client, when they disconnect from. From the execution layer, the way that they reconnect is by propagating these old attestations. And apparently one of the causes for what was going on was this activity lighthouse nodes were disconnected, and when they were reconnecting, they were propagating old attestations. And it's a very uncommon experience. But developers think that that's what caused this to happen. And one of the interesting things that Terrence said on a bankless podcast today was that with the amount of people that are on the beacon chain today, like 600,000 active active validators, the test nets that Ethereum has for the beacon chain are just not large enough to replicate certain on chain events because testnets are around 400,000 active validators. And second of all, with Shanghai, the influx of new deposits, staked ETH deposits, was also not something that developers had really been able to accurately replay or anticipate on testnets.
00:19:54.384 - 00:20:29.676, Speaker C: So I think all of this really goes to show that the beacon chain is a new consensus protocol. It is a new living network, like a new living blockchain that is in the wild for the first time. And proof of stake as like, the transition to proof of stake only recently got finalized with Shanghai. So I think it kind of makes sense that as it starts to become more widely adopted, you have these unforeseen issues of like, we didn't know that the network couldn't handle old associations in this way. For Prism and tech goo, I think.
00:20:29.700 - 00:21:03.886, Speaker A: That'S really well explained. I feel like I get it. Thank you, Christine. Okay, before we move on, because you mentioned the staking stuff, we're going to get into the deposits and withdrawals from, uh, uh, of staked ETH. But let's talk just quickly about the implications here. I guess during the finality, these outages or lacks of finality being achieved? Um, what is that downtime? Was the network down, or like, what was the users experience during those times? And is this a problem going forward in the future, you know, for ethereum broadly, or is this sort of like a, you know, not a big deal?
00:21:03.990 - 00:22:07.882, Speaker C: So what end users experienced during this time of delayed finality where slightly higher gas prices, I think the average was, it was slightly higher than the daily average, about 120 instead of like 100, and then slower block time. So block times are usually 12 seconds. But I believe certain block times because of delayed, because of the issues that these nodes were experiencing, were not able to propose blocks for up to something like a minute. So really the impact on end users was very minimal. People were still able to send their transactions, but, you know, their transactions were processing a little bit longer than usual, they had to pay a little bit more than they did. But network activity continued to operate just as normal. Really? I think the biggest impact was on exchanges and roll ups that depend on finality for transactions, in that if an exchange is transferring a large sum of value, they're not going to want to start to, to also process transactions on top of that large trend transfer until they know that first transfer was complete.
00:22:08.018 - 00:22:39.200, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I guess that's the issue, right? Because when you talk about finality, like, but I guess what, it was a short enough amount of time, theoretically we're talking about, there's a risk that the chain would, like, roll back to some prior state, so you get caught and a double spend of some kind could happen. Right. But like, why wasn't that, that sounds like a big deal to me. Right. But like, is it because it was a short amount of time or because in reality, like, could you have double spent during this time and like, made use of this as an attack vector? Or is this somehow, is that not how it works? Basically?
00:22:39.312 - 00:23:01.242, Speaker C: So if the exchange had, you know, sent that amount of money and then done multiple transactions on top of it, and those transactions got reversed because finality hadn't been confirmed on the network, then the exchange would have to reverse certain transactions on their front end to the users. Like, that would definitely be a problem, I would say, for an exchange.
00:23:01.298 - 00:23:17.034, Speaker A: But, like, there's no evidence that there was any kind of rollback during this period of lack of finality, right? So, like, nothing actually did happen, but like, how it theoretically could have. Is that what we are being told? Like, is that the issue? But it didn't though. Like, there was no block that was undone, right?
00:23:17.114 - 00:23:17.810, Speaker C: No blocks were undone.
00:23:17.842 - 00:23:25.062, Speaker A: Finally they did. And finally they did all become final in that same order that they should have. Right. So it was fine.
00:23:25.198 - 00:24:27.994, Speaker C: And I think that also comes to the point of why we don't think this was done by a malicious actor or nefariously. And the reason why we emphasize, you know, the, the importance of finality for exchanges and roll ups is just to illustrate why we have that checkpoint in the first place. And I will say that, that people who are kind of perpetuating this narrative that ethereum was down, there was an outage on ethereum, is kind of over exaggerating exactly how long of a period the delay in finality was. The validators that went offline and actually experienced the inactivity leak, which is this penalty that kicks in when the network sees a very large majority of validators go offline and the network is unable to finalize. The network kicks in to penalize validators and try and reach finality. But when that was happening, the validators that went offline, on average, lost about a dollar. Really?
00:24:29.054 - 00:24:35.966, Speaker A: So really, it's built to penalize way more under way bigger circumstances than the minor inactivity leak that happened.
00:24:35.990 - 00:24:36.454, Speaker C: Is your point?
00:24:36.494 - 00:24:37.902, Speaker A: It was a minor, yes.
00:24:37.958 - 00:25:08.456, Speaker C: And the penalty increases the longer ethereum is unable to finalize. So the fact that only about, like a dollar, on average, per validator got lost, that means that finality wasn't delayed for that for such a long period of time that the network thought, you know, we're going to have issues with, like, longer term issues of, say, if it's a seven day waiting period for a roll up, like an optimistic roll up that has a seven day fraud proof window, and your network's not able to reach finality for seven days, that's. That's another major issue.
00:25:08.520 - 00:25:09.328, Speaker A: That's a big deal.
00:25:09.416 - 00:25:11.600, Speaker C: Yeah, but we didn't get there. You know, it was really like.
00:25:11.632 - 00:25:12.016, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:12.120 - 00:25:13.720, Speaker C: Yeah. Like a day, Max.
00:25:13.912 - 00:25:42.616, Speaker A: Well, and when you think about it, your point about bitcoin? I mean, I think most exchanges now do, like, about a three block, they would. About three blocks. But the convention used to be wait six blocks before, just because if you look at bitcoins like orphan block, stale block history, like, there's. There hasn't been like a three block reorgan long time. Right. But everyone used to wait six blocks, which, by the way, is an hour on average. So it's like ETH, you know, being, you know, not reaching formal finality for an hour.
00:25:42.616 - 00:25:58.496, Speaker A: I guess it wasn't too big. Would have been a big deal if we saw some kind of blocks get unrolled. Right. Like, in the end, if the chain tip ended up being different than where, uh, everyone saw it. That's a literal reorg. There was no reorg. So it was just a slight delay in certainty, I guess.
00:25:58.600 - 00:26:00.184, Speaker C: Exactly. A slight delay in certain.
00:26:00.224 - 00:26:08.304, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, let's talk about steak teeth. No, I like it, I think. Thank you. I came up with that on the spot. Um, no, you just taught me. I appreciate.
00:26:08.304 - 00:26:14.206, Speaker A: I know our audience does, too. Um, because I didn't know what to make of it, uh, you know, and I don't think a lot of people did.
00:26:14.280 - 00:26:15.138, Speaker C: And I like the wording.
00:26:15.186 - 00:26:18.402, Speaker A: I'm happy they got to. I'm happy they got to the bottom of it.
00:26:18.538 - 00:26:18.834, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:18.874 - 00:26:26.106, Speaker A: Because for a while, for a couple of days, people couldn't. I mean, not us. I certainly couldn't figure out what was going on. But, like, devs were unclear as to exactly what happened.
00:26:26.250 - 00:26:34.714, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I think there was really a period of time when. So Preston was on the bankless podcast, was talking about how the last.
00:26:34.794 - 00:26:35.826, Speaker A: Preston Van Loon, right?
00:26:35.890 - 00:27:13.128, Speaker C: Yes. From the prism client team. He was talking about how in 2021, prism was the super majority, as they were like 80%, 90% of the network, and they were unable to produce blocks for some mysterious reason, and they couldn't figure it out for three days. So when he heard that Mainnet stopped finalizing in, like today, basically not today, but like last week, he was very concerned, you know, that it would take days to figure out the root cause. But it sounds like developers have it pretty much mapped out, and, you know, we're able to release those fixes less than 24 hours after they identified what was going on.
00:27:13.176 - 00:27:34.144, Speaker A: Let's talk about staked ETH. This is your, this was a huge topic. It's, I guess. Is it now? It seems like kind of mundane in a good way. There was what, after Shanghai, Capella went live, there was some outflow, a modest outflow of validators. But that has fully reversed now. Correct.
00:27:34.144 - 00:27:42.134, Speaker A: And now we're seeing just, the validators are just growing. ETH is pouring into stake. Is that what's happening? Tell us what's happening on the staking front.
00:27:42.254 - 00:28:23.386, Speaker C: That really is what's happening. I'm shocked myself. I did not expect such a quick turnaround from the number of full withdrawals and partial withdrawals that we were seeing for deposits to just completely surpass the amount of both full withdrawals and partial withdrawals combined. On Monday, Lido, the largest staking provider, activated stake deep withdrawals. They allowed redemptions of their liquid staking token steeth for ETH. And the number of withdrawals that have been happening. And the amount has been extremely minimal, except around 90% of what we saw of steeth being redeemed was from a single entity, Celsius.
00:28:23.386 - 00:28:52.484, Speaker C: It appears that Celsius has been redeeming, is in the process of redeeming their staked ETH from Lido, and that appears to be really the largest entity withdrawing right now. Other than that, we're seeing just large numbers of validators staking into Ethereum, through rocket pool, through lido, through fracs, through many different staking pools. So, yeah, I would say the biggest withdrawal activity right now is from the Celsius Lido.
00:28:53.624 - 00:29:02.446, Speaker A: Is that confirmed that it was Celsius? I saw a lot of people saying that it looked like it was on ether scan or something, like people were convinced that it was Celsius.
00:29:02.600 - 00:29:24.378, Speaker C: Yeah, I think some people were talking about whether or not it was a specific redeemer, like a specific user of Celsius trying to redeem their Steve that we're not sure about. But I do think that it, the labeling has been confirmed that it is coming from Celsius, could possibly be the company, could be a different individual that is trying to redeem.
00:29:24.426 - 00:29:32.454, Speaker A: But yeah, okay, cool. And so, gosh, so what else, anything else you're watching on Ethereum that we should pay attention to the next weeks and months?
00:29:33.154 - 00:30:47.744, Speaker C: Definitely keep paying attention to the next preparations for the next upgrade. Developers have pretty much scoped out what's going to be going into Cancun. And of course, the main EIP, the main code change going into it is EIP 4844, proto dang sharding. I'm doing a lot of research lately on really getting into the nitty gritty of what Proto dank sharding is and how it works. And it's very clear to me that lots of the eips that are going into Cancun are in some way related to EIP 4844, even though they're separate eips. So like Ethereum's upgrade to SSE, which is like a transaction serialization format, that's what the beacon chain is based off of, but not what the execution layer is based off of. The harmonization effort to make those serialization formats the same, or like upgrade execution layer serialization format from RLP to SSE, that process is heavily impacted by EIP 4844 because if EIP 4844 uses SSC, then the question becomes, should the entirety of the execution layer use SSC? So these kinds of conversations that sound very technical are things that will definitely impact, I guess, like the timeline and also kind of the risks associated with the next upgrade.
00:30:47.744 - 00:30:52.404, Speaker C: So I'd say keep an eye out on those, on those efforts.
00:30:53.224 - 00:31:45.632, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, I'm excited to see how it goes. The Ethereum, the crypto space now feels so bitcoin and ETH focused. I do think there are other interesting ecosystems too. But even I'm out and about here in Miami and this week, and there's so much discussion with the emergence of ordinals and a lot of people coming back to try to build things. I was at an event called Pleb Phi, which is like a bitcoin hacker builder conference, and now sort of like maybe on the backs of ordinals and inscriptions and sort of the developer interest that that is driving now there's all of a sudden feels like there's some more momentum for the other bitcoin upgrades, check template, verify any prev out vault something like this, which, something along those, or at least an opcode necessary to do roll ups on bitcoin. More people are talking about that too.
00:31:45.632 - 00:32:19.378, Speaker A: Really feels like it's sort of a bitcoin. And, you know, not that they're talking about Ethereum here much at the bitcoin conferences, but that it's, it's. These are the questions. It's roll ups, it's um, it's. And it's applications and I know there's people building on other ecosystems as well, but I feel like just in this macro environment, like, you know, you can't. I even myself, I might find it hard to go further down the crypto risk curve and rabbit hole than ETH. It starts to be like, I feel like I'm thinking about bitcoin ETH, like dollars, gold and rates.
00:32:19.378 - 00:32:39.078, Speaker A: Like this year, it doesn't feel like a long tail. This is, I guess, why we're in a. It's a builder's market, not, not a, you know, it's a bear market builder vibe at this point. If you're beyond the. All the investors and people I'm talking to are basically like not really doing much beyond bitcoin and ETH at this point, I guess, is what I'm trying to get to. Both very exciting ecosystems, though.
00:32:39.186 - 00:32:56.278, Speaker C: Yeah. And I, I will say there's plenty of, of. Still lots of. Lots of shit Coiner II happening on top of bitcoin and ethereum, though. Like, even though you don't go beyond ethereum and bitcoin, there's still a lot to dive into. Plenty of stuff happening in there on those two.
00:32:56.326 - 00:33:22.936, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, totally, totally. Well, it's great conversation as always. Our friend Christine Kim from Galaxy Research, thanks for joining us today.
