00:00:04.840 - 00:00:53.718, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Yo, I'm back with the rap as your humble teacher, cryptographiti has her killer t shirts. Yo, I'm drippin and orange peelin every single creature stay in your lane keep a couple guardrails when you're playin the game be above your hard veils when you look at the curve recognize as barbell. Our guest is FBI man Chris Tarbell. Yo, we killed the Silk Road, and he locked up Ross, but he knows his crypto. It's a big brain talk, yo, I glisten when I walk in my bitcoin dunks making chains super heavy like the bitcoin punks see, I sift through the chumps when I flow so hard got 99 problems but none is bars the sun to Mars I'd be killing fallacies top down, feed up flying through galaxies as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains.
00:00:53.718 - 00:01:02.980, Speaker A: We have a great show for you today. Former FBI special agent Chris Tarbell is our guest. He's the man who personally arrested Ross Ulbricht and led the investigation into the Silk Road.
00:01:03.092 - 00:01:04.612, Speaker B: He's also the host of the podcast.
00:01:04.668 - 00:01:20.344, Speaker A: Hacker and the Fed. A great listen, and I think you're gonna be really interested in this conversation in general, but specifically, Chris's views on privacy and cryptography, I think you'll find quite intriguing. We'll also check in with our good friend Bibnet A. Bibi from Galaxy trading to talk markets and macro, as always.
00:01:20.924 - 00:01:24.900, Speaker B: But before we get into it, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer on the podcast notes.

00:01:37.384 - 00:01:42.624, Speaker B: Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Great to see you here. You were on vacation last week.
00:01:42.664 - 00:01:43.048, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:43.136 - 00:01:45.048, Speaker B: We had a good stand in. I know.
00:01:45.136 - 00:01:47.004, Speaker D: Not a bad guy to have it.
00:01:47.944 - 00:01:48.712, Speaker B: How's it going?
00:01:48.808 - 00:01:50.776, Speaker D: It's going great. It's going great. How are you doing?
00:01:50.840 - 00:01:54.136, Speaker B: I'm good. It's been a bit of a rocky ride.
00:01:54.240 - 00:01:54.680, Speaker C: Yep.
00:01:54.752 - 00:02:06.384, Speaker B: The last few weeks in crypto, I guess, in all markets. But we've already talked about the bank runs and crises, which I guess, I don't know if we can say it's abated, but it's now at a low.
00:02:06.424 - 00:02:51.294, Speaker D: Simmer it's at a low simmer. But what I would say is that, one, it's still a point of conversation across basically every boardroom and kitchen table in the sense that bank rates are incredibly low and treasuries are incredibly compelling in the context of bank rates. And two, the safety around regional banks is still under question. And the third thing I'd like to highlight is that most people are like, oh, this stuff is abating. And they're looking at data that is really old. The Fed's discount window usage data and the facility data normally is on a one week lag. And so the data we have now.
00:02:51.294 - 00:03:36.990, Speaker D: And this is what data, is it like March 30, 29th or something? Yeah, it's March 9. Pretty sure it only covers like the 15th or something like that. So people understanding of how much usage of these facilities is lagged, I think you're probably still at the point where usage is likely to increase. I think the clear implications of what's likely to happen are pretty clear. One, bank rates are probably going to have to get more competitive. Your JPMorgans, boas, citigroups of the world, the large bulge bracket, gsibs of the world are going to have to raise rates to stay competitive. And even the regional guys, they are probably also going to have to raise rates to stay competitive.
00:03:37.062 - 00:03:37.838, Speaker C: Deposits. Right.
00:03:37.926 - 00:03:50.134, Speaker D: And they're probably going to lose deposits, and you're probably going to have a contraction in credit and lending, and that's going to reverberate throughout the economy and the impacts are yet to be felt.
00:03:50.254 - 00:03:53.994, Speaker B: So it's on the simmer, it's not abated, but it's ongoing.
00:03:54.294 - 00:03:55.014, Speaker D: Ongoing.
00:03:55.094 - 00:04:15.594, Speaker B: I will say, though, you had crypto, you had bitcoin. Obviously, we talked about this, performed very well the week. And we just apparently issues with the block, issues with the Wi Fi in here. But we're at like, as we speak, we're at 28, 450 or so on bitcoin, which is almost at pre fed high, to be honest.
00:04:15.634 - 00:04:15.786, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:15.810 - 00:04:17.274, Speaker B: So we came off a lot after.
00:04:17.314 - 00:04:19.746, Speaker D: Yeah, we're at the one year high or trend high?
00:04:19.850 - 00:04:20.410, Speaker B: Yeah, trend high.
00:04:20.442 - 00:04:20.658, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:20.706 - 00:04:28.300, Speaker B: And so we came off after Jay pal was hawkish and they, and they raised and they signaled more raises. They didn't come out with a dovish hike. It was a hike.
00:04:28.452 - 00:04:31.476, Speaker D: Yeah, it was a hike. And they still told you their dot plus.
00:04:31.500 - 00:04:33.540, Speaker B: So then we dumped and then we came. And then we came back.
00:04:33.652 - 00:04:34.108, Speaker C: Yep.
00:04:34.196 - 00:04:52.884, Speaker B: And then this CFTC case against binance came out and we, I wouldn't say we dumped, but we bled lower into the 26s. But then overnight last night, we rallied back to trend high again. So it seems very resilient. Bitcoin and you know, and ETH obviously like. But bitcoin is the main marker here. Very resilient in the face of a lot of turmoil.
00:04:53.004 - 00:05:25.404, Speaker D: Incredibly resilient. The technicals are super strong right now. When you see price action like this, we're on track to post a bullish outside month, or what's known as an outside reversal. Technically, what that speaks to is you set a lower low than the prior month and yet you're going to close above the high of the previous month. And you're coming from a pretty low base. And this is going to be the third month in a row where it's up. And so it strongly suggests, you know, trend continuation.
00:05:25.404 - 00:05:40.144, Speaker D: And we know that 28, you know, twenty eight k, twenty eight four is resistance. So if you close above there, especially on quarter end, I mean, technically speaking, it looks incredibly constructive to the upside.
00:05:40.304 - 00:05:42.896, Speaker B: Week, month, quarter. They all look nice.
00:05:43.000 - 00:06:04.120, Speaker D: Absolutely. Basically every meaningful dip this year has been bought. It speaks of a market that is under positioned and feels like they don't have the upside. It trades like folks are short gamma in certain instances, which can further perpetuate a squeeze higher. The other sort of big picture macro thing that I'm keeping an eye on is gold.
00:06:04.272 - 00:06:04.608, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:04.656 - 00:06:08.360, Speaker D: You're constantly testing two k. Now that is an all time high.
00:06:08.432 - 00:06:12.056, Speaker B: That's got a break, right? I mean it's been testing it for weeks now, right?
00:06:12.240 - 00:06:37.258, Speaker D: It has. And I definitely think that the banking crisis and the flight to quality and the bidding treasuries, et cetera, has helped. But technically speaking, if you break through the highs that the gold has set, you will be in price discovery and folks will be talking about how under invested they are to gold as it is breaking out to new all time highs. And what is bitcoin but digital gold? Or it could be many things, but.
00:06:37.346 - 00:06:38.386, Speaker B: A lot of people view it that way.
00:06:38.410 - 00:06:38.890, Speaker C: I agree.
00:06:39.002 - 00:06:41.282, Speaker D: And that's my primary view of it as a dollar.
00:06:41.338 - 00:06:45.306, Speaker B: You've talked for a long time too about the bitcoin gold chart as one.
00:06:45.330 - 00:06:46.250, Speaker C: That you like to the ratio.
00:06:46.322 - 00:06:47.274, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely.
00:06:47.394 - 00:07:11.082, Speaker B: And yeah, I mean, I think, I think it's very clear too. I mean, you see safe haven trade happening with gold. There's also the geopolitical stuff that is favors favorable to gold. And I mean, I don't know yet. I'm not saying that, you know, the nation states of the world or the sovereign, the sovereigns or anyone else is yet using bitcoin in that way. But they could. And they, and they are using gold that way a lot right now.
00:07:11.138 - 00:07:11.658, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:07:11.706 - 00:07:19.210, Speaker B: Because you got this whole dynamic with Russia and China and Saudi and India and like none of whom really want dollars. Saudi's in bed with us still.
00:07:19.402 - 00:07:21.194, Speaker D: But they're, they have enough dollars.
00:07:21.274 - 00:07:24.018, Speaker B: They have plenty of dollars and they're quartering the Chinese pretty.
00:07:24.146 - 00:07:25.306, Speaker D: So absolutely.
00:07:25.410 - 00:07:31.538, Speaker B: There's a demand for a non dollar, you know, settled trade and perhaps other, now you're not going to settle trade.
00:07:31.586 - 00:07:35.562, Speaker D: Physically with gold, but there's a demand for dollar alternatives.
00:07:35.618 - 00:07:35.810, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:35.842 - 00:07:36.362, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:07:36.458 - 00:08:31.216, Speaker D: And there's strong interest from global players to end the dollar dominance. Not necessarily to take it over with rubles, but the fact that the US can just print money infinitely gives it such a tremendous advantage over the world from a trade security from various perspectives. There's a lot of folks that are actively trying to move away from that. I think one of the key things about gold is that you actually have central banks that buy it, BBoc being a big one. But other central banks across the world, right, there's a, you know, basically they print money on the side by gold and so, you know, there's a healthy demand for it. I think, you know, if you're looking at global asset allocators are probably underweight gold as well. So there's positioning oriented, you know, potential.
00:08:31.216 - 00:09:25.292, Speaker D: There's central bank oriented buying potential and then there's the technical break of, you know, two k or 2100 that likely going to get meaningful follow through. So I think there's a lot of constructive things at play. And then the other thing, and my favorite thesis about gold or one of the reasons why I like it a lot is because of the price action over the past two years. If you think about where gold was at the start of the US tightening cycle and what the markets went through, Nasdaq plunging, bonds selling off like crazy, flash crashes in the pound in the yen. Right. Like we went through an incredible year of global macro markets. And what did gold do from the start of 22 to end of 23? It was basically unchanged in one of the most historic years and markets ever.
00:09:25.292 - 00:09:59.720, Speaker D: And that just shows you how strong of a store of value it is. Right. And two, like if it can withstand huge macro risk off, well, how's it really going to perform in huge macro risk on when the world realizes that you're going to be at low rates for a really long time and it's basically structurally impossible to get back to a higher rate regime. And so I like gold. And I want to protect myself against dollar debasement. And I think bitcoin is the better way to play it. But I definitely see gold doing well.
00:09:59.872 - 00:10:15.240, Speaker B: Let's talk about rates, because we had the 25 bip hike. We were joking here, and I think this is overheard on the street. In general, a lot of people thought it would either be a hawkish pause or a dovish hike. I think we actually got a pretty hawkish hike. I mean, a smaller hike.
00:10:15.272 - 00:10:16.688, Speaker D: I would say it's probably a hawkish hike.
00:10:16.736 - 00:10:31.176, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, and that, that's why markets reacted negatively but have rebounded. At least crypto has rebounded. But, you know, we were joking. Like, you know, we look at the, where, where the sort of, what do they call, is it a futures market for rates that we look at the.
00:10:31.200 - 00:10:33.256, Speaker D: Street where, you know, swaps.
00:10:33.320 - 00:10:33.864, Speaker C: Swaps, yes.
00:10:33.904 - 00:10:35.688, Speaker D: Fed funds, sofas.
00:10:35.816 - 00:10:53.438, Speaker B: And this had, in the end, they, the market had come to an agreement. It was more likely than not going to be a 25 bps hike, which is where that ended. But what are they pricing now? Because it looks like the market is still sort of against the Fed on this, doing even cuts by as early as July.
00:10:53.526 - 00:10:53.750, Speaker C: Right?
00:10:53.782 - 00:10:56.354, Speaker D: Is that what it looks like halfway through the year?
00:10:56.654 - 00:10:58.366, Speaker B: But the Fed is really signaling that.
00:10:58.430 - 00:11:22.174, Speaker D: They don't, like, cut through this year. Basically, the Fed's like, we're going to take rates to like, you know, around 5%. 510 is where the dot plot had things. The terminal rates are currently priced at 491, expected to peak next meeting, basically. And then you have about another 50, 60 basis points of cuts price through this year. I think.
00:11:23.914 - 00:11:28.258, Speaker B: The market is currently kind of calling the Fed bluff. They're saying the Fed's bluffing.
00:11:28.346 - 00:11:28.938, Speaker C: Basically.
00:11:29.066 - 00:11:30.226, Speaker B: They're disagreeing with the Fed.
00:11:30.290 - 00:12:11.242, Speaker D: They're disagreeing with the Fed. And I think it's totally reasonable to disagree with the Fed, particularly in the context of what we know is going to be a very slow consumer in the back half of this year. And data that's probably going to slow again, we've talked about as student loans, you have to start repaying auto loans, the ballooning auto loan payments, the continual decline in savings balances and credit card balances going up. We know the back half of the year, I think, is going to be really slow data wise. And I think the market is picking up on that. And the market's saying, oh, Fed's going to see that data. Fed's going to see owner's equivalent rent moving lower.
00:12:11.242 - 00:12:52.004, Speaker D: They're going to react to that. They're going to react and the credit conditions are tightening, blah, blah, blah. At the same time, the market has to price in what kind of a cut? Because a cut can be 25 basis points, 50 basis points, or 100 or even 200 probability weight, like what you think the first cut is going to be and when it's going to be. So that leads to certain distortions in the pricing. But largely speaking, I think the biggest takeaway is that the right tail of rate risk has gone away from the market. We're not in a world where we're feasibly taking rates up to 6% plus seven, eight.
00:12:52.304 - 00:12:54.728, Speaker B: That right tails impossible right now.
00:12:54.856 - 00:12:55.328, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:12:55.376 - 00:12:55.512, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:55.528 - 00:13:05.472, Speaker D: Yeah. And so the idea that rates have peaked or expectations for terminal rates have peaked has fully set into the market. And I think that is, can the.
00:13:05.488 - 00:13:06.964, Speaker B: Market be wrong about this?
00:13:09.464 - 00:13:10.224, Speaker C: Potentially?
00:13:10.264 - 00:13:44.044, Speaker D: The area where it could be wrong is twofold. The labor market is still tight as basically been in history. 3536 unemployment rate, nobody's losing jobs quite yet in a meaningful way. You get a spiraling wage pressures, et cetera, kind of takes inflation higher. The other is like commodity complex. Right? If crude oil for some reason went to $100 a barrel tomorrow, we'd have inflation issues again. And so, yeah, there are scenarios where inflation does tick up.
00:13:44.664 - 00:14:02.628, Speaker B: So basically, if inflation is high, it's stubborn, it becomes even bigger problem. Let's say, then Powell's got to go Volcker and really smack us down. And then the right tail of higher rates really could rear its head. Yeah, but outside of that, outside of that market's pretty clear. Like we're like, yeah, there we're chilling.
00:14:02.676 - 00:14:18.748, Speaker D: And generally speaking, you, like, you can ask if you asked me a year ago or right when we started the tightening cycle. Yeah, like when I think it'd be a great time to own bitcoin. I tell you, it's probably when the fed ends its hiking cycle.
00:14:18.756 - 00:14:18.852, Speaker C: Right?
00:14:18.868 - 00:14:20.884, Speaker B: When it goes stops or like just.
00:14:20.924 - 00:14:46.598, Speaker D: Right before in and around, around there. Right? Big picture of thinkers trying to think about this asset class from the perspective of where it's going to be a couple of years down the line and in the kind of terminal state of monetary policy. And so right here, right now, and I'm looking at the end of US monetary tightening and the US looking at the real limits, starts to look at.
00:14:46.606 - 00:14:48.926, Speaker B: It seriously and think about, and the.
00:14:48.950 - 00:15:24.808, Speaker D: Other thing while we're on bonds, it's so crazy. Bill Gross had this tweet the other day, Bond king, former bond king at Pimco. He's probably gone a little crazy. Now. But again, he spoke to one of the key points about the state of debt at the moment, that being you need more debt to just refinance the existing debt out there in the US. It's really tough for me. I understand bond markets really well, you know, running twin deficits and how those deficits gets financed by central banks, foreign parties, et cetera.
00:15:24.808 - 00:16:25.962, Speaker D: And I have a solid appreciation for what money is and how it gets moved and stuff. And my terminal state of monetary policy always gets me to, you want to be long gold, you want to be long bitcoin, you want to be long, hard assets, because money is constantly being devalued. And I think it's a natural conclusion most people get to. But I think more and more as you get through this stage and people realize that it's bailouts, it's stimulus checks, it's student loan forgiveness in perpetuity forever. And rates aren't going up, and your bank account's not going to pay you money even though the rates are going up. And just how quickly money moves now, the ability to go from Fiat to crypto or from one fiat location to another fiat location, you know, I think all of that is really going to start become self reinforcing and, you know, people are going to become aware, but it's just a matter of time. Just a matter of time, I think.
00:16:26.058 - 00:16:29.530, Speaker B: Bimnet, abibi Galaxy trading. Great to have you as always, my friend.
00:16:29.602 - 00:16:30.306, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:16:30.450 - 00:16:38.754, Speaker B: Let's go now to our guest, Chris Tarbell, former FBI agent, current cybersecurity consultant, host of Hacker and the Fed podcast. Welcome, my friend.
00:16:38.834 - 00:16:39.114, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:16:39.154 - 00:16:40.246, Speaker E: Thanks for having me on the show.
00:16:40.370 - 00:17:01.990, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm super excited to have you. I've been excited since we got this in the books for a lot of reasons. So. So for our listeners, Chris was the lead case agent on the Silk Road investigation into Ross Ulbricht. So we're going to talk a lot about that, but also, as you can tell, given that background and your current activities, knows a lot about bitcoin and crypto, and I'd love to pick your brain on a range of topics.
00:17:02.102 - 00:17:21.084, Speaker E: Sounds good. Yeah, I got into crypto really early and not so much into it anymore. You know, I work at a. I co founded a cybersecurity firm called Naxo, and we, you know, crypto is part of our stuff. But, you know, I work with a really smart guy who's much better at crypto than I am. He actually, we work together on the Silk Road. I brought him in to help me on Silk Road.
00:17:21.084 - 00:17:26.528, Speaker E: And he did most of the crypto there. And so, you know, love to talk to you about crypto.
00:17:26.576 - 00:17:26.776, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:26.800 - 00:17:41.412, Speaker B: So let's start with the Silk Road, I think. Well, I mean, it was an iconic moment in cybersecurity. It was an iconic moment, obviously, for bitcoin at the time. It was basically a bitcoin only market. So, uh, Silk Road was but, like, the whole market.
00:17:41.468 - 00:17:41.612, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:41.628 - 00:17:53.628, Speaker B: There weren't all these other cryptos, even back then. Um, and a lot of people, I think, objectively, was sort of like, Ross Ulbricht took the bitcoin concept all the way to its, like, perfect final destination.
00:17:53.716 - 00:17:53.940, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:53.972 - 00:17:57.916, Speaker B: Like, he used it as money for illegal activity because it could be.
00:17:57.980 - 00:17:58.324, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:58.404 - 00:18:05.564, Speaker B: Um, you know what? I guess, let me start off really poor question. What was it like working on that investigation?
00:18:05.604 - 00:18:05.780, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:05.812 - 00:18:28.636, Speaker E: It was great. So, yeah, I mean, Silk Road was an odd thing back then because, you know, do cybercrime, the investigation goes, track the IP addresses and track the money. That's the two things. And, you know, Ross had found a way to use Tor to avoid us being able to track IP addresses and this new thing, crypto, back in the day, so we couldn't trace the money. You know, there were no chain analysis. There was no nothing of that.
00:18:28.700 - 00:18:32.052, Speaker B: So you had to find him. You found him in the library in San Francisco.
00:18:32.108 - 00:18:32.276, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:32.300 - 00:18:33.956, Speaker B: He's actually physically caught at that point.
00:18:34.020 - 00:18:34.364, Speaker C: He was.
00:18:34.404 - 00:18:37.620, Speaker E: I found him in his house. Luckily, he left the house and came down to the library.
00:18:37.652 - 00:18:38.698, Speaker B: Made it a little easier.
00:18:38.876 - 00:18:46.998, Speaker E: Made it a lot easier, because we had learned a lesson from a previous hacker that we arrested, that the laptop was the most important thing. More important than the actual man.
00:18:47.046 - 00:18:52.454, Speaker B: I want to ask you about that, because he was. You see him in the library. You guys have a team there. Whatever, you end up seizing him.
00:18:52.494 - 00:18:52.670, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:52.702 - 00:18:54.822, Speaker B: And, of course, he tries to close the laptop.
00:18:54.878 - 00:18:55.118, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:55.166 - 00:18:59.214, Speaker B: And this is in a cyber investigation. A lot of computers are encrypted.
00:18:59.294 - 00:18:59.534, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:59.574 - 00:19:06.046, Speaker B: Like, if you don't have the password, it could be very difficult to get in. So you want to always, like, capture the flash memory if you can, right away.
00:19:06.110 - 00:19:06.334, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:06.374 - 00:19:12.174, Speaker B: And you want to keep it open. Like, don't let him log out. Don't let him lock it down. Is that. Was that an important takeaway here?
00:19:12.254 - 00:19:21.558, Speaker E: That was the most important. I, you know, I gave the execute command to arrest him, and the, you know, it was like, part of the message was, you know, let Ross run if he has to. We'll get him later.
00:19:21.606 - 00:19:22.614, Speaker B: You want to?
00:19:22.614 - 00:19:27.910, Speaker E: Because we arrested another guy and he closed the laptop and it took us a long time to get into that computer.
00:19:27.982 - 00:19:34.846, Speaker B: So the FBI seized a bunch of bitcoin over the course of these Silk Road. First the Ross's Silk Road.
00:19:34.910 - 00:19:35.110, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:35.142 - 00:19:39.838, Speaker B: And then it was, what, rebooted again by others. And then those people were also caught.
00:19:39.886 - 00:19:40.638, Speaker C: Right? Yep.
00:19:40.726 - 00:19:47.254, Speaker B: So what was off the top of your head? I mean, I think I've heard, like, about 150,000 bitcoin, basically, in total was seized from these things.
00:19:47.334 - 00:19:50.134, Speaker E: Well, just from Ross's was 177,000.
00:19:50.174 - 00:19:50.662, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:19:50.758 - 00:19:52.326, Speaker E: A little over 177,000.
00:19:52.390 - 00:19:52.974, Speaker C: So, yeah.
00:19:53.054 - 00:19:54.502, Speaker B: And some of that was auctioned.
00:19:54.598 - 00:19:54.926, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:54.990 - 00:20:05.894, Speaker B: We know, I think pretty famously, Tim Draper, the venture capitalist, bought, like, the whole slug of one of these auctions. But what they still hold, the government still has a bunch of this bitcoin.
00:20:06.354 - 00:20:23.074, Speaker E: To be honest, I don't really know what it is. Like I said, that smart guy Matt Edmond that I work with, he's a co founder at Naxo, too. We went to his apartment and we logged in and we transferred it over in chunks of 324 because on a telephone, 324 says FBI, because we wanted to troll the Internet that day.
00:20:23.114 - 00:20:23.634, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:20:23.714 - 00:20:26.858, Speaker E: And then went and ate barbecue across the street and then came back when it finished.
00:20:26.906 - 00:20:37.842, Speaker B: So, Matt, basically, you got his laptop, you got access to the wallets, and then he just, like, writes a bunch of bitcoin transactions and broadcast them onto the bitcoin network to just seize the money. Yeah, we had to do a fresh wallet.
00:20:37.938 - 00:21:00.442, Speaker E: He went to Iceland. When I arrested Ross, he was sitting in Iceland with a couple FBI agents, and he was able to seize the coins over there. We transferred them, put them on a thumb drive. I had to walk around with them for three days in my pocket because the safe only opens on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Unbelievable. And so, yeah, then we went to Matt's one night and transferred him over there while we ate barbecue.
00:21:00.498 - 00:21:00.890, Speaker B: That's amazing.
00:21:00.922 - 00:21:01.650, Speaker E: It was a great night.
00:21:01.722 - 00:21:24.450, Speaker B: Love that. So I've got to ask you, and I understand that it's not your thing to comment on, probably. And so that's fine. But a lot of the world, I mean, I wouldn't say it's the world's biggest movement, but there's the free Ross movement. I mean, I think obviously the most hardcore libertarians think that his sentencing is too long. I don't know what it is. It's what, multiple life sentences or something, though.
00:21:24.482 - 00:21:27.050, Speaker E: Two life sentences plus 40 years, which.
00:21:27.242 - 00:21:33.432, Speaker B: Is intellectually, just the fact that the government does that is kind of funny because it's like, I mean, you know, one life sentence would clearly suffice.
00:21:33.488 - 00:21:33.776, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:33.840 - 00:21:34.992, Speaker E: It's more than El Chapo.
00:21:35.088 - 00:21:39.696, Speaker B: Yeah, well, that's the thing. I mean, is it fair? Like, I mean, we know he did bad stuff.
00:21:39.760 - 00:21:40.008, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:40.056 - 00:21:45.888, Speaker B: And I'll ask you about the allegations that he had paid for assassinations.
00:21:45.936 - 00:21:46.600, Speaker C: Sure.
00:21:46.792 - 00:21:48.084, Speaker B: But, like, is it fair?
00:21:48.544 - 00:21:49.136, Speaker E: I really don't.
00:21:49.160 - 00:21:49.368, Speaker C: Public.
00:21:49.416 - 00:21:55.208, Speaker E: I have a public opinion. I have an opinion. I publicly don't share that. You know, the three branches of the government, you know.
00:21:55.296 - 00:21:55.472, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:55.488 - 00:21:57.248, Speaker B: It wasn't the FBI that imposed the sentence.
00:21:57.296 - 00:21:57.432, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:57.448 - 00:21:58.688, Speaker B: It's the judge, it's the court.
00:21:58.736 - 00:22:04.248, Speaker E: It's the judicial side. You know, we were just executing the laws the legislative branch put in place.
00:22:04.336 - 00:22:16.240, Speaker B: I think one of the reasons. I totally get that. I think one of the reasons in that, to the extent there's not a huge public outcry, is, like, you get the movie that recently came out. It's a relatively entertaining movie.
00:22:16.272 - 00:22:25.384, Speaker E: I mean, it wasn't part of the project. It was nice to see a guy with my name, but he kind of portrayed an asshole. And my partners will tell me that I am that asshole.
00:22:25.424 - 00:22:26.804, Speaker C: So it's. All right.
00:22:27.514 - 00:22:37.026, Speaker B: Is the idea that he ordered assassinations, it wasn't just that he was doing a libertarian open market, which, of course, was immediately used for drugs, which is bad. It's crime.
00:22:37.090 - 00:22:37.290, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:37.322 - 00:22:43.418, Speaker B: I mean, there's no doubt about that. But ordering people to be murdered, that's clearly evil.
00:22:43.506 - 00:22:43.778, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:43.826 - 00:22:45.002, Speaker B: Like, absolutely.
00:22:45.138 - 00:22:45.586, Speaker C: Did he.
00:22:45.610 - 00:22:48.354, Speaker B: I mean. Cause the feds never actually brought those charges against him.
00:22:48.434 - 00:22:48.690, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:48.722 - 00:22:57.654, Speaker E: So, I mean, one thing, you know, Ross made a lot of mistakes in configuring things and all that. And to include all the backups of the Silk Road, we're going to a server in Philadelphia. Right.
00:22:58.564 - 00:23:02.276, Speaker B: That was so they. They could reconstitute it if it was taken down. Right, I guess.
00:23:02.340 - 00:23:05.164, Speaker E: But why you put it in us infrastructure, I don't really understand that.
00:23:05.204 - 00:23:06.300, Speaker B: At least put it on a thumb drive.
00:23:06.372 - 00:23:06.916, Speaker C: Yeah. Put it.
00:23:06.940 - 00:23:08.024, Speaker E: Put in a foreign country.
00:23:09.724 - 00:23:10.544, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:10.924 - 00:23:17.660, Speaker E: But he also had. Because we got that laptop and we got it open. Didn't close it. I mean, he. He was the only person with a password to that. He opened it and was running.
00:23:17.692 - 00:23:17.836, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:17.860 - 00:23:22.348, Speaker E: Fingers were on it when he arrested him. There was a sort of a diary on there.
00:23:22.396 - 00:23:25.894, Speaker B: There was messages and stuff that proved this in your. In your guys mind.
00:23:26.014 - 00:23:46.326, Speaker E: Well, there were messages on the Silk Road server in Iceland, and there were also his diary where he was the only person had access to the account, kept good track of it. You know, I sent, you know, blah, blah, blah. This much crypto for this, you know, and it really showed, like, the arc of the way his mindset went. You know, the first murder he paid for was. Was very difficult. That was for him.
00:23:46.350 - 00:23:47.158, Speaker B: You mean, you can tell.
00:23:47.206 - 00:23:47.534, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:47.614 - 00:24:07.650, Speaker E: You know, what should I do? What should I do? And that was the one that Carl force and Sean Bridges were part of. Those were the agents that were arrested, part of the Baltimore investigation. But by time, the last one there was the hitman. The quote, unquote hitman came to him and said, we're going to. I have to go in there. But he has three roommates, and he's like, we'll just kill them all.
00:24:07.802 - 00:24:08.226, Speaker C: Wow.
00:24:08.290 - 00:24:10.534, Speaker E: So his mindset changed over time.
00:24:11.114 - 00:24:21.388, Speaker B: Fascinating. Let's talk about bitcoin and crime in general, because the Silk Road. And it obviously was used to a great extent at. In the Silk Road. We know this.
00:24:21.436 - 00:24:21.596, Speaker C: Right?
00:24:21.620 - 00:24:22.324, Speaker B: I mean, it was.
00:24:22.444 - 00:24:24.788, Speaker E: It was the only. That's how they did everything.
00:24:24.836 - 00:24:41.044, Speaker B: And it wasn't all crypto, but there weren't really other cryptos back then. It was bitcoin specifically, but, you know, is bitcoin. As a federal investigator, when you do money laundering investigations, you've got to. There isn't a central ledger, really, for money, to be honest.
00:24:41.084 - 00:24:41.308, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:41.356 - 00:24:49.144, Speaker B: Every bank kind of like, deals with their counterparty bank when money is moved. And if I'm a bank that trusts your bank, like, there is no, like, show me five hops back.
00:24:49.224 - 00:24:49.560, Speaker C: Right?
00:24:49.632 - 00:25:03.024, Speaker B: It's sort of like, well, it came from a legit bank. I'm a legit bank. So it's clean for now. We have some for benefit information that we also log. And if there's a, you know, a red flag, banks and financial institutions file a suspicious activity report with Fincen.
00:25:03.064 - 00:25:03.240, Speaker C: Right?
00:25:03.272 - 00:25:03.536, Speaker B: There's.
00:25:03.600 - 00:25:03.936, Speaker C: So there's.
00:25:03.960 - 00:25:10.488, Speaker B: There's reporting to look at, but it's. You can't just like, it's not as easy as pushing a button and seizing money in our current banking system.
00:25:10.536 - 00:25:10.720, Speaker C: Right?
00:25:10.752 - 00:25:15.632, Speaker B: Like, you have to send a bunch of letters, and if it goes to a foreign bank, it gets hard all of a sudden.
00:25:15.688 - 00:25:15.880, Speaker C: Right?
00:25:15.912 - 00:25:21.444, Speaker B: Like, compare that to investigating money laundering on the blockchain.
00:25:21.744 - 00:25:52.198, Speaker E: So now investigating bank money moving through, it's a series of subpoenas, and you gotta wait for them all to come back and put the pieces all together. You know, when we were doing blockchain analysis, you know, we didn't have any chain analysis or any of those tools, no software. There's nothing we could do. So again, this Matt Edmond invented his own tools in order to do all this stuff. And he was the key to season all the Silk road stuff. And so we didn't know how to do it. And he came up with a way, and it was easy.
00:25:52.198 - 00:25:57.654, Speaker E: We could see the whole picture. You could see money in, money out, everything was there, no subpoenas needed.
00:25:57.814 - 00:26:01.634, Speaker B: So in some ways, if you have the tools or if you build them.
00:26:02.014 - 00:26:07.222, Speaker E: Easier, better, easier, you can see a lot more. I mean, there's still speculation, right.
00:26:07.238 - 00:26:11.622, Speaker B: You don't know who each recipient necessarily is, but you've got a map of the money flow.
00:26:11.718 - 00:26:12.574, Speaker C: Right? Yeah.
00:26:12.614 - 00:26:16.654, Speaker E: If it goes into an exchange, it kind of gets into a mixer, you know, subpoena.
00:26:16.734 - 00:26:17.014, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:17.054 - 00:26:22.926, Speaker E: You have to sort of, kind of make some guesses there, but a lot faster. A lot faster than traditional bank investigations.
00:26:22.990 - 00:26:39.866, Speaker B: Yeah, very interesting. I just. I bring this up because following the Silk road and that whole era, there was a whole bunch of people that got interested in blockchain. They said, well, blockchain, not bitcoin, because, like, bitcoin could be for criminals. It certainly was used by criminals. Um, but one of the things I tell them is that, well, it's.
00:26:39.890 - 00:26:40.234, Speaker C: It's.
00:26:40.314 - 00:26:45.866, Speaker B: Bitcoin's pretty much the most traceable money ever created. So. Yeah, I mean, it's pseudonymous.
00:26:45.970 - 00:26:46.186, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:46.210 - 00:26:55.914, Speaker B: It's not like my name's on the blockchain, but if you can get that information otherwise, else wise in your investigation, it can be highly traceable. It's really not great for criminals.
00:26:55.954 - 00:26:56.130, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:56.162 - 00:26:56.974, Speaker B: I mean, it's.
00:26:57.674 - 00:27:12.552, Speaker E: Yeah. You people get tripped up all the time with KYC information. You know, they make one, you know. You know, there's a thing called fruit of the poisonous tree. So one bitcoin goes into an account. All of those then are labeled as bad. If that one bitcoin was bad, it.
00:27:12.568 - 00:27:14.336, Speaker B: Gives the investigator someone to ask.
00:27:14.400 - 00:27:15.008, Speaker E: Right, exactly.
00:27:15.056 - 00:27:24.320, Speaker B: This account, we know who that one is, so we'll go ask them. Just kind of an interesting concept. It's sort of rethinking how AML investigations are.
00:27:24.352 - 00:27:24.472, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:24.488 - 00:27:43.288, Speaker B: I mean, it's a whole new type of money, but it's not totally contrary to it. Might be hard. You might know that the money is tainted and be unable to seize it, which isn't really the same as in the traditional bank world, right. Where if you find the dirty money and it's in an institution under the american jurisdiction, you're gonna be able to get that money.
00:27:43.336 - 00:27:43.904, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:44.064 - 00:27:49.752, Speaker B: This could be like, well, we see it going to a foreign terrorist, but we aren't. We don't have the keys to the. We can't actually get the coins.
00:27:49.808 - 00:27:49.976, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:50.000 - 00:27:52.656, Speaker B: So that, is that the main difference? I mean.
00:27:52.720 - 00:27:53.832, Speaker E: Yeah, that's probably the main difference.
00:27:53.888 - 00:27:55.776, Speaker B: More traceable, less seizable.
00:27:55.920 - 00:27:56.200, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:56.232 - 00:28:01.848, Speaker E: I mean, you'd have to create a hard fork if you really wanted to go over there and, you know, I don't think has that much reach.
00:28:01.936 - 00:28:02.440, Speaker C: Yeah. They don't.
00:28:02.472 - 00:28:13.398, Speaker B: They don't have enough sway over the bitcoiners to actually get them to fork out there. Coins, ransomware. Short, big crypto crime topic.
00:28:13.526 - 00:28:13.838, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:13.886 - 00:28:18.494, Speaker B: Obviously. I mean, first of all, how big a problem is ransomware? Is it a huge problem? I hear that it's huge.
00:28:18.574 - 00:28:19.150, Speaker E: Hundreds of billion.
00:28:19.182 - 00:28:20.382, Speaker B: I haven't been ransomware.
00:28:20.438 - 00:28:21.102, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:21.278 - 00:28:31.478, Speaker B: Hundreds of billions of dollars every year earned by criminals or whatever, either damaged or. I see not a hundred billion in ransoms paid. But, yeah.
00:28:31.526 - 00:28:43.600, Speaker E: So we've had encryption for what, 75 years, 100 years, even a long time for that. But really it was the rise of crypto, that payment option. People weren't locking up your data and saying, put the duffel bag of cash.
00:28:43.792 - 00:28:47.336, Speaker B: They weren't saying, send an ach or a fed wire to this bank account.
00:28:47.400 - 00:29:08.632, Speaker E: Too traceable and all that. So really it was crypto came along that made the ransomware go. And ransomware is getting a little bit better where people are realizing how to mitigate it. If you have really good backups, you get ransomware. You can just restore those backups. Or if you're very good at segmenting your networks and not. And allow the ransomware to go from, you know, machine to machine to machine, you know, very good.
00:29:08.728 - 00:29:13.056, Speaker B: There's a name in cybersecurity for this new theory of what? Like, zero conf, what's it called?
00:29:13.080 - 00:29:13.576, Speaker E: Zero trust.
00:29:13.640 - 00:29:19.128, Speaker B: Zero trust. Design your network where basically not a single employee, like, even if they're hacked, they have nothing, basically.
00:29:19.216 - 00:29:20.296, Speaker C: Right. Yeah.
00:29:20.320 - 00:29:25.960, Speaker E: And they say, you and I are plugged into the same network. My computer doesn't trust your computer on anything.
00:29:26.032 - 00:29:26.480, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:26.592 - 00:29:33.840, Speaker E: It's kind of hard in the business world to have perfect zero trust, you know, because we're about sharing information and working collaboratively together.
00:29:33.952 - 00:29:34.264, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:34.304 - 00:29:48.466, Speaker E: So it makes it a little bit more difficult. But, you know, ransomware is now going on to move on to the extortion. So a lot of places. And you're getting your shit locked up through encryption, but they're also stealing it. And then they're saying, we're gonna publish it if you don't pay now.
00:29:48.490 - 00:29:48.834, Speaker B: Got it.
00:29:48.874 - 00:29:50.546, Speaker E: So that's really kind of where ransomware.
00:29:50.570 - 00:30:06.098, Speaker B: Is morphing into on the ransomware side, too. Again, before we move on, there's one interesting thing that I've heard, which is that part of the reason it's been so effective is that the most ransomware hackers, they do unencrypt or they don't publish the data if you pay.
00:30:06.226 - 00:30:06.658, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:06.746 - 00:30:17.154, Speaker B: They're actually like, I don't want to. I'm certainly not calling them ethical, but it's like there's sort of a pact where, like. And the reason that they will unlock it if you pay is because they need the next person to pay. And the next person.
00:30:17.274 - 00:30:18.178, Speaker E: Yeah, they're businessmen.
00:30:18.226 - 00:30:21.850, Speaker B: Yeah, they're businessmen. They're pretty fair about it. They're just, I mean, in that way.
00:30:21.922 - 00:30:22.082, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:22.098 - 00:30:24.562, Speaker E: And people negotiate with them. You know, say, we just can't afford.
00:30:24.618 - 00:30:27.842, Speaker B: This, or we'll give it to you now. Some now and some in a little bit or something.
00:30:27.938 - 00:30:28.146, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:28.170 - 00:30:46.290, Speaker E: There was a log recently released about one of the negotiations. And one of the interesting things I found is that they'll research regulators in your country and they said, well, you can pay us this, but the regulators are going to charge you four times as much as if we release this information because they know you're hacked. So why don't you just pay us the quarter and we'll keep this all quiet.
00:30:46.362 - 00:30:50.034, Speaker B: Wow. And then they do keep it quiet. Typically, yeah.
00:30:50.074 - 00:31:00.602, Speaker E: I mean, so you really should find the vulnerability, how they came into your network. I mean, it obviously could just be phishing, you know, as easy as that. But, you know, you're not going to want to leave that vulnerability wide open.
00:31:00.658 - 00:31:01.042, Speaker C: Totally.
00:31:01.098 - 00:31:06.934, Speaker E: And I'm not recommending paying it. I'm recommending having a very secure network and not allowing it into the system to begin with.
00:31:06.974 - 00:31:29.812, Speaker B: Well, and that's the thing too, right? A lot of the most, maybe most prominent, but I don't know, you probably know the landscape more, but victims of ransomware, it's like hospitals. Cause they run a super old operating system they haven't patched in ten years. Or even the colonial pipeline attack, I don't know. But I'm assuming just random infrastructure, manufacturing sector. They're not like computer wizards, right?
00:31:29.878 - 00:31:30.104, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:30.144 - 00:31:35.576, Speaker E: Towards networks. They can never go down. You know, like hospitals. You can't really shut them off and restart them.
00:31:35.640 - 00:31:36.040, Speaker C: That's true.
00:31:36.072 - 00:31:38.600, Speaker B: They right there. So they're likely to pay, like. Yeah, because they.
00:31:38.632 - 00:31:39.056, Speaker C: Cause it. Yeah.
00:31:39.080 - 00:31:44.664, Speaker B: It's not like we can have. No. From a coffee shop. You can survive without a computer for a couple of days.
00:31:44.704 - 00:31:45.112, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:45.208 - 00:31:46.592, Speaker B: Not if you're an infrastructure.
00:31:46.648 - 00:31:56.044, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly. So interesting. So and, you know, it's getting better. People are starting to realize what ransomware is. Companies are starting to protect, but, you know, we always can do better.
00:31:57.304 - 00:32:39.418, Speaker B: I want to ask you about another thing that's related. So some of the Silk Road coins, apparently, I believe maybe the first week of March of this year, were seen moving on chain, I believe about 10,000 bitcoins. And the media and I think pulling this info from some blockchain analysis people said that the coins were being sent to Coinbase. I was trying to understand why that might be right. Not only me, a lot of analysts were trying to understand what that means. Typically, when the US marshals have dispensed of bitcoin that they've seized, it's through an auction, or I guess there haven't been a lot many in a while. Any.
00:32:39.418 - 00:32:47.642, Speaker B: I'm willing to put forth my own two theories, if you prefer that way, and you can comment on them. But do you have any idea why they might send it to an exchange?
00:32:47.738 - 00:32:51.946, Speaker E: I don't know. It'd be speculation, but certainly to welcome to walk down that path with you.
00:32:52.010 - 00:32:52.370, Speaker B: Speculate.
00:32:52.402 - 00:32:53.602, Speaker E: I can tell you what I know.
00:32:53.738 - 00:32:54.546, Speaker B: Yeah, let's speculate.
00:32:54.570 - 00:32:55.050, Speaker C: I mean, what.
00:32:55.122 - 00:33:06.290, Speaker B: I mean, historically, the coins that you guys seized, a lot of them or some of them were auctioned, right? I mentioned that before, that Tim Draper famously bought some of them. Nice trade, but.
00:33:06.322 - 00:33:06.898, Speaker C: Yeah. Why?
00:33:06.986 - 00:33:10.034, Speaker B: I mean, are they not doing auctions anymore? I haven't seen one in a while.
00:33:10.154 - 00:33:16.518, Speaker E: I really don't know what the marshalls. I mean, they recently suffered a hack themselves. The Marshalls did? Yeah, in the last couple months.
00:33:16.566 - 00:33:31.830, Speaker B: Oh, wait, was this. There was the one, too, where they had seized a guy and his brother actually had. They didn't move the coins. There was that story, too, right? So his brother, like, then got arrested for. There was a story was like the sea. The feds just had bitcoin. They'd seize, like, pulled out from under them.
00:33:31.942 - 00:33:32.302, Speaker C: Well, it's.
00:33:32.318 - 00:33:38.190, Speaker B: Cause they just, like, you can't prove that no one else has the keys, and they didn't move them to keys, that they knew that.
00:33:38.262 - 00:33:39.934, Speaker E: Oh, they didn't move fast enough out of the wall.
00:33:39.974 - 00:33:43.896, Speaker B: And so the guy they had arrested's brother took the coins and, like, spent them.
00:33:44.040 - 00:33:44.272, Speaker C: All.
00:33:44.288 - 00:33:45.304, Speaker E: Right, I didn't hear about that.
00:33:45.384 - 00:33:45.552, Speaker C: So.
00:33:45.568 - 00:33:46.080, Speaker B: Not that hack.
00:33:46.112 - 00:33:46.568, Speaker E: Not that.
00:33:46.656 - 00:33:47.136, Speaker C: They, uh.
00:33:47.160 - 00:33:57.048, Speaker E: The Marshalls got hit with ransomware recently, and so, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't. When we worked with the marshalls, they. They were good about keeping them in cold storage.
00:33:57.136 - 00:33:57.520, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:57.592 - 00:34:03.600, Speaker B: Uh, and so you're saying, theoretically, uh, they might have to pay a ransom. That could be a reason that they moved coin.
00:34:03.712 - 00:34:06.456, Speaker E: I hadn't thought of that. I mean, uh, yeah, here's the other.
00:34:06.480 - 00:34:07.312, Speaker B: Ideas that I had there.
00:34:07.368 - 00:34:09.736, Speaker E: I doubt it would come out of those funds. It would come, you know, because those.
00:34:09.760 - 00:34:15.666, Speaker B: Well, that's what's weird, that those funds are, like, evidence, basically. Right. Or how do they think about seized coin or seized money?
00:34:15.730 - 00:34:15.930, Speaker C: Sure.
00:34:15.962 - 00:34:34.546, Speaker E: Once everything is adjudicated and the seizure order is signed and it then becomes government forfeiture, anything forfeited in a criminal investigation that way, like, a drug dealer is arrested in Lamborghini, it then goes to undercovers. So all that money funds federal undercover investigations.
00:34:34.650 - 00:34:34.986, Speaker C: I see.
00:34:35.010 - 00:34:45.042, Speaker B: That's smart. So it could be funding something undercover. Theoretically. I mean, I guess they would send it. If it was. If it was. They sent it to Coinbase to help wash it, basically.
00:34:45.098 - 00:34:45.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:45.770 - 00:34:51.242, Speaker E: I would think. I mean, so they're gonna. You know, hopefully, people, the marshals are good enough with Coinbase's help.
00:34:51.298 - 00:34:59.094, Speaker B: I mean, they're not gonna whitewash it. Mixer or whatever. Like, an illegal. Like, you're not gonna see, like, funds from a us government wallet go into an illegal tumbler.
00:34:59.594 - 00:35:01.894, Speaker E: Not in the first hop, I wouldn't suppose.
00:35:02.594 - 00:35:07.146, Speaker B: The other weird ideas I had, the two main ones, it was sort of something like this. Funding something undercover.
00:35:07.210 - 00:35:07.894, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:35:08.074 - 00:35:24.254, Speaker B: The other one is even stranger. I'll mention it just for the audience, although I don't think either of us really have any way of knowing if this is true. But the government is currently under special measures. They're funding the government by the Treasury Department, moving money around. Currently, we are. Cause we're out. They're out of money.
00:35:24.334 - 00:35:24.550, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:24.582 - 00:35:46.352, Speaker B: And there's a debt limit. This goes into this debt limit fight in Congress, which they have every couple of years. They've never failed to raise the debt limit, but that, apparently, they don't have to do, actually, until sometime this summer. Until then, I don't know, Uncle Sam can just sort of, like, move some money around and get it paid. What if the US marshal said, hey, treasury, we're out of money? And they were just like, just sell some of that bitcoin.
00:35:46.528 - 00:35:52.488, Speaker E: I mean, I think you'd have to see the Congress or an executive order that says that money can be used for that sort of thing.
00:35:52.536 - 00:35:53.520, Speaker B: Cause it normally can't be.
00:35:53.552 - 00:35:58.200, Speaker E: It normally can't. It can only go to fund undercover law enforcement operations.
00:35:58.352 - 00:35:59.112, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:35:59.248 - 00:36:11.094, Speaker E: Maybe somebody will. Now, one of your listeners will find some sort of document where there was an executive order that says it could be used that way, but I doubt it. I more think it's going to be used in some sort of undercover operation.
00:36:11.174 - 00:36:35.668, Speaker B: So as someone who's obviously worked in federal law enforcement knows the cybersecurity landscape and also some of the crypto issues, what does the US government, what tools does the US government want to make this better? Like why, or let me say it a different way, why is the US government so notably antagonistic against the crypto world when other jurisdictions are really moving in the other direction?
00:36:35.836 - 00:36:37.748, Speaker E: So, again, just speculation on my side.
00:36:37.796 - 00:36:38.284, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:38.404 - 00:36:54.988, Speaker E: But I think it's two parts. It's a little bit of ignorance where, you know, it's scary. I don't know what it is. For computer crimes, we still use telephone laws in order to fight those crimes. So if I want to get like a. It's called a PRTT. You know, if I want to get that information, that's a telephone registry.
00:36:54.988 - 00:37:23.892, Speaker E: If I want to get a t three, I use telephone laws to get a, you know, wiretap on a computer. Outdated laws, outdated laws that aren't. It's not even keeping up with the computers. But think how long till crypto? You know, we see our representatives on tv every day. I mean, I don't think a lot of them would understand crypto if tested. But in two, you know, we talked about it, you know, sports gambling took a very long time in order to become legal. And what caused it to become legal? They figured out a way of taxing it.
00:37:23.948 - 00:37:24.900, Speaker B: So they want their peace.
00:37:25.012 - 00:37:26.028, Speaker E: Of course they want their peace.
00:37:26.076 - 00:37:26.308, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:26.356 - 00:37:27.636, Speaker B: That's how we fund the government.
00:37:27.740 - 00:37:34.604, Speaker E: Exactly. So, you know, that's a lot of unregulated money moving back and forth, you know, so I would suspect they want their piece.
00:37:34.684 - 00:37:40.732, Speaker B: So. And when we think about the. Another thing I want to ask about. So along similar lines.
00:37:40.788 - 00:37:41.004, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:41.044 - 00:37:45.644, Speaker B: The government has had a very long, antagonistic relationship with open cryptography.
00:37:45.684 - 00:37:45.860, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:45.892 - 00:38:04.352, Speaker B: There's Phil Zimmerman and PGP where briefly, they charged him criminally. Then they tried. Then they were going to sue him. They thought that the government was treating cryptography as a munition. They wanted to sue. They sued briefly, Phil Zimmerman under the Arms Export Control act.
00:38:04.488 - 00:38:04.760, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:04.792 - 00:38:41.884, Speaker B: That sharing that cryptography is a military technology and sharing it with foreign adversaries is treason basically, was the argument. Of course, he didn't specifically share it with foreign adversaries. He released it publicly for everyone. And since then. And then there was the clipper chip in the nineties from the Clinton administration. There's the San Bernardino iPhone, right where they. We know, like, the government has been hostile against encrypted messaging for a long time, I'm sure continues to be not only the US government, basically all governments, and then you use that tech to build money and it's like, that's a really big thumb in the eye.
00:38:42.044 - 00:38:42.332, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:42.348 - 00:38:49.604, Speaker E: The Russians just outlawed ten or twelve different communications that use encryption. Weirdly. Signal wasn't on that one.
00:38:49.764 - 00:38:50.468, Speaker B: That is weird.
00:38:50.516 - 00:38:55.204, Speaker E: Yeah, we covered that in an episode of Hacker and the fed a couple of weeks ago. So I recommend to listen to that.
00:38:55.244 - 00:39:00.916, Speaker B: Yeah, check that podcast out, by the way, I mentioned of the top hacker and the Fed, Chris's podcast with Hector.
00:39:00.940 - 00:39:10.500, Speaker E: Montzegor, guy I arrested, it was sabu from anonymous. So there's not many podcasts out there where the one co host arrested the other one. So facing 125 years for what he did.
00:39:10.532 - 00:39:10.788, Speaker C: Wow.
00:39:10.836 - 00:39:12.664, Speaker E: But we worked that off. So it was good.
00:39:13.444 - 00:39:56.372, Speaker B: So do you think that the government, like, how does this. I don't know, how does this end? But, like, crypto or. And encryption, encrypted messaging, I think in my mind, as far as I consider the government's posture on the law enforcement side of the government's posture on this, it's more about the, it's similar, the encrypted messaging versus the encrypted money, quote, unquote. Do they, does it, do they call for new laws? I mean, you got the. Who's the head of the FBI? Chris Ray. Now, I wouldn't say he's been the most, like, antagonistic, but James Comey was quite, had given many speeches about encrypted messaging. President Barack Obama said, we don't want every, we don't want a swiss bank account in everyone's pocket talking about your phone.
00:39:56.372 - 00:40:13.344, Speaker B: He was talking about encrypted messaging. But bitcoin is kind of like that. How does this end? Do you think the fed's like, I mean, does this go on forever? Is there going to be, are we destined now that this cryptography is open in public, to have a perpetual tension between the public's use of it and the government's need to access it?
00:40:13.424 - 00:40:35.976, Speaker E: I hope so. I hope that the government never requires us to give up our passwords. In some countries, it's a crime if you get arrested and don't give your password, that it's another charge. I really hope we don't go that way. I'm a privacy guy. I'm a technologist. I want to see that things move forward and to retard that technology moving forward, it would be scary to me.
00:40:36.040 - 00:40:36.576, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:36.720 - 00:40:41.284, Speaker B: You believe that's, like, a human right, that, like, humanity deserves to have private privacy?
00:40:42.544 - 00:40:49.424, Speaker E: I don't know if I'm gonna go that far, but I think, as Americans, we deserve, you know, it's part of our constitution to be able to have privacy.
00:40:49.504 - 00:41:13.836, Speaker B: I mean, Ben Franklin said that it would be worse to put that it would be better to let one bad guy go free than to have, you know, a bunch of innocent people be detained. At the time, Vice President Dick Cheney said, literally once gave a quote that's literally the opposite of that, that we were fine with having. Capturing up a bunch of innocents to get the bad guy. Doesn't it feel sort of like that.
00:41:13.900 - 00:41:31.138, Speaker E: Until you're the innocent? I mean, people can get behind that until you or your family members the innocent. So, you know, I can give you the emotional pull. Like, I worked a case where there were parents selling their children on the Internet. They were. They were renting them out. So if you wanted to rent a child for a few hours, you could do it. And they use cryptocurrency in order to pay for that.
00:41:31.138 - 00:41:40.042, Speaker E: You know, that's, you know, but I can't think of anything worse, you know, than that. So, you know, do we want to end cryptocurrency? Cause that is a problem. So that's the thing.
00:41:40.058 - 00:41:42.954, Speaker B: And then you got all this. This is exactly what I'm getting at. Same thing with messaging.
00:41:42.994 - 00:41:43.122, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:43.138 - 00:41:46.154, Speaker B: If you got a bunch of terrorists that are able to use private messaging, that's.
00:41:46.194 - 00:41:46.322, Speaker C: We.
00:41:46.338 - 00:41:52.434, Speaker B: I think we all agree that's bad, but the positive use cases of it are pretty dramatic as well, because bad.
00:41:52.474 - 00:41:55.418, Speaker E: Guys are using something, some sort of technology, I shouldn't be able to.
00:41:55.466 - 00:41:55.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:55.650 - 00:41:58.436, Speaker B: Bad guy drove a car. Not banning cars, you know?
00:41:58.500 - 00:42:05.700, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. I mean, not to get too political, but they kind of go in that way with gun control, and bad guys use guns, so nobody can use guns.
00:42:05.732 - 00:42:06.164, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:06.284 - 00:42:06.900, Speaker E: So.
00:42:07.052 - 00:42:17.884, Speaker B: So you think they'll. They'll continue to make that argument, though. And it's up to the, you know, the legal, law abiding public that also still wants these tools to, you know, constantly fight back.
00:42:17.924 - 00:42:18.140, Speaker C: That's.
00:42:18.172 - 00:42:19.676, Speaker B: That's the world we're in.
00:42:19.820 - 00:42:23.864, Speaker E: Laws are made by people that we vote into, into power. So it comes down to your vote.
00:42:24.884 - 00:42:46.220, Speaker B: This has been a great conversation, Chris, thank you so much for coming. What's on your radar in the cybersecurity and, I don't know, in crypto space in the next year? I don't know any sort of insight into where you think the space is going or for your business. Cybersecurity firm. What's top of mind for you right now, Hector?
00:42:46.252 - 00:43:08.424, Speaker E: On the podcast the other day, we talked about what's going to happen in 2023. He says the insider threat. So I can't take that one. I think ransomware is going to continue to go. There's a lot of low hanging fruit and it's going to go out there in the crypto space. There was a lot of mom and pops that bought into crypto and sort of burnt on it these days and trying to get out of it. But I think crypto is going to just get stronger.
00:43:08.424 - 00:43:20.424, Speaker E: I think there's going to be this poll we talk about between the government and people with privacy for encryption and for cryptocurrency. And I hope that pull continues because I don't want to see the government win this one.
