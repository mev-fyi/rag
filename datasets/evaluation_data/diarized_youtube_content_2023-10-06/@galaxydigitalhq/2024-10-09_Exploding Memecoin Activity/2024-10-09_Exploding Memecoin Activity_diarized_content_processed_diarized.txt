00:00:00.280 - 00:00:30.027, Speaker A: The hypothesis was like, you know, there's some data here. Culture is going to start adopting this thing. And then what came from that? I did not expect what I. What I saw happen with, like, dog with hat. And then Q1 of this year, this absolute explosion of meme coin activity to me, validated my assumption that Solana has product market fit for retail, salon has product market fit for, you know, pop culture. And people can, like, opine or, or. Or bitch and moan about whether meme coins are good or bad.
