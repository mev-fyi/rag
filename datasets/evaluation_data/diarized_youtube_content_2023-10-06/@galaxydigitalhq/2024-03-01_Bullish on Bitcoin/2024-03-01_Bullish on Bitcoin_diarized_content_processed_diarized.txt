00:00:00.160 - 00:00:37.120, Speaker A: But I think you really have to think about bitcoin in isolation. And there's a whole investor base that wasn't able to get access before. That is just getting access. Markets move at the margin, and if there are going to be more marginal buyers than sellers on a consistent basis for bitcoin, the price needs to go a lot higher, and that's kind of where we're at. And you could talk to people on either end of the monetary policy spectrum, and I don't think it would sway you on, you know, where bitcoin prices are headed. Like, I've, I've talked to macro guys that are super hawkish and super dovish, but most of them are pretty bullish bitcoin, and they wish they had more. Yep.
