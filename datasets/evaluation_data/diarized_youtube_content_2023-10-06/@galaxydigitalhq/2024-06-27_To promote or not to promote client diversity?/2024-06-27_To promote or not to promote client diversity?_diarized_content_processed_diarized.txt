00:00:00.160 - 00:00:06.326, Speaker A: Proof of stake is an inherently centralizing force. And if we don't address that, it doesn't matter how many execution clients there are.
00:00:06.398 - 00:00:25.532, Speaker B: That is a hot take, because what if that one client, if we don't promote client diversity, what happens if there's a bug in geth? What happens if there's a catastrophic bug in that one majority client? Don't you want a lot of diversity so that if everybody has equally one third share, then if we lose a third of the network, we'll be fine?
00:00:25.726 - 00:00:55.480, Speaker A: I don't think anybody's fine. If we lose a third of the network, I don't think the third is happy. I don't think the two thirds are happy, and I think that everybody is having a bad day and spending a lot of money fixing that. Having more clients makes it more likely that that happens. If you have three equal clients, then you have three times as many chances to have a bug that splits off a third of the network. If you have one client, you have a smaller chance of a bug that splits off more of the network.
