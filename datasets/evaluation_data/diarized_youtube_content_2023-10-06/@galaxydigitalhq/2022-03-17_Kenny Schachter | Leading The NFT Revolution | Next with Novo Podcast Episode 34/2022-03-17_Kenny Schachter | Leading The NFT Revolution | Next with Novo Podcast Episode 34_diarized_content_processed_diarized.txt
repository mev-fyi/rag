00:00:01.120 - 00:00:19.634, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. Welcome, everybody. It's yet another episode of next with Novo. And I'm here with the great Kenny Schachner. I literally met Kenny when I had hair. That's how long ago it was.
00:00:19.634 - 00:00:23.374, Speaker A: He hasn't changed a bit. He's actually better looking than he used to be.
00:00:23.494 - 00:00:24.982, Speaker B: Bless you. Okay. Could leave now.
00:00:25.038 - 00:00:40.624, Speaker A: He can leave now. So, Kenny, first of all, welcome. Kenny is an art man, but he's now become an NFT aficionado, an expert. But we're gonna first start. Tell us a little bit about yourself. Grew up where. How'd you get here?
00:00:41.724 - 00:00:42.740, Speaker B: To Grand street.
00:00:42.852 - 00:00:44.436, Speaker A: To Grand street. You grew up where?
00:00:44.540 - 00:01:19.904, Speaker B: I grew up in Long island in the suburbs. And I was overweight and I had a speech impediment until I was around 15. So I had a very isolated childhood that wasn't the best, but contributed to making me the horror I am today and infused me with this enthusiasm and passion for the things that drive me. So I don't complain about anything that's happened, good or bad, but we're defined by our previous experiences. So I studied philosophy and political science, and I just had no. All I knew is what I didn't want to do. I didn't want the routine of.
00:01:19.904 - 00:01:35.180, Speaker B: Of a job that would repeat itself ad infinitum. I didn't want to spend my life looking forward to something other than what it was I loved. But I had no idea. So I went to. I studied with philosophy. I wasn't going to teach high school. That would have been a terror for all the kids.
00:01:35.180 - 00:02:00.694, Speaker B: So I, although I've been teaching now for 30 years now, art and economics and NFT ism at NYU and University of Zurich. Studied philosophy, went to law school. And I feel the same way about lawyers as most people do. It was never my interest to pursue that area. So three quarters into the first year, I quit going to school and I started working. I told everyone, my employers and my family, that I was in night school. There was no night school.
00:02:00.694 - 00:02:10.694, Speaker B: And not that I would have had better results if I was sitting through class, but I chose not to. Worked in the floor of the stock exchange I was casting around for. I just knew what I.
00:02:10.734 - 00:02:10.862, Speaker A: Like.
00:02:10.878 - 00:02:35.424, Speaker B: I said, I defined my whole mentality in the negative, in the sense that I was just really. I wanted to not capitulate and not compromise and find something that. I mean, even like Warren Buffett said, like, find what you would do for free. That's the path to success. And I love my work so much. Like, the thought of like a holiday for two weeks on the beach, you know, without a great wireless. I'd rather, you know, I wouldn't rather not.
00:02:35.424 - 00:03:00.070, Speaker B: So anyway, I did. So I worked in the fashion business. You wouldn't know it. Thankfully, this is a podcast, so you can't see my video, vintage polyester track pants. And I did a load of different things. And until I stumbled into Andy Warhol's estate sale. And it's funny because I just gave a talk at Sotheby's before the kind of disastrous crypto punk auction non event last week.
00:03:00.070 - 00:03:21.206, Speaker B: I was on stage beforehand, and then all the punks blamed me for the fact that the ceilings. I was trolled for a good 24 hours for a change. Now we have trolls in the art world, trolls in the tech world. But anyway, so, yeah, I just sort of. I just found. I just waited. So I went to Sotheby's, and I was saying, like, I didn't like Warhol when I first saw it.
00:03:21.206 - 00:03:56.592, Speaker B: I thought it was mechanical, clinical, just some guy or his assistants pulling silk screens. And it wasn't very physical or, you know, tactile process. And I said the same thing when I first saw the punks. I'm like, are you fucking joking? Like, that's the sensation of nfts. And then I, of course, I realized, like, first of all, I've succumbed myself and created a 10,000 PFP project called Crypto Mutz. But none of this would have existed had they not created a new cultural output of, like, it's in between fine art or collectibles. It's really something unto itself.
00:03:56.592 - 00:04:11.832, Speaker B: It will be defined throughout history as many different things. It gives me chills just to think about it. But those guys never identified as artists. They were just doing their thing, which is beautiful. And that's what I do. So I just threw there. I fell into art, started making art 30 years ago.
00:04:11.832 - 00:04:27.112, Speaker B: I was making digital videos 30 years ago, years ago, giant computer prints, all of these things. And I just. For me, I'm not. I can't get my phone to work or my printer to print. But I love technology because for me, technology is culture. It's life. It's our life.
00:04:27.112 - 00:04:31.416, Speaker B: We're so defined by the avenues that culture takes us.
00:04:31.480 - 00:04:44.524, Speaker A: So you see the Warhol thing, you decide you're going to be both an artist and you became an art collector, an art connoisseur, an art writer. How did that journey happen?
00:04:44.684 - 00:05:03.228, Speaker B: Well, I never. I was so naive. I call myself idiot idiot. Sivan. Because I'm not the brightest bull, but I love my work, so I'm dedicated. And that's a great lesson for people like, you know, just persevere and never take no for an answer because no one is ever. It's so hard to even find encouragement from people.
00:05:03.228 - 00:05:24.162, Speaker B: And that's why I love to teach and help inspire people, because there's so few people. I mean, it gives me so much joy and satisfaction. But anyway, as soon as I found out, I went to the Warhol sale. Sotheby was gearing up for a contemporary art sale. They just had a sale today. They sold to Renee Magritte for 70, $80 million today. And they sold at Christie's world of women NFT.
00:05:24.162 - 00:05:45.410, Speaker B: And they sold the lost, what's it called? The lost nudes of another NFT in the evening sales of auctions in London for a million dollars. So it's an extraordinary time we're in. And it's really to see so much change underfoot in such a dense period. I mean, I always say it's like dog years. One year in tech is ten years in real life.
00:05:45.522 - 00:05:48.298, Speaker A: That's the way I want to stay in the early days. Your first.
00:05:48.346 - 00:06:02.134, Speaker B: Your first. So, I mean, I. Okay, so I had no idea that you could own art, that you could collect art. I was so stupid. I thought, like, artist makes art, art goes to museum, end of equation. I went to museums when I was in university. Shitty.
00:06:02.134 - 00:06:13.804, Speaker B: Not a great academic school. I wasn't terribly academic minded. Went to museums to procrastinate. That was. Never went to galleries. Didn't know galleries existed. So when I saw Sotheby's, they were gearing up for an auction.
00:06:13.804 - 00:06:38.516, Speaker B: It was like, it was epiphany, like I was blown away. And then I saw an ad in the New York Times for an exhibition of some german art. So I taught myself. I studied german philosophy and I started to teach myself, or I somehow became aware of german art through the museum. I went to rocked up at JP Morgan and asked them for a loan to buy some art. The guy turned his head sideways like a schnauzer and he thought I was mad. Of course he said no, flat out.
00:06:38.516 - 00:06:57.658, Speaker B: I had the manager of the law firm I was working at part time. I miraculously passed the bar exam. Lawyer called the bank, I got my money and then I was like dealer to dealer dealer, so I couldn't sell drugs to a drug addict. But I love art and I love to possess it, own it. What was your first work on paper?
00:06:57.756 - 00:06:58.206, Speaker A: Wow.
00:06:58.310 - 00:07:16.958, Speaker B: Yeah. Idiot savant. You started well, and then I started dealing. See, so I became a dealer and a curator. Not because, I mean, I'm not a very good dealer, but it was the only way for me to position myself to have a life within the arts. No one would take me seriously as a curator. No one would take me seriously as an artist.
00:07:16.958 - 00:07:20.446, Speaker B: They still don't, unfortunately, but I'm through one day.
00:07:20.550 - 00:07:21.558, Speaker A: We all have our moment.
00:07:21.606 - 00:07:43.186, Speaker B: I tell you, it's happened last year through NFTs have redefined not only my life, but so many other people's lives. And you hear so much crap. I'm going off piece. Yes, but so much negativity in the world about crypto, about nfTs, about. Everyone's always looking at the negative things. There's nothing wrong with crypto. It's people that are fucked up.
00:07:43.186 - 00:07:49.974, Speaker B: There's a bell's curve of integrity and morality. We're the problem. There's nothing wrong with blockchain. Blockchain is extraordinary.
00:07:50.834 - 00:08:03.844, Speaker A: You're appreciatively converted here. No doubt about that. No doubt about it. So you started buying and selling and collecting. What's your favorite piece in your first ten years that you bought? You still have it? Are you flipping all the time?
00:08:03.924 - 00:08:22.978, Speaker B: I don't flip all the time. I mean, three warehouses will attest to that. Every year I have a sale at Sotheby's called the hoarder sale. It's not like taking the piss out of myself out of art collectors. I mean, we're like squirrels. It's a human characteristic to like. People say, why do you want to own a jpeg? Anyone could copy it.
00:08:22.978 - 00:08:54.234, Speaker B: Anyone could copy a photograph by Ansel Adams or Cindy Sherman or Richard Prince. Everything is. I could send a jpeg of a van gogh to China and get a perfect rendition of it on oil on canvas. People are like squirrels. They like to squirrel it away and collect art. So I always say, like, you know, in a way, I just like to be surrounded by works. So I don't get particularly, in a way I call myself, like a materialistic but aesthetic.
00:08:54.234 - 00:08:59.714, Speaker B: So I don't get stuck on things, per se, as long as I'm surrounded aplenty by them.
00:08:59.834 - 00:09:05.602, Speaker A: Got it, got it, got it. You know, I've been in a couple of your houses and you got a lot of art. I love art.
00:09:05.618 - 00:09:26.360, Speaker B: I mean, it's been since it came off the wall of the cave in ancient times. It's been coveted by people, and it's incredible. Like, I remember the recession in America from 1990 to 1995, six. It was extraordinary. And like, artists came out of the woodwork and did fantastic projects. 2008, the so called, like, great recession. Two years later, the art market was.
00:09:26.392 - 00:09:27.752, Speaker A: On all cylinders, on fire.
00:09:27.848 - 00:09:36.844, Speaker B: It's so resilient, that distinguishes us as a species, this desire to express ourselves and communicate. And that's, for me, what art is all about.
00:09:37.304 - 00:10:09.744, Speaker A: I called the top of the art market a few times, and then I was like, okay, I have to admit, I was just dead wrong. I'm now buying, and I started buying art, and now I love it as well. I was very late to the party, I have to admit, but I was early to the NFT world. Partly I was talking about NFTs in 2013 and 2014, in theory, not in practice, that I was like, hey, we have this new technology that is about digital scarcity. And if you have digital scarcity, artists will actually have the courage to use their talents to produce digitally, because people will know it's theirs.
00:10:09.824 - 00:10:11.792, Speaker B: Amazing. You should have started to make some art.
00:10:11.848 - 00:10:29.736, Speaker A: I should have started to make some art. And now we have it blowing up, blowing up generative art. There's avatar art there, there's all kinds. How did you get in the NFT space? What triggered you? And then what really accelerated your journey?
00:10:29.920 - 00:11:10.998, Speaker B: Well, I mean, like I said, I had, when I was in law school, I had an IBM desktop. There were no laptops. I feel like my grandfather when I was young, hamburgers were five cents. I remember when computers only came for your desk and they had a floppy disk on them. And I just got the computer and I took 1000 pages of notes to study for the bar and type them to just familiarize myself with word processing. Change the way we write in the same way jpegs and Photoshop changed the way we think about visual images. So when I was holed away in my room, locked up as a child, alienated, miserable, nearly catatonic, I would collect magazines, cut out pictures, and then collage them onto my wall.
00:11:10.998 - 00:11:55.714, Speaker B: And I've been doing the same thing ever since with visual imagery using any means at my disposal. Like what you said, you just nailed it. Like even in, if you look at the history of digital art, I mean, generative art, like you mentioned, started in the fifties and sixties with generative photography artists like Vera Molnar and Herbert Franke. And then like using all of these different tools, which is what an NFT is, it's a tool. So there was blockchain art before NFTs in 2014, like Kevin Abash and Ray Myers. There's a whole history of Kevin McCoy, of artists, that artists are scavengers. They suck everything in around them and regurgitate it into their analytic approach to what they see.
00:11:55.714 - 00:12:02.318, Speaker B: So, anyway, yeah, I found out about nFts a year and a half ago, but I've been making them my entire life.
00:12:02.366 - 00:12:02.734, Speaker A: Got it.
00:12:02.774 - 00:12:17.598, Speaker B: So. Because no one in the art world would ever take me seriously as an artist. I mean, I've been. I clawed my way painstakingly to where I am sitting with you, which is pretty extraordinary. You have a cameo in Kanye's part three tonight.
00:12:17.646 - 00:12:18.150, Speaker A: Part three.
00:12:18.222 - 00:12:46.544, Speaker B: I just caught a little wee glimpse of it. That's pretty fucking cool. Congratulations. That's epic. That's amazing. Anyway, so someone mentioned those three magical letters to me a year and a half ago, and I just immediately cottoned onto it and I wrote about it. I wrote about it in the art newspaper, and I started dropping with Nifty Gateway when the chief financial officer, Tommy Kimmelman, was also the curator, quote unquote, because they didn't even know what art was, basically, and they were just looking for material.
00:12:46.544 - 00:13:10.008, Speaker B: And I made four grand the first drop. And I was so grateful, again, like, the hair stands up on my arm, like, talking to you. I'm so honored to be here and grateful. Thank you very much. Like, I just. I love people that are self wrought, self accomplished people that have followed their dreams and done extraordinary things. And when I found out about NFTs, when I made four grand, it wasn't terribly much, but it was money that I never.
00:13:10.008 - 00:13:47.176, Speaker B: It never would have happened to me because the art world would never accept me because I'm self taught. I invented my own platform, my own mechanism to express myself with my art. So I was writing, like I said, for 30 years, and then I started to embed my digital videos into my articles. So I started illustrating my writing, and I had a one person show with the best people in the world, like Dan Loeb from Third Point and Len Blavatnik and all of these killer people, because they wanted to know what was happening in the art world. And I'm the only one who couldn't give a shit about all of these things. But dead. I mean, I don't take myself seriously yet.
00:13:47.176 - 00:14:16.660, Speaker B: I'm dead serious about what I do. And I've been in the art world for so long. So I was revealing all of the machinations in the art market, and I would travel to art fairs and auctions across the world and then make videos about it while I was revealing who bought the Jeff Koons bunny that the Prince of Saudi Arabia was hiding his Leonardo da Vinci on his yacht. I broke that story, translated into 50 languages. And then when I found out about NFTs, like I said, I wrote about it. I made them. And like, the first article I wrote, I've now written twelve features.
00:14:16.660 - 00:14:24.526, Speaker B: Given lectures at Harvard Law School, Yale Art Institute of Chicago. I mean, it's pretty cool to think that I've never taken an art class in my life.
00:14:24.590 - 00:14:52.872, Speaker A: What's really interesting is with crypto, it just punches way above its weight in terms of interest. So, like, I'll go to a conference and there'll be ten great speakers, and I'll be the crypto speaker, and the crypto panel will get all the energy, because right now, people just care about crypto, you know? And it's the same with nfTs. NFTs is getting so much energy interest relative to normal art, even though it's still a small, small part.
00:14:52.928 - 00:14:58.200, Speaker B: No, no. You kidding? I mean, it's eclipse. It's going to eclipse the fine art market in two years.
00:14:58.392 - 00:15:03.496, Speaker A: Two years, maybe, but it will. But it's interesting. You're in this moment, and so you jumped on it really quick.
00:15:03.520 - 00:15:35.108, Speaker B: I jumped on it and then I. And then, like, so my. When I was writing my first NFT article for Artnet, which is where I generally write, when I was editing my article that night, I had had my second drop on Nifty Gateway. My expectations in life are always around the bottom. I just safer that way. And as I was editing, I started to get this flood of emails that were evidencing sales on Nifty gateway, and I ended up to have this, a great success, you know, sold like a quarter of a million dollars worth the second time. And that came again.
00:15:35.108 - 00:15:58.410, Speaker B: Like, I was so surprised. Cause I never, I wasn't on discord then. I didn't. I don't sell myself. I mean, I express myself and I love, love, love to help other people. But what you said is such a perfect encapsulation of where we are right now. Every time I did something in Basel, Switzerland, and in Basel, Miami with NFTs, every time I start the conversation, people start to congregate around you.
00:15:58.410 - 00:16:20.100, Speaker B: I mean, doesn't go to my head. I'm bad enough as it is, but, like, it's crazy. Like. Cause people want to learn, they're curious. The reason the art world has pushed back so hard is because humans, human nature is like, one of the characteristics a defense mechanism is to be scared of change. People are scared. People are threatened in the art world.
00:16:20.100 - 00:16:30.372, Speaker B: Larry Gagosi. And I've spoken to him now for almost a year. Like, come on, Larry G. Like, let me do a show with NFTs. You'll love it. It'll be a great success. And that's happening, happening incrementally.
00:16:30.372 - 00:16:53.526, Speaker B: But that's why Sotheby's and Christie's and all the independent platforms, super rare, nifty Gateway foundation, known origin makers place. They jumped into the void and they become these like huge businesses. See huge businesses, even like Sotheby's and Christie's have become primary market makers in the NFTs because the galleries are too chicken. That'll change.
00:16:53.630 - 00:16:56.302, Speaker A: We were literally just looking at, apparently people has a show here.
00:16:56.318 - 00:16:58.158, Speaker B: Yeah. Going to your dinner tomorrow, are you?
00:16:58.206 - 00:17:06.280, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually am flying to LA. I would as well. I love Beeple. He's just hysterical. Yeah, I met him right after he sold that, you know, five.
00:17:06.352 - 00:17:07.896, Speaker B: Pretty wacky, like down to earth.
00:17:07.960 - 00:17:12.560, Speaker A: He from Wisconsin. He laughs like, talks like he's so Wisconsin.
00:17:12.752 - 00:17:39.536, Speaker B: But you know, that's the, that success. It's great to see success come to people that just, I mean, what, I wasn't nuts about his work either, for that matter. But he did his stuff every day for five years or whatever it was. Right? And the fact is that nothing impeded him in the art world because he was, he was a successful, like graphic designer. So the art world would dismiss him. That's a reason they dismissed me because I was a dealer and a curator and a writer and a teacher. So they're like, you can't be an artist.
00:17:39.640 - 00:18:15.794, Speaker A: I mean, one of the most amazing conversations we had, we actually had her on a podcast, people pleaser, the Dow. What she, she was talking about, she was talking to a bunch of very wealthy art collectors at Larry's house. Actually, we crashed one of his parties. And she said, what's unique about the NFT space is our community cares about our art. And with all due respect, we don't need you. And, you know, because they're supporting art and they've made lots of money in crypto and they're young and this is what they care about. Just like your communities supported your art.
00:18:15.794 - 00:18:24.262, Speaker A: And, you know, she did it very gracefully and with manners. Right afterwards, all the, the big collectors were lining up to get her car. Yeah, of course.
00:18:24.438 - 00:18:26.686, Speaker B: I mean, it's funny, it's like Emily Chang.
00:18:26.750 - 00:18:27.158, Speaker A: Love her.
00:18:27.206 - 00:18:50.110, Speaker B: My community didn't, I mean, the art, the fine art community didn't help me at all. Object to me not in. And what I love about, like, the NFT community doesn't judge. They like people that are mavericks, that are outside the norm and based on that alone, like, without even, like, now I'm in the discord because I did a PFP project. I have to go every day and answer to these people. But, like, I love it. It's really fun.
00:18:50.110 - 00:19:00.886, Speaker B: And like Bowie said, like, the Internet, like, conflated, destroyed the space between the artist and the creator and the audience. It's an amazing time. We're in a major transformation in the world.
00:19:00.910 - 00:19:11.934, Speaker A: So what's interesting to me is, like, this technology or this platform has allowed artists to earn a living as long as they have 5600 people around the world that care about them.
00:19:12.014 - 00:19:13.358, Speaker B: You need to nurture an audience, but.
00:19:13.366 - 00:19:40.324, Speaker A: You need to nurture an audience. You need to create a community. You need to continue to put energy into the community. Community. And so we've got platforms like art blocks, which does generative art. And, you know, Dmitry Cherniak and Snowfro and his, that crew really works hard to curate and keep energy in that space. You've got the avatars, you know, the apes, punks, you name them.
00:19:40.324 - 00:20:02.244, Speaker A: The giant space of other creative art, other fine art in the digital space. It's a mess in some ways. How do you see that playing out over time? Will there be galleries just like there are in the physical world? Because there's so much to look at and some of the shit's wildly cool.
00:20:03.064 - 00:20:42.794, Speaker B: I mean, that's a really fantastic question that I think about 24 hours a day. And, well, there's one aside. Like, on Sunday morning, I was sitting in my house and I saw that the president of Ukraine made was reaching out to people to donate to help his cause. And he, and he mentioned a bitcoin and an ethereum. By the way, the reason that NFTs have been going crazy, all you crypto guys created two to $3 trillion of wealth and you had nothing to spend it on. You couldn't do anything with your money. So all of a sudden a bunch of apes, hippos and punks come out and you're like, woo.
00:20:42.874 - 00:20:44.050, Speaker A: I tell people all the time, there's.
00:20:44.082 - 00:20:47.962, Speaker B: A gold rush of, I have buy, buy.
00:20:48.058 - 00:21:10.706, Speaker A: I've been in the markets 35 years and in my whole life I've never seen anything not priced in dollars. When you ask a wealthy mid Easterner, what's he worth? He tells you, in dollars, right? We function in dollars. Or, or if it's euro Europe, euros, nfts are the first thing that trade in a low in a different currency. People trade them in ETH. That's a great point. Bitcoin's not used.
00:21:10.730 - 00:21:13.054, Speaker B: I'm going to have to steal that and use that in my next essay.
00:21:13.634 - 00:21:24.730, Speaker A: Ether has become the currency of culture. Like, bitcoin is just digital gold. No one's buying tennis shoes with bitcoin. We'll preserve our wealth with bitcoin. But people are actually buying shit with Ethereum. They're buying nfts.
00:21:24.802 - 00:21:53.824, Speaker B: I think one of the, you just pointed out to something really interesting that was completely dispelled with this last crisis with Russia is that people refer to bitcoin as a store of wealth equated to gold. But you could see during this crisis, like, bitcoin is something different. It's sort of looking for its utility, and it's a little bit in the air. And ethereum was a practical application to all of the kind of. To all of this theory of decentralized system, alternative to government control.
00:21:53.984 - 00:21:57.836, Speaker A: I always thought of ethereum as a tech beta, and people, still, no way.
00:21:57.940 - 00:21:59.324, Speaker B: I'd never think of it like that.
00:21:59.444 - 00:22:02.676, Speaker A: But it really has now become the currency of culture. It's really shocking.
00:22:02.700 - 00:22:25.142, Speaker B: It's funny, because I have to say, with all due respect to you and your enormous success, I was a bitcoin skeptic, a cynic, because I couldn't care less. All I care about art has given meaning to my life. I mean, there are clinical studies that living with art helps reduce anxiety and blood pressure, makes you live longer, and all this stuff. So bitcoin to me was just like, I didn't really give a ratio. Ask about it.
00:22:25.198 - 00:22:38.118, Speaker A: I'm laughing. I got this huddle, I got this Hodl piece of art. There was an auction in 2017, right when crypto was heating up. And my friend Joe Lubin has this company consensus. So I was trying to be a.
00:22:38.126 - 00:22:41.134, Speaker B: Metamask and palm, Joe Lubin is going.
00:22:41.134 - 00:23:13.734, Speaker A: To fucking buy New York City. But at that point, I was trying to support, and there was an art auction, and there was a really cool cryptokitty, and it was a physical version of the cryptokitty NFT. And I bid. And there was a guy bidding against me on the phone, and I'm sitting there with Richard Kim, who I just hired, who's become an unbelievable force in the NFT space, mostly in the generative side. And he's hit me. He said, dude, you don't want to spend that much. You're going to be in the newspaper.
00:23:13.734 - 00:23:39.698, Speaker A: So I stopped bidding at 110,000. It was for charity. And some, some other guy bids wins it. He came up to me the next day at another crypto conference and he told me who he was and he was very excited and we took pictures and he was so proud he outbid me. But he thought he was a big heavyset guy and he said, you know, I think if you saw me you wouldn't want to lose to a fat guy. So that's why I did it on the phone, you know, trust me, the weight has nothing to with do speaking.
00:23:39.746 - 00:23:41.978, Speaker B: To a fat guy now who knows how to drape fabric?
00:23:42.026 - 00:23:47.728, Speaker A: Well the way it had nothing to do with it but I had to buy something. So I bought this. Hot was my consolation prize.
00:23:47.816 - 00:24:25.692, Speaker B: It was funny, I made so many mistakes with my metadata on my PFP project. I did an exhibition that's up now in Berlin called metadata making fun of the whole data because I just screwed up so much. And that's the same way. But back to you, like from when I found out about NFTs I had no idea what Ethereum was. I always say like now the ETH is in the ether, the genie is out of the bottle and like you can't stuff it back in. If the whole, if there was a crash in crypto beyond what we've seen, this mechanism for selling digital art and you know I'll skip, I'll jump around but I know where I'm going. So like the auction record for a video is $700,000.
00:24:25.692 - 00:24:54.428, Speaker B: Bill Viola, the auction record for like a photograph is $4.3 million. Soon about to be smashed by a man, Ray. Coming up with a five to 7 million pound estimated. And then like there's a filmmaker in the UK, Steve McQueen, not the Steve McQueen actor and he's Oscar winning. He made twelve years a slave as a director and a filmmaker. And his auction record, he's one of the most celebrated Turner prize winning artists in the world is $32,000.
00:24:54.428 - 00:25:30.952, Speaker B: And it's just, it's complete bullshit. Like we are every day. We're like defined by our relationships with our phone, with our computer. Especially during the tragedy of COVID when that was the only window in our lives to look into was our screen. I mean it's ridiculous that. So anyway, when I found back the Ethereum and all that was like the first, the practical application in my life was I could nurture and develop, I could, it recreated me. I was reborn in my late, late fifties as an artist and I sold my pfps with no promotion in less in an hour, 9000 nfts and I've sold another 650 with Nifty Gateway.
00:25:30.952 - 00:26:00.884, Speaker B: I have another drop coming with them. And it's amazing thing, you know, I'm not young, and I've. I've onboarded well over, you know, a thousand people through my lectures and my writing and stuff, and it's awesome. But, like, right now, back to your question, which I remarkably didn't forget. The collectible market is more than 70% of NFT sales. And fine art, as we would think about it, is less than 10%. So as far as I'm concerned, with all the art blocks is amazing.
00:26:00.884 - 00:26:06.624, Speaker B: And Jeff Davis and that whole crowd of people and the chromie squiggles, and they have.
00:26:07.004 - 00:26:08.476, Speaker A: They've got their space. So it's.
00:26:08.540 - 00:26:09.604, Speaker B: That's a billion dollar business.
00:26:09.644 - 00:26:10.956, Speaker A: So I'm looking at the other space.
00:26:10.980 - 00:26:24.636, Speaker B: I think. I think there's room in the other space. Art space, from, as far as I'm concerned, is the area that has the greatest room for growth out of any sector in the entire NFT space.
00:26:24.700 - 00:26:25.388, Speaker A: I 100%.
00:26:25.436 - 00:26:38.154, Speaker B: So I want to try to Nft NYC. That's like a cash crack. I mean, I spoke in it, I'm speaking again. But they were like, selling, oh, we're sold out. Tickets are $500 a week later. Oh, we have another transfer tickets available. Blah, blah.
00:26:38.154 - 00:26:43.690, Speaker B: A week later, same thing. Same thing. They had 600. Anyone who ever said NFT to their grandmother was speaking at NFT.
00:26:43.762 - 00:26:45.802, Speaker A: I read there were 750 speakers and.
00:26:45.818 - 00:27:08.290, Speaker B: They, like, they triple booked. They were so bad. But I want to do something like NFT art, and no one ever writes about the content of the NFTs. Like, we had a brief conversation about it. I mean, there is. I know, and I. It's cheaper to buy a one of one by a genius than it is to buy one of 20,000, you know, me bits by larva labs.
00:27:08.290 - 00:27:14.266, Speaker B: So I think that once people get a little more comfortable in their own skin making their choices, you're hearing it.
00:27:14.330 - 00:27:30.546, Speaker A: Here live on next with Novo. Kenny and I both think there is room in the space for fine art. NFTs for an art blocks for collectors, for gallerists, but a place where the energy shows up together. And so you start, right?
00:27:30.570 - 00:27:49.674, Speaker B: So there's been like, one thing. One thing I hate is like, I hate people. Like, fine art snobs. Nobody wants to be preached to. Like, if I don't know about the history of an old master, you can't. Like, the old world is so hierarchical, so judgmental, always pigeonholing you, looking you up and down. Oh, your sneakers aren't right.
00:27:49.674 - 00:28:05.646, Speaker B: You're, you know, you're not one of us. Or you can. That is changed. They're so stupid. And I have been. Before I got into the art world, I thought everyone was drinking absinthe, hanging from the chandelier and going to orgies. The art world is the most conservative business out of any in the world.
00:28:05.646 - 00:28:20.367, Speaker B: And the way that I have to go to discord. These people spent $80 on my crypto mutts. I sold my soul for dollar 80. I was always waiting for an offer and never came. But the fact is, I love it because they're vested with their hard earned money and they're interested. They want to know. So I would love to grow with them in.
00:28:20.367 - 00:28:25.272, Speaker A: And once they own it, they have a vested interest in bringing people into the community. That's the beauty about these.
00:28:25.328 - 00:28:47.688, Speaker B: And it's also like the role, the artist and the collector, the community. This is a new definition of the human relations in art. And I think that it's not for artists to like. This isn't. It's art for everybody. And you have to address your audience, and you have to think about your audience in ways that artists never did. Not to kowtow or to suck up to them, but just take them at heart.
00:28:47.688 - 00:28:50.280, Speaker B: And then you have to speak to them and explain yourself. Why.
00:28:50.352 - 00:28:57.136, Speaker A: Give me three NFT artists that people haven't heard of that you like, applying.
00:28:57.160 - 00:29:13.774, Speaker B: Some screws to me? And Sarah friend is a brilliant woman. She's canadian, won't hold that against her. I don't even know what that means. Okay. She lives in Berlin, studied painting, taught herself coding, and she's just awesome.
00:29:13.814 - 00:29:15.598, Speaker A: Sarah friend. I'm gonna buy one of Sarah friend.
00:29:15.686 - 00:29:47.670, Speaker B: You could buy one of her nfts. She's environmentally conscious, so she hasn't gone on Ethereum, but she's done a bunch of other stuff. And I bought her work from $35 for an NFT to 7000. And I think she's fantastic. And there's Ray Myers. I think what's really cool also about this NFT space is there are artists from all spectrums, from all walks of life, from all continents, from all identifications.
00:29:47.742 - 00:29:49.894, Speaker A: Those global people always forget, we're not.
00:29:49.934 - 00:30:09.042, Speaker B: Judging about global, you know, like ferocious. No one's judging about what you were before. It's just what you are now and what you want to say, and that's all that matters. So Ray Myers is a really cool artist. Darren Bader. Kevin Abash is a little more successful and well known. But you could still get his stuff for like, an ETH or something.
00:30:09.042 - 00:30:35.724, Speaker B: There's a lot of really. So I'm going to work on some kind of a conference. I've curated a bunch of shows. I have this nft u Crane Ukraine to charity event where there are things for, well, underneath. And there's all really cool artists. Olive Allen is an artist that I've known for a while who helped me onboard me in the beginning. So I just think also this whole, like, discord community thing, there's a lot of people that.
00:30:35.724 - 00:30:48.684, Speaker B: I have never seen this since the recession in New York in the nineties where people are caring about other people and helping other people to share the information and to help each other in a way I haven't seen for decades.
00:30:48.724 - 00:31:03.830, Speaker A: You know, I talk about this all the time because crypto can often be seen as, oh, a bunch of guys trying to pull scams. And I was like, no, no, you guys are missing the point. At the core of the crypto community is what you saw with all these donations to the Ukraine. Right? What? The core of the crypto community is people that want to do good.
00:31:03.902 - 00:31:04.222, Speaker B: Yes.
00:31:04.278 - 00:31:07.390, Speaker A: Gen Z and millennials who are looking at a different way of living.
00:31:07.502 - 00:31:08.814, Speaker B: And of course, like this.
00:31:08.894 - 00:31:10.074, Speaker A: There's plenty of scams.
00:31:11.054 - 00:31:21.118, Speaker B: But I had my bank account, like, hacked your regular old bank account, credit Swiss, no less. And they just. They go into your emails, they read your language, then they go to, like, try to.
00:31:21.166 - 00:31:22.054, Speaker A: Oh, trust me.
00:31:22.174 - 00:31:24.598, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, I always say there's a bell.
00:31:24.646 - 00:31:26.270, Speaker A: Many times there's a bell's curve of.
00:31:26.302 - 00:31:43.726, Speaker B: Integrity in the world. And it has nothing to do with Ethereum or NFTs, the art world. No one ever calculated the environmental footprint of shipping crates and traveling to an art fair. It's ridiculous. You get these crates there, you throw them in the garbage. I just. I have a big exhibition I curated next week in New York, and we're throwing away crates every day now.
00:31:43.726 - 00:31:58.438, Speaker B: It's shameful, but there's no way to recycle them. And then, like, that's it. So, I mean, for me, it's just. It's changed my life. I never gave up. I always held out hope that if I just do what I love, opportunities will come. And they are coming.
00:31:58.486 - 00:32:15.878, Speaker A: Well, Kenny, there's not a better example of. Cause I got criticized because I'm often at my own company, say, we gotta hire younger people. And my CEO grabbed me and she said, you gotta shut up about that. You gotta hire people that care about this movement. And she was dead right. And you're at least my age, I'm not gonna tell you.
00:32:15.886 - 00:32:17.114, Speaker B: A lot older.
00:32:17.474 - 00:32:21.858, Speaker A: And you approach this with the passion of a newborn and I love it.
00:32:22.026 - 00:32:30.794, Speaker B: That makes you live longer. That gives, you know, people that work live. Retiring is. I can never see you like hitting a ball around on a golf course.
00:32:30.834 - 00:32:32.570, Speaker A: I'm thinking about NFT and my tattoo.
00:32:32.722 - 00:32:34.850, Speaker B: I have nft ism.
00:32:34.922 - 00:32:37.546, Speaker A: I love Nft on his arm. Guys.
00:32:37.610 - 00:32:38.498, Speaker B: I trademarked that.
00:32:38.546 - 00:32:44.266, Speaker A: That's Kenny Schachter. This is next term Shaktur Schachter. Why did I see Shaktur?
00:32:44.330 - 00:32:44.906, Speaker B: I don't care.
00:32:44.970 - 00:32:47.074, Speaker A: I'm gonna have to redo that. Kenny Schachter.
00:32:47.194 - 00:32:50.994, Speaker B: You can say whatever you want, bro. I don't care. I'm happy to be sitting here.
00:32:51.114 - 00:32:55.674, Speaker A: The best advertisement for NFTs and NFt energy I've seen a long time. Thanks a lot, Kenny.
00:32:55.714 - 00:32:58.194, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me. It means a lot to me. Awesome.
