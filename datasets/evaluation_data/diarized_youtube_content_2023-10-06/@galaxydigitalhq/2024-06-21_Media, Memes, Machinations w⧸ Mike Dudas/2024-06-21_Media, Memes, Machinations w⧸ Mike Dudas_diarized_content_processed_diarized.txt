00:00:00.640 - 00:00:10.958, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.126 - 00:00:11.990, Speaker B: If you're not long.
00:00:12.062 - 00:00:13.594, Speaker A: If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.894 - 00:00:19.354, Speaker C: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.654 - 00:00:22.114, Speaker B: Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.774 - 00:00:43.168, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy. Bitcoin, not zero. And we have a great episode for you. Mike Dudas, co founder and managing partner of 6th Man Ventures, originally CEO and founder of the Block. Is our guest going to talk with Mike about a whole variety of things.
00:00:43.168 - 00:01:16.004, Speaker A: Politics and policy, the trends that he sees that he's investing, and a lot about use cases and apps, less about infrastructure with apparently Mike and six man ventures. Fun conversation. I've known Mike a long time. Great to have him here. And of course we'll check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the show.
00:01:16.004 - 00:01:22.696, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:22.800 - 00:01:23.784, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:23.904 - 00:01:48.294, Speaker A: What is happening? Because we are recording this a day earlier than we normally do. So it's Tuesday the 17th, sorry, Tuesday the 18th. And so it hasn't been that long since we talked last Wednesday, but some data came in. I mean, where did we stand? I saw a headline that said a big bank was maintaining their two cuts before the end of the year outlook. Despite hawkish language last week from the FOMc stuff. Where, where do we stand in your mind?
00:01:48.594 - 00:02:38.372, Speaker C: I think that, you know, the Fed is, is going to be more inclined to cut this year than was stated during FOMC versus what they had in the dot plot. I think you've seen CPI data turn lower and key components in CPI move lower like housing came in at 0.3. PPI was soft. And if you extrapolate the components of CPI and PPI, you're looking at a PCE print next week that is going to be anywhere from like 0.15 to 0.2. The Cleveland now cast has it at 0.21 month on month, and so you're looking at an annualized PCE number that's going to be close to your two six area, which is right on target, which is what the Fed wants.
00:02:38.372 - 00:03:20.624, Speaker C: In addition, you've seen softening in employment indicators. You've seen, although non farm payrolls is the small exception to that. And then you've also seen retail sales missed to the downside today and over the past couple of releases. In addition to that, you had revisions lower to retail sales of the prior month today. So it looks like spending is coming in soft. You've got inflation indicators that are moving more towards target, and you've got employment kind of softening as well. And that means that the Fed is definitely headed in the right direction and could certainly be warranted in cuts.
00:03:20.624 - 00:04:12.132, Speaker C: Taking it a step further. Further, I think that the data is going to continue to deteriorate over the next couple of months. We're going to see probably a bigger uptick in unemployment as a function of some revisions, and you're probably going to see continued slowing in broader economic trends as well. And then you're going to start to be in a situation whereby the September FOMC, or even the July FOMC, where it really makes sense to start cutting. Because if you think inflation is moving to target and you're confident that it's moving to target, then you are probably 200 basis points too high in terms of where rates are currently set right. Neutral is probably somewhere close to 3%, and right now the fed funds range is 525 to 550. And so that means you could, in theory, be very far away from neutral.
00:04:12.132 - 00:05:10.138, Speaker C: So I really think that you're on the cusp of a very significant kind of light switch going off in the market. That being that data's turned enough to warrant cutting. And if logically you're at the point where you're like, I'm comfortable cutting, then you should really be thinking about the magnitude of your cut and how quickly you should be doing your cuts to get to neutral. I really think you're on the cusp of the market starting to think about cuts in the 50 bip incremental, back to back fifties even. Because realistically, if unemployment really is coming lower, I've got a guy telling me that the payroll revisions coming out in August are going to take unemployment close to four three. The summary of economic projections that were released for June during last FOMC had unemployment going to 4% right. And so I think we're at three nine now.
00:05:10.138 - 00:05:11.274, Speaker C: And so if you could.
00:05:11.314 - 00:05:12.826, Speaker A: Pretty big jump, you could be at.
00:05:12.890 - 00:05:33.434, Speaker C: Like 4243 pretty quickly. And then you're going to tell me that peak core PCE is at 2.6%, which is, let's just say that's pretty good. And so quickly, the market could be at a point where they're like, wow, employment softening, inflation is softening. Everything seems to be turning lower. So why are we at 5%?
00:05:33.554 - 00:05:47.656, Speaker A: And now this is the soft landing attempt. Right? Because the other argument would be that the risk of reinflation is so high that, like, it can still bear more. But the danger from that is that you end up having the economy have a pretty hard landing.
00:05:47.720 - 00:05:48.032, Speaker C: Correct.
00:05:48.088 - 00:05:52.880, Speaker A: Because once you start accelerating from 3.9, you're seeing the 4.3. That's a pretty big jump if that were to happen.
00:05:52.992 - 00:05:53.768, Speaker C: No, absolutely.
00:05:53.816 - 00:06:00.464, Speaker A: All of a sudden, it's like, holy crap, like, unemployment picture is looking a lot worse, better if you want to cut worse.
00:06:00.504 - 00:06:07.434, Speaker C: If you are, so many things that already are signaling, like, you know, part time employment this year is up 18%.
00:06:07.544 - 00:06:20.798, Speaker A: Well, isn't that a big, like, you know, you look into these numbers. Isn't that a big part of the unemployment picture when we say that, you know, when the president, for example, takes credit for having unemployment come down so much in a lot of those jobs, like doordash and stuff like that.
00:06:20.846 - 00:06:21.630, Speaker C: No, absolutely.
00:06:21.702 - 00:06:22.830, Speaker A: Like, more than ever before.
00:06:22.902 - 00:06:35.954, Speaker C: And there are, like, estimates about, you know, sole proprietorships, how many jobs that those things at. And so there's lots of weird anomalies, and Powell is openly talking about it. And so, you know, and that's why they pay attention to things like the revisions.
00:06:36.464 - 00:07:04.966, Speaker A: Is there a, we've talked before on this podcast about, for example, Trump politically or the White House generally politically, either trying to influence the Fed or not influence the fed or the Fed's role in that sort of political situation. Like, wouldn't cut, like, big cuts or, like any cuts even right before the election. I mean, isn't that, isn't there some risk, I think you might have said before that theoretically you'd prefer not to do that. If you're trying to, not to appear to be apolitical, doesn't that have a big impact, you think? I mean, one way or another.
00:07:05.150 - 00:07:21.670, Speaker C: I mean, at the end of the day, there's a ton of people that vote with their wallets. They don't care if the politicians are giving them the money or it's a private corporation. And so, you know, I think there's a lot of voters that are like, I'm happy with where my wallet is and what policies are. And so I might.
00:07:21.702 - 00:07:27.454, Speaker A: Cause if they cut rates, it gets easier to buy homes cheaper and possibly your assets go up. So you're.
00:07:27.494 - 00:07:27.878, Speaker C: Possibly.
00:07:27.926 - 00:07:31.606, Speaker A: Maybe, maybe. I mean, no, no, it's just, well, probably in the long run it's totally possible.
00:07:31.710 - 00:08:08.260, Speaker C: But you know, what I would say though is I would pay attention to the measures that are currently being talked about by the administration. They're stupor, stimulative. Right. They're talking about more relief for first time homebuyers or first generation homebuyers. I think there was a program announced the other day that gives you 25k back, which is tantamount to closing costs on the average home these days. There are more measures to enhance Social Security in terms of eligibility. Folks that are on like Snap benefits, you know, they might now become eligible to receive some Social Security benefits.
00:08:08.260 - 00:08:23.804, Speaker C: There's chatter about, you know, home equity loans and what the, you know, the Fannie and Freddie can do to help assist in that. And so what you're basically seeing from the democratic administration is all hands effort to stimulate the economy going into the election.
00:08:23.844 - 00:08:23.972, Speaker A: So.
00:08:23.988 - 00:08:24.140, Speaker C: Fair.
00:08:24.172 - 00:08:31.596, Speaker A: So it's part of your point that, you know, a 25 bit cut or even a 50 bit cut, they're already doing plenty on the election side of it regardless.
00:08:31.660 - 00:08:34.434, Speaker C: So it's not like these are at the dead highs.
00:08:34.474 - 00:08:35.338, Speaker B: Look at the stock market.
00:08:35.386 - 00:08:40.154, Speaker A: I know. I mean, I mean, do they just go, let's say we go on a cutting cycle, they just keep going high.
00:08:40.274 - 00:09:00.346, Speaker C: I mean, I heard it best the other day. Some guy was like, so people are telling me that bad news is good news for stocks. And then when there's good news, people are telling me good news is good news for stocks. And this week I heard that no news is also good for stocks. So we're just stuck in the point where it looks like it's one of the best hedges in the world.
00:09:00.450 - 00:09:05.270, Speaker A: And if you look at it, is a great hedge, right. The classic inflation head is equities, right?
00:09:05.302 - 00:09:05.446, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:05.470 - 00:09:11.894, Speaker A: And they earn cash. But also if you look at the, like, I don't know, multi decade history of the us stock market, not on.
00:09:11.974 - 00:09:15.862, Speaker C: And it doesn't matter what administration is in office. Administrative agnostic.
00:09:15.998 - 00:09:27.126, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, is it, this is a little bit more existential just for the last minute or two here. But is it really up? Have you seen that like adjusted for inflation chart where like the peak was like 1929 in the us stock market.
00:09:27.190 - 00:09:27.486, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:27.550 - 00:09:32.306, Speaker A: Like, if we adjust for like, m two or whichever metric we need, it's actually, like, on a real basis, like.
00:09:32.330 - 00:09:40.578, Speaker C: Kind of the big popular one among crypto folks is like, relative to the balance sheet. And so, yeah, you know, you could think about it.
00:09:40.626 - 00:09:41.442, Speaker A: Maybe that's why it's up.
00:09:41.458 - 00:09:45.370, Speaker C: Cause the dollar is weakening and this is just another expression of that.
00:09:45.442 - 00:09:47.754, Speaker A: Well, it's maybe one way to at least tread water.
00:09:47.874 - 00:09:48.218, Speaker C: Yes.
00:09:48.266 - 00:09:56.986, Speaker A: The other thing is, isn't it mostly just like we don't like to name single name equities, but isn't it mostly just like one stock that's basically leading, or like a handful?
00:09:57.090 - 00:10:38.342, Speaker C: It's like four, five, and the magnificent seven is what they're known as. And the big part of about them that's very unique from any other point in history is the magnitude of the stock buybacks programs that they have. They are literally constantly on the bid for their own shares. Every day that passes that those programs are active is less supply, less float in those companies, and there's a constant bid. And then you have the performance issue where folks are benchmarked to these indexes, and these indexes just keep outperforming most of these folks. And so they're forced to chase, and you're gonna have another Santa Claus rally to the election. And if you're not long, these big names, you're short.
00:10:38.342 - 00:10:45.734, Speaker C: And so it becomes one of those things where, you know, you just have to keep up and it becomes, you know, very self fulfilling. Exactly.
00:10:45.774 - 00:10:49.358, Speaker A: I mean, even I didn't want to buy some of these big AI stocks.
00:10:49.406 - 00:10:50.750, Speaker C: Like, and now you're like, three months.
00:10:50.782 - 00:10:52.822, Speaker A: Ago, I thought I was super late, and I was.
00:10:52.918 - 00:10:56.310, Speaker C: No, I mean, we could talk about the AI. I really.
00:10:56.422 - 00:10:57.838, Speaker A: They called the AI rally.
00:10:57.966 - 00:11:00.134, Speaker C: Yeah, like, no, but Nick Carter, by.
00:11:00.134 - 00:11:05.078, Speaker A: The way, it's not just that one stock, it's several of those stocks all have big AI components and.
00:11:05.126 - 00:11:16.180, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely. And honestly, I think that the AI theme is here to last for decades to come. It's got implications on everything from power to productivity.
00:11:16.252 - 00:11:17.604, Speaker A: That's what Nick was saying. Yeah.
00:11:17.684 - 00:11:45.676, Speaker C: And he's actually tweeting some good essays out this weekend, one of which I read. But what startled me was really how folks are dramatically underestimating the power demand growth that we're going to see over the next decade. I heard, you know, a couple months ago, you know, I was hearing figures that were like, 10% increase in power production is needed. And the paper I read is like, that's, you need at least 20% plus.
00:11:45.740 - 00:11:58.652, Speaker A: Wow. Well, it's gonna be a big deal that. I mean, yeah, the amount of electricity, this was just crazy. We need nuclear. I'm coming back on the nuclear train, but we'll save that for another conversation. Bim net Abibi from Galaxy trading. My friend, thank you so much.
00:11:58.708 - 00:11:59.704, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:12:00.504 - 00:12:07.704, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Mike Dudas, managing partner, co founder, founder of six Man Ventures. Mike, thanks for coming on. Galaxy Brains.
00:12:07.784 - 00:12:09.264, Speaker B: Thank you for having me. Lovely to be here.
00:12:09.304 - 00:12:33.686, Speaker A: I first met you in the block's office, I think, in Noho, right? Just north of Houston somewhere. Indeed. And so I should say for anyone who doesn't know, also co founder, founder and former CEO of the block. One of few true crypto trade publications and now, I guess, research company and other stuff as well. You're not at the block any longer.
00:12:33.790 - 00:12:34.246, Speaker B: No.
00:12:34.350 - 00:12:42.294, Speaker A: So I'd love to hear the story from your perspective, but actually, before we even do that. Cause you were also, you had long background in payments before you did the block.
00:12:42.374 - 00:12:43.054, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:12:43.174 - 00:12:47.422, Speaker A: Maybe give us a little bit of your story before we get to the block. And then, of course, six man, I'll.
00:12:47.438 - 00:13:28.782, Speaker B: Try and do it as quickly as possible. So I'm 45, I'm a pre boomer, I like to say, but it means that I had a career before crypto. So I started at Disney and I worked in their corporate dev and M and a group, went to business school, spent two years not learning, but having a great time came out, had no idea what I wanted to do. Moved to New York and have been in the tri state area ever since. Moved to Connecticut, but basically moving to New York at that sort of uptake time in startups and technology. In New York, it was becoming the second place to Silicon Valley. So I worked at startup for a few years, and then I ended up at Google, New York's Google office.
00:13:28.782 - 00:14:00.166, Speaker B: And that was sort of like the innovation office for a bunch of different experiments. The first was kind of YouTube media type stuff, and the second was Google Wallet. And that was literally where I got introduced. I'd never worked, I had no qualifications to work in payments and fintech financial institutions. I'd never worked on Wall street. But Google allowed, you know, folks who were sort of top performers to just jump into a new challenge. Okay, Google Wallet was 15 years before its time.
00:14:00.166 - 00:14:11.838, Speaker B: The idea was you'd tap your phone at a terminal at Duane Reed or Walgreens, and, you know, it would transmit your payment, your loyalty information, your coupons. Anyway, yeah, that still hasn't happened.
00:14:11.966 - 00:14:14.814, Speaker A: Yeah. It's only the credit card tab, basically.
00:14:14.934 - 00:14:25.696, Speaker B: Right, exactly. With maybe a loyalty card, you get your passes. And what's wild is not even technology like NFC, where you tap, it's like a QR code, typically still when you go to the airport.
00:14:25.800 - 00:14:26.712, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true.
00:14:26.848 - 00:14:27.440, Speaker B: That's how.
00:14:27.512 - 00:14:31.080, Speaker A: Oh, wow. So that's really what it was. It was like tickets and those types of things.
00:14:31.192 - 00:14:31.848, Speaker B: Totally, totally.
00:14:31.896 - 00:14:43.376, Speaker A: I think even when I do the, like, the priority pass, for example, like for lounges and airports, like, I can have it in my wallet, but I'm not sure if it. NFC taps. I think it just shows me the number and I can show it to them.
00:14:43.440 - 00:15:07.950, Speaker B: That's. You either show that most often in Europe they do it better, and in Asia, of course, they. Well, Asia's QR codes. But even coming in here today, we're not tapping like, I had to show my QR code to get into the Galaxy event. So anyway, that's the technology that's manifested itself. I think it's a good lesson for crypto. It's not always the best technology or the easiest, but it's sort of the one that's the most ubiquitous and easiest for folks to understand.
00:15:08.022 - 00:15:10.694, Speaker A: And then you were at a payments company, Braintree, right?
00:15:10.734 - 00:15:10.886, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:10.910 - 00:15:50.976, Speaker B: So I left Google wallet, learned a lot, and then went to Braintree, which had bought Venmo. So Venmo at the time had fewer than 20 employees, and I was sort of like the adult in the room at 35 working on, hey, how do we get Venmo to basically do enterprise deals? So Venmo was like this p two P app while I was there in a year. It wasn't me, by the way, but it went from 30,000 active users to over a million. They ran subway ads, and it was really the first successful breakout consumer payments app in the US since PayPal. Wild success. And so they said, hey, well, we can become PayPal. Like, we'll do, like, Venmo pay.
00:15:51.040 - 00:15:53.480, Speaker A: So anyway, checkout and whatever online.
00:15:53.632 - 00:16:22.260, Speaker B: Exactly. All of those things. And Venmo's advantage and Braintree's advantage is they worked with Uber, with Airbnb, with Grubhub, with all these early mobile payments companies. So it was really, really exciting. Learned a lot about payments. But what was interesting about mobile is every single one of the companies that had a mobile app and had a mobile payments experience wanted to own their own stack. And by the way, you see some of these parallels now as we start to talk about app chains, breakout apps, and crypto.
00:16:22.292 - 00:16:28.172, Speaker A: I remember you were saying the joke was like every one of those companies, like the Apples and the Ubers, they all wanted to become their own bank.
00:16:28.268 - 00:16:28.788, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:16:28.836 - 00:16:34.060, Speaker A: But now one of the jokes, I think this has even progressed. But it was like every wallet wanted to become its own exchange, right?
00:16:34.172 - 00:16:40.668, Speaker B: That's literally what's happening. And every app wants to become its own app chain with its own permissions. And, you know, on the whole stack.
00:16:40.716 - 00:16:42.468, Speaker A: On the validators, unquestionably.
00:16:42.516 - 00:17:23.714, Speaker B: Why not? When you see base for Coinbase getting all those sequencing fees, why wouldn't you want to launch your own chain? So there are so many analogies to what we experienced ten years ago and beyond. But the one thing that was really illuminating is payments are really expensive. As you know, Uber, even the biggest merchants were paying three, four, 5%. A lot of fraud to the card networks and the issuers. So they were looking at bitcoin. Braintree was looking in PayPal, at maybe bitcoin payments, and that was what got me interested in cryptocurrency. And at the time, bitcoin fees were much lower.
00:17:23.714 - 00:17:36.398, Speaker B: The reason bitcoin didn't work at that time for payments is the block settlement time. So basically, by the time it would settle, there was so many opportunities for chargebacks, for fraud, for this you had.
00:17:36.406 - 00:17:42.124, Speaker A: To stand there for. I mean, honestly, especially if you're trying to wait for a couple confirmations. Could be an hour.
00:17:42.204 - 00:17:42.628, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:17:42.676 - 00:17:43.556, Speaker A: It's just not going to work.
00:17:43.620 - 00:17:44.212, Speaker B: And again, we're.
00:17:44.268 - 00:17:50.676, Speaker A: Is that the main cost, by the way, in payments that really balloons the cost is the fraud and the chargebacks. Is that the.
00:17:50.820 - 00:17:59.724, Speaker B: Yeah, and then, and then the marketing, meaning like, basically payments is so competitive that to get me to use your card versus somebody else's card, that's a.
00:17:59.724 - 00:18:00.540, Speaker A: Lot of cards, too.
00:18:00.612 - 00:18:04.196, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm gonna have to give you incentives. And those typically get charged back to the.
00:18:04.220 - 00:18:05.524, Speaker A: So the points, the.
00:18:05.684 - 00:18:12.934, Speaker B: All that stuff exactly like Amex, I think, is right around their buildings next door. They're a really expensive card for merchants.
00:18:12.974 - 00:18:23.354, Speaker A: I know they hate it. I carry a visa. I have the MX platinum, mostly because I fly in Delta and it gets into the lounge, but I carry a visa around just in case, basically because a lot of. Don't take it.
00:18:23.694 - 00:18:27.350, Speaker B: I was in Switzerland last week and it's less than 50%.
00:18:27.422 - 00:18:51.020, Speaker A: Oh, wow. It seemed widely accepted in the UK. Just. It's a little bit of a tangent. So was the part of the idea, and maybe since you were payments background guy, the credit cards and the debit cards, they're all this pull system, where, like, okay, you have to swipe, theoretically, but I mean, you can also just, like, if I give you my card number, you can basically just charge me whenever you want. Right. And I guess that's kind of where the fraud comes from.
00:18:51.020 - 00:18:58.652, Speaker A: Right. Because if I lose it, there's. There's no cryptographic signature actually occurring. Right. Like, you just suck it from me. Whereas with bitcoin. And it's a good point.
00:18:58.708 - 00:19:17.588, Speaker B: So what happens is you're gonna. They do have all your customer information. You're like Kyc beyond belief. Right. So if your specific card demonstrates. So I haven't had fraud on my card, and I've had it for x number of years. Like, they're going to prove virtually every transaction, even if, like, I put in the postal code wrong.
00:19:17.588 - 00:19:18.544, Speaker B: Zip code wrong.
00:19:19.164 - 00:19:19.732, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:19.828 - 00:19:29.156, Speaker B: But as soon as a pattern starts to develop, to your point, they'll start to reject more transactions, and then you start this loop where it's difficult.
00:19:29.220 - 00:19:29.700, Speaker A: Is that true?
00:19:29.732 - 00:19:30.156, Speaker B: Yep.
00:19:30.260 - 00:19:41.250, Speaker A: So for you specifically, even if I get a different card, they'll be like, well, he's. Whatever it is he's doing. Like, we don't think he's stealing from us, but, like, he's sloppy with his number or whatever, but with crypto.
00:19:41.282 - 00:19:41.402, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:41.418 - 00:19:44.546, Speaker A: It's a. It's all. It's a push system. Right. You can't. That's one of the interesting things.
00:19:44.610 - 00:19:46.178, Speaker B: I mean, it's. Again, it's a bear asset.
00:19:46.226 - 00:19:49.194, Speaker A: Right. I mean, you have to cryptographically sign every time it's.
00:19:49.274 - 00:19:52.106, Speaker B: And it's gone. Like, you're right. Offering it up. It's not crowded.
00:19:52.130 - 00:20:00.162, Speaker A: Right? That's true. I can't. I can't say. Oh, just kidding. I'll pull it back. No, this was one of the interesting things in crypto that I saw people were trying to solve, which. And I think Visa put out.
00:20:00.162 - 00:20:19.624, Speaker A: If I remember, it was either Visa or Mastercard, but I'm going with Visa on this one. They both do a lot in crypto, and payments was a. I think they had a paper on a recurring subscription standard for crypto, which is actually quite confusing and complicated given that you don't want to have to. It's not really recurring. If I have to go in and sign a transaction every month.
00:20:19.704 - 00:20:35.474, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I think these are. I know actually, for a fact they're pilots. They're. I like that they're experimenting most of those things, including things like stablecoin settlement on the visa network. These are proof of concepts that I think.
00:20:35.474 - 00:21:00.914, Speaker B: I'm really excited that they're testing this stuff out, but it's not material to them from a financial perspective. I think what they're saying is, just think about visa. It's a network of networks. They support so many different payment networks in individual countries, and you name it. The way that they look at Ethereum or the way that they look at Solana is, hey, that's a settlement network. Right?
00:21:00.954 - 00:21:03.466, Speaker A: That's something we can extend to that one.
00:21:03.530 - 00:21:21.266, Speaker B: Yeah. If we have merchants who prefer to accept stablecoin, then we will settle to Ethereum, we will settle to these l two s, or we will settle this lana or bitcoin, increasingly. But again, you and I both know, I mean, like, yeah, it would be like a piece of dust on this.
00:21:21.330 - 00:21:22.586, Speaker A: Compared to the map of math, compared.
00:21:22.610 - 00:21:23.634, Speaker B: To the core business.
00:21:23.674 - 00:21:51.990, Speaker A: One of the things I love about the fact, by the way, that visa and Mastercard in particular, and both of them have a lot going on in the space, they do. Yeah. One of the things I love about that is that there's a tendency, I think it hasn't been, that banks should also control the payment rails. And this is one of the things I fear about certain of the stablecoin regulation proposals where it's got to go to banks. That's what a big dispute is. All the banks can only issue them. Right.
00:21:51.990 - 00:22:03.290, Speaker A: And it's like, the reality is banks are lending organizations. They shouldn't, they don't need to and perhaps shouldn't also control the payment rails for the whole world. They don't today.
00:22:03.362 - 00:22:03.522, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:03.538 - 00:22:19.442, Speaker A: I mean, payments companies are huge and separate. I hope that, for example, a visa or a Mastercard, if they so choose, could be able to issue a stable coin. They already handle a large amount of the dollar payments in the world. Right. And banks versus payments, is that something you encountered or thought about?
00:22:19.538 - 00:23:05.082, Speaker B: Yeah. So historically, to your point, the banks have competed to issue, like their core business models are credit or basically making money off my financial investment. So they're what's called the issuer and they'll give me a line of credit and then I will get my credit card or my debit card. So either it's either a credit card where they're giving me credit to go pay for things, and I can use the Visa network or the Mastercard network to pay, or it's debit where I have an account with a bank and they're simply debiting my account as I go pay using, to your point, a separate network. Right. Mastercard or Visa network or like those.
00:23:05.218 - 00:23:09.714, Speaker A: Maybe those are the ATM networks, but on the back of the debit cards when it's like, oh, Star, Star.
00:23:09.754 - 00:23:43.224, Speaker B: Yeah, those, yeah, exactly. So as I mentioned, network of networks, the Visa network, the Mastercard network, do include a number of different nodes, other folks who they have like sort of settlement and transmission agreements with. Okay, so it's like this complex web across both. And then there's debit and credit, but. And then beyond that, at the bank level where you're talking about, it's not just debit and credit. There's wire networks. Right.
00:23:43.224 - 00:23:47.296, Speaker B: There's like Swift and Sepa. There's like so much. Exactly.
00:23:47.360 - 00:23:47.656, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:47.720 - 00:24:09.712, Speaker B: I do think there would be conflict, and it really hasn't worked out when the person who's sort of like issuing you the credit is also the one who's directing and routing the network. And by the way, what's interesting is you have those conflicts actually a bit more in crypto. In many cases where the holder or the smart contract is actually doing maybe some of the routing on or the.
00:24:09.728 - 00:24:20.206, Speaker A: Widespread use of exchanges, it's like the one that holds it is also where I trade it. It's also my wallet. I mean, it shouldn't be. I don't use an exchange as a wallet, but many people do and did.
00:24:20.270 - 00:24:20.614, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:20.694 - 00:24:26.182, Speaker A: I have a huge problem with FTX. I mean, that was, you know, whole funds got wiped out, managed funds.
00:24:26.238 - 00:25:06.502, Speaker B: And I think. So I'm somebody who does do that. Right. So I have, of course, my own self custody. And obviously as a firm, we have a robust self custody set of practices at six man ventures. One note on that, it's become increasingly difficult for assets that a centralized custodian can support. We've actually been getting pushed more and more by us regulators to put our assets that we believe we know how to custody ourselves with a high degree of security and sort of independence we've been pushed to.
00:25:06.502 - 00:25:13.462, Speaker B: And actually, if we do that, we can then use them on chain and actually increase the returns depending on what.
00:25:13.478 - 00:25:18.336, Speaker A: It is, you might have a fiduciary response. We started to argue pretty straightforward.
00:25:18.480 - 00:25:42.684, Speaker B: We put notes out to different stakeholders, I can't name them specifically, who are reviewing. We're registered investment advisor practices as galaxy in the US, and effectively saying we believe that if we can't self custody and do things unchained for the protocols that we've invested in, that we're actually giving up economic opportunity and not acting as a fiduciary.
00:25:43.584 - 00:25:54.814, Speaker A: It's a tricky question because we're talking about the custody rule, basically the SEC's custody rule, which they formally, I think, extended. I don't know, has this gone into effect or. I don't think it's actually gone into effect.
00:25:54.894 - 00:26:15.472, Speaker B: It hasn't. But you basically, as a manager, you have to act somewhat conservatively, as if it will, because, you know, based on the history of enforcement actions over the past few years, that they're going to assume there's going to be basically, most likely, if the regime stays the same, a bad faith interpretation of their behavior.
00:26:15.558 - 00:26:20.584, Speaker A: Right. Because they'll say, look, I mean, you can't say you didn't know what we were gonna do because it's been published.
00:26:21.284 - 00:26:39.264, Speaker B: And we would be like, well, the way that you introduced that sort of violated the principles of how these things are viewed. And we disagree with it, and we commented, and you asked us for comment, but then you didn't respond to them. And we'll go back and forth. But ultimately, that's not the position that we believe, as firm stewards of capital, we should take.
00:26:39.844 - 00:27:02.846, Speaker A: So the custody rule provides. Well, it is a rule, and the SEC has provided guidance and clarity on how SEC registered investment advisors. So think about managed funds on behalf of other people. Need to custody the assets that they manage on behalf of those people. Now that could be equities, commodities. Well, it didn't. It used to basically be securities, primarily.
00:27:02.846 - 00:27:06.526, Speaker A: And they said these have to be held at a qualified custodian. So that's typically a bank.
00:27:06.590 - 00:27:14.246, Speaker B: And then they created this new thing, thing that, like, literally is not defined, doesn't exist. Crypto asset securities. I don't know what that is.
00:27:14.270 - 00:27:16.966, Speaker A: But I think also in this new version, they also added commodities.
00:27:17.030 - 00:27:17.422, Speaker B: They did.
00:27:17.478 - 00:27:26.542, Speaker A: So now it's like if I hold gold for somebody or something else, a lot of people aren't aware, but there may not be qualified custodians for those. And yes, crypto assets.
00:27:26.718 - 00:28:19.444, Speaker B: So that's the other thing is we could have made a choice. Most of the top firms were based in America, but of course, we have offshore funds that we do a number of our investments through, like every other crypto fund, because that's the only way you can operate. But you basically, it's like you could take, there's like a fork in the road, and it's effectively not operate my business or like I operate my business and assume that we're going to have some level of sensibility. And most likely, I think, over the next couple of years, legislation that then informs what regulators can do. And a lot of that is obviously premised on who the folks are, who are sitting in the key seats, the key legislative committees in Congress, obviously.
00:28:19.864 - 00:28:49.186, Speaker A: Well, I mean, since you brought it up, now, let's get into it a little bit. What is your take on this apparent. Well, I would say there's two things. There's a potential regulatory pivot that has occurred. That's what I've been calling pivot. Not about face, but most acutely illustrated by the apparent total lack of engagement by the SEC on the Ethereum ETF applications. And then sort of last minute, like three days before the final deadline was like, just kidding, everybody.
00:28:49.186 - 00:29:25.626, Speaker A: Get us your stuff. We're gonna approve them right now. And then they did approve them. Also, though, a big political, I would say, ground shaking in the politics of crypto assets with certainly with all of former President Trump's engagement with the industry, but also with those major votes, fit 21 SAP, 121 in the House and Senate for in the case, and then the subsequent veto, but more conciliatory language from the White House on the veto, on the fit 21 non veto. What's your take on this? Just overall? Is there a shift? If there is, is it just politics and not yet policy? How are you thinking about.
00:29:25.730 - 00:30:27.506, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm a clear example of the shift from a constituent perspective. So, lifelong Democrat, recently moved from New York City to Connecticut, registered as an independent, and I'm completely open minded politically, and I think you're seeing that across the country, an uptick in folks who are open minded about ideas versus parties. Now, what you read about in the mainstream media, having started the block, I know a little bit about media. It would make you feel like there's just two polar opposite spheres of folks in the United States. That's absolutely not the case when you start to have conversations with folks. But I do think that you're starting to see a really interesting, a really interesting shift. So what's happening is I think that the Democrats, surprisingly so, I voted for Joe Biden.
00:30:27.506 - 00:31:18.336, Speaker B: I'm not proud of it. I have pictures that I posted online of me drinking champagne and wearing a Biden hat. I hope somebody's gonna, when they see this, drag that out. But I deeply believed in at the time, this notion of liberalism, and I felt like, I've always felt like crypto is freedom technology that actually gives anybody access to the financial system, even if they're precluded from that by, call it the big banks or by intermediaries that exist, it should seem like the most democratic friendly, equal opportunity thing. So that was sort of my guiding mental model for why I could support Democrats. Okay. They view it as for whatever reason, the exact opposite.
00:31:18.336 - 00:32:58.666, Speaker B: Like, I think that the last four years, this Biden administration, with E. Warren as the proxy, but a number of others, even the squad, this notion that everybody who operates in crypto is wealthy is fraudulent and basically not looking at the technology on the face of what it can enable and actually is enabling as primary use cases like stablecoins, which you, you've talked about at length on this podcast and elsewhere, that empowering technology, but more as a political talking point, and then using basically enforcement action, really eager, deep, penalty oriented enforcement action dramatically against not. So the whole mission and mandate that Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman, talked about was protecting investors, but not going after the folks who were really, really taking advantage of folks in retail and fraud. I mean, the democratic politicians were meeting with SBF for years and taking his money, and then they dismissed his court case, and then they put Ryan Salami of FTX in jail and he donated the Republicans. But the point is, they basically did this thing where they went after the best companies, the best protocols, the most innovative projects, where I believe they knew they aren't going to win unanimously and decisively, but in an effort to paint an entire industry in a really, really negative way. And they did it with a cockiness and arrogance and a confidence that was tone deaf. And they're being smacked down.
00:32:58.666 - 00:33:58.104, Speaker B: And it's really heartening, I think, to see Americans not fall for the shenanigans. And you can see it in the health of the crypto markets over the last twelve months, just from a price perspective, developer perspective, and growth perspective. What's been interesting is Trump and his proxies and a number of republican leaders who I believe are excited by free markets, by access to markets who actually walk the walk on. Like, I want this person in my region who doesn't have access to banking to actually be able to set up a wallet instantaneously and hook into a global cheap payments network or financial network. They're actually walking the walk and talking the talk. And that's been the shift, and it's been incredible. And then Trump talking about it has changed the Overton window and forced now Biden to become a little more conciliatory.
00:33:58.104 - 00:34:03.036, Speaker B: I don't believe it. I don't think it's authentic, but it puts me in a tough spot.
00:34:03.060 - 00:34:46.346, Speaker A: As a lifelong liberal, what would you do now? If it is? You know, there's a meeting I saw reported Ro Khanna is organizing a sort of a democratic focused roundtable. Trump had a roundtable with bitcoin miners. There's clear whether or not it's durable. There's clearly some movement. Now, there's folks I know in the Senate working on some, I don't want to say it's not the same as fit 21, but a market structure bill theoretically could be. There's, I feel like a big dispute online in crypto, Twitter, and among others who are interested in politics about whether or not to use this moment where it's pre election and now both sides are sort of under pressure to do something, to get something done. I think we should.
00:34:46.346 - 00:34:50.898, Speaker A: Yeah. Versus wait and hope for a better Senate, House, White House.
00:34:51.026 - 00:35:36.154, Speaker B: So I think so. So my strategy would be, and I'm like, always focus, like as if it's a startup, just focus on the one thing that has the 80, 90%, you know, impact and then the other stuff will play itself out. My strategy differs from some of the folks I've seen. I've seen the folks who say, hey, and it's like the A 16 zs Coinbase, electric capital and others who seem to be like, hey, they're at the table, let's just get a bill done. It's better than nothing. I don't believe that, having read, frankly, the Senate's most recent draft of the bill, I don't think that's going to work. At the same time, I love Ryan Selkus as a friend, and he's been a competitor in many respects as the block.
00:35:36.154 - 00:36:52.794, Speaker B: I don't think the super aggressive yelling at people, by the way, I respect his conviction and I've been there at times myself. But I think it becomes a little risky when you're basically almost trying to publicly intimidate versus have a level conversation, a debate, and he had a great debate, a consensus with Marco Amore Uniswap. To me, that's the tone that you drive for, which is respectful of the other person and the fact that while you disagree with them feverishly, you do respect their ability to have a differing point of view. And I'm dealing with this myself, my liberal friends who think I'm nuts for saying, hey, I think Trump is actually onto something here. It deeply impacts not only me, my livelihood, my family, the ecosystem of founders and employees that we've invested in and the future of, I believe, like financial freedom in America. Hey, maybe I don't love at all. In fact, I dislike maybe the person who represents that.
00:36:52.794 - 00:37:28.360, Speaker B: But sometimes you have to understand we live in a world of marriages of convenience. So I'm taking that approach versus, so I'm somewhat in that middle versus going all in that I'm going to just run over everybody who disagrees. So the Ro Khanna thing, I think it's actually a really poor strategic move by the Democrats because everybody knows it's hollow B's. It's just a blatant and desperate reaction to the fact that Trump basically is courting all the republican vote money. I mean, all the crypto voting money.
00:37:28.432 - 00:37:50.676, Speaker A: Well, politics can make strange bedfellows. All right, let's move on because there's, and this raised something. Maybe this is a good transition. I saw supposedly, well, I saw reported by Mike Solana's pirate wires that Donald Trump is issuing his own, I guess, token. It's unclear if it's a meme token. I guess it is. I haven't looked.
00:37:50.676 - 00:38:29.688, Speaker A: Apparently there is one DJT on Solana and it would be spearheaded, quote unquote, by Barron Trump, also known as Lisa Nice. Is that, what's your take? So this is going to transition us. Let's talk about the markets in Solana. But I mean, as a transition here before the, the tech or the market, is that, I mean, Trump has sold NFTs in the past. Certainly people are raising money to donate to his campaign that are in the crypto market. Is this a legitimate and or will? And if it is true, it may not be true. It doesn't seem to me like he's confirmed to see it.
00:38:29.688 - 00:38:35.232, Speaker A: So I'm still a little skeptical. But is this something we're going to see going forward more? Is it something we should see?
00:38:35.328 - 00:39:34.406, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So I'm not involved. I have no idea if that particular token is legitimate. What's so interesting, though, is it kind of has a lot of the characteristics of meme coins in general, which is this great skepticism mystery. It's hard to figure out if this is the legitimate one. Every legitimate meme coin launched by a team, there's three others that are rugs with, with folks trying to frontrun it. It's a big, giant, fun and speculative arena, by the way, if you break out of that, and the ones that really do get to that next level, and there are ones like Bonk and Shib and basically can create ecosystems and have long duration, multiple years, integrate into the ecosystems they're a part of.
00:39:34.406 - 00:39:58.502, Speaker B: Bonk with Solana, Shib with Ethereum. So I think what we've seen lately, though, is more of a meta, of kind of like the social token and the social community token. I do think it's a better expression than the NFT communities. I mean, you've seen the top EtH NFT projects bored ape and pudgy penguins both went below nine eth today or 10th.
00:39:58.518 - 00:40:00.694, Speaker A: I didn't see that. I thought pudgies were doing well.
00:40:00.734 - 00:40:02.102, Speaker B: Yeah, I own gold pudgy.
00:40:02.158 - 00:40:07.044, Speaker A: You are pudgy regardless. I don't know if you still are. Yeah. But on Twitter, I know in some.
00:40:07.084 - 00:40:09.068, Speaker B: I've seen, I'm not changing it. I love it.
00:40:09.116 - 00:40:13.444, Speaker A: But you know, the apes are sub nine eth sub. That's crazy.
00:40:13.484 - 00:40:15.188, Speaker B: They're sub ten. I think they went sub nine.
00:40:15.316 - 00:40:22.316, Speaker A: So I mean, to be clear, I'm not a fan of the board apes. I think people who follow me know this, but I'm just saying, wow, what a fall.
00:40:22.380 - 00:40:31.676, Speaker B: So I think the original launch was great. And then what's tough with a lot of these is when you try to go beyond community into company. And they launched a dow and, you know, derivatives on the gym.
00:40:31.860 - 00:40:35.664, Speaker A: I saw that did not go over well. They raised an enormous amount of money.
00:40:35.704 - 00:40:41.160, Speaker B: Raised enormous on the money and then launched a token with a really sketchy lockup schedule and staking schedule.
00:40:41.232 - 00:40:43.240, Speaker A: Right. They also have the coin. Ape coin.
00:40:43.312 - 00:40:44.664, Speaker B: Yeah, that's where they ran.
00:40:44.784 - 00:40:55.048, Speaker A: And then also like, I don't know, we'll talk about this too. But like, video games, dude, so hard to make. So only people realize how expensive they are and how long they take and how rarely they're good.
00:40:55.096 - 00:40:55.280, Speaker B: What?
00:40:55.312 - 00:40:59.670, Speaker A: Even when you put millions of dollars, they end up awful all the time. That's like their main thing.
00:40:59.752 - 00:41:17.186, Speaker B: What upsets me is the people who were running these projects knew that. And what they continued to do was make these promises while raising innumerable amount, like just massive sums of money, knowing that there was no plausible way or very unlikely.
00:41:17.250 - 00:41:22.778, Speaker A: Very unlikely. But you were making the point to go back that fungible tokens may be a better community driver than the NFT.
00:41:22.866 - 00:41:50.754, Speaker B: So I think so, but not in the, so you have to kind of like go in scales. Like it's like any other sort of creative or community thing. Like YouTube, right? There's Instagram, there's just so many creators, so many communities. We're now moving to that in tokens. And I would always advise, like the prudent person to just like, wait until these things like break out. Like a real community exists. And then if you think it's fun, like jump in with a little bit test.
00:41:50.754 - 00:42:12.344, Speaker B: But what's cool is there's liquidity on them. So like, you, unlike NFTs, for the most part, and there's a large token count so you can get in. In different sizes. I could be in for 100, you could be in for 10,000. But we can have a lot of fun interacting with the same people. And many of them have events like the backpack mad lads have events all.
00:42:12.384 - 00:42:15.584, Speaker A: Over, or the malady raves or whatever.
00:42:15.664 - 00:42:34.074, Speaker B: Exactly. So you can find your sort of culture and do it. But I do think fungible tokens paired with them, or, you know, I think it's a better manifestation of community because it's easier in or out. And, like, people, like, need liquidity. Like, if I buy into a social club, you know, I want to be able to exit.
00:42:34.154 - 00:42:38.538, Speaker A: Well, that's kind of like the promise of, I thought, like fractionalization, tokenization, like.
00:42:38.586 - 00:42:40.450, Speaker B: Yeah. So now we should get to real assets.
00:42:40.522 - 00:42:48.018, Speaker A: Yeah, let's. Well, let's talk about what else you're interested in. I mean, what, so six man ventures, though, maybe before we get deep. I mean, you're. You're a crypto focused VC, right?
00:42:48.066 - 00:42:48.694, Speaker B: Yes.
00:42:49.244 - 00:42:52.224, Speaker A: What are you interested in? What are you investing in these days?
00:42:53.444 - 00:43:27.622, Speaker B: We have $140 million fund. It's our second fund, and we invest across multiple ecosystems. While I love tweeting about Solana, we're not maxis. We invest in the Solana ecosystem, ethereum and ethereum. L two s, but we primarily, and then bitcoin. Our last two investments have been the bitcoin ecosystem, and we invest in applications primarily, or infrastructure, but it's really an application. We haven't invested in l one s or l two s as a thesis, and it's because it's part of our backgrounds.
00:43:27.622 - 00:43:46.330, Speaker B: We've all worked. I gave you mine, and my partners in the firm have started companies or worked with them. So the biggest problem right now is we have an incredible amount of capital, incredible amount of attention, incredible amount of speculation, but we don't have enough sticky things that people want to spend time doing.
00:43:46.502 - 00:44:03.474, Speaker A: I love that you say this, because one of my biggest criticisms of the, I don't know whose fault is the entrepreneurs, the VC's, the markets, but I've been saying this, everyone. No, no, I've been saying this for years, like, please, if you're a builder, build something people want to use. If you're an investor, please find something people want to use.
00:44:03.514 - 00:44:20.182, Speaker B: So what's wild is people are building some of this stuff, but then, oh, I'm building an app. They're pricing it at just insane levels, delusional levels, and being, well, we're going to launch a token. And I'm like, no, I don't want you to do that. Why don't we actually try to build this in a very fundamental way like a traditional startup would.
00:44:20.278 - 00:44:24.222, Speaker A: You're just using this blockchain infrastructure. It doesn't have to be part of the Amazon.
00:44:24.238 - 00:44:50.252, Speaker B: Yes. Investments like stepn we invest in at 15 million. Pump fund we invest in at 20 million. Like Ft. Like, these are incredible teams and companies that weren't focused on maximizing extraction but are like, hey, let's get capital and the right partners in so that we can grow an incredible business. And like, those, we just. There aren't enough people doing it.
00:44:50.252 - 00:45:09.328, Speaker B: And if you do that, you might feel like in crypto, nobody wants to like, dilute more than like 2%. There's just like this weird perception that VC's are bad or that, you know, it's sort of a shame and it prices people out from success.
00:45:09.416 - 00:45:36.082, Speaker A: But I mean, maybe it's because there's been so many tokens created, right? It's kind of, you know, like a. I mean, think about the 21 and 22 era. Like, in fact, since 2015, my research shows that 100 billion has been invested in startups by VC's. Now, not all of that resulted in tokens, but a lot of it did. Now you've got this giant pile of tokens. I was just looking at unlocks. It's not great.
00:45:36.082 - 00:45:37.266, Speaker A: Over the next couple of years.
00:45:37.290 - 00:45:37.934, Speaker B: Nope.
00:45:38.994 - 00:45:45.330, Speaker A: And you're sort of, sort of being like, well, I mean, a lot of these are for infrastructure plays. And you're like, well, how much block space do we need?
00:45:45.442 - 00:45:46.594, Speaker B: Modular infrastructure.
00:45:46.634 - 00:46:00.738, Speaker A: Right, well, that's the other thing I was gonna say. I mean, the hottest narratives like this cycle have been staking, restaking, liquid staking, modular. Da da. Again, that's more infrastructure, right. Where are the people want to use?
00:46:00.786 - 00:46:03.038, Speaker B: I'm now working with six providers.
00:46:03.086 - 00:46:06.314, Speaker A: Whether or not that's the right way, I'm saying, like, more apps, please.
00:46:07.734 - 00:46:30.702, Speaker B: Of course. But, like, it's terrifying to build an app when you're getting advice from, like, and by the way, I see it day in and day out, the advice from the supposed, like, mentors and VC's is like, we'll use them for Da, and, you know, use these guys for security, and it's nonsense anyway. I do. This is why, like, for most apps, I do prefer Solana because of that.
00:46:30.798 - 00:46:34.278, Speaker A: Simpler, unified monolithic stack.
00:46:34.366 - 00:46:40.966, Speaker B: Yeah, call it an integrated stack. I'll get in trouble. Mert will say monolithic will tweet me to zero if I go.
00:46:41.070 - 00:46:41.334, Speaker A: Fair.
00:46:41.374 - 00:47:14.542, Speaker B: But the whole point is an integrated stack, right? Now, given the usage of these applications. Solana hasn't gone down in 1516 months. Obviously, there was a slow period while there were some upgrades a few months ago, but right now, if you're building an app and you put it on Solana like pump, for example, you're not going to get massively bottlenecked by the throughput of the network. It seems like a great place to launch, by the way, I can also say that. And you've seen this with social tech, right? This new one, there's like, time fun today.
00:47:14.598 - 00:47:15.222, Speaker A: I just saw that.
00:47:15.278 - 00:47:43.308, Speaker B: Yeah, there's. And so I'm an angel investor in fantasy top. You've got friend Tech, you've got Farcaster. So each one, there are a couple different l two s that they're on, but those ones also don't have those throughput constraints. But what's interesting is they are more centralized, which is fascinating. No fraud proofs and centralized sequencers, the chains that they're on, than Solana itself. So look, we've just had this finger pointing thing back and forth.
00:47:43.308 - 00:47:53.132, Speaker B: My big thing, less finger pointing and more just, let's get these apps. I'm so delighted that time launched. I'm not going to use it because I don't want to give minutes of my time up for a few.
00:47:53.188 - 00:47:56.276, Speaker A: You're not trying to financialize your five minute coffee break?
00:47:56.380 - 00:47:58.540, Speaker B: No, but I think it's so cool. And some more of those.
00:47:58.612 - 00:48:14.308, Speaker A: Yeah, more actual application uses. That's really interesting. I want to ask you about, you mentioned that some things may be starting to be built on bitcoin more. Are you interested in involved in the bitcoin as a platform sort of resurgence?
00:48:14.436 - 00:49:03.472, Speaker B: Yeah, so I am. But it takes time. So basically, bitcoin was obviously the first asset I bought. I was a quasi maxi for a while, not quite to the degree of a lot of folks, but I never believed that bitcoin would actually move to a point where you'd be able to change. I didn't think it would happen so fast. I'm so impressed with folks. I would say you, Eric Wahl, Dan held so many other, countless other Nick Carter who were able to get folks around this mindset of, hey, if we're literally just using this as money that we hide under our bed, that's not the be all, end all to me.
00:49:03.488 - 00:49:10.320, Speaker A: It's more like it doesn't have to be the be all, end all. I have no problem with. If you want to leave it to your grandchildren, which I do.
00:49:10.432 - 00:49:23.078, Speaker B: The primary use case, literally. That's so I don't like. So my strongest belief still is that bitcoin as the best money in my lifetime. That's the thesis. That's why I, you know, but it.
00:49:23.086 - 00:49:23.982, Speaker A: Could be used for other stuff.
00:49:24.038 - 00:49:40.742, Speaker B: So. And I think that's great. So where we're investing is, okay, well, then, if that's going to work. So we're not investing in any bitcoin l two s. I don't. And certainly not in stuff that's like building on top of a specific altitude, because that's like risk on risk.
00:49:40.798 - 00:49:43.790, Speaker A: Are you seeing some of those already apps for the l two s?
00:49:43.822 - 00:49:44.568, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:49:44.726 - 00:49:46.540, Speaker A: They haven't even really launched, like, perp.
00:49:46.572 - 00:49:50.068, Speaker B: Dexs on l two s that don't exist, that are being on Bitvm.
00:49:50.116 - 00:49:51.980, Speaker A: That's like, still not totally ready.
00:49:52.052 - 00:49:54.244, Speaker B: Exactly. So I'm like, risk on risk, on risk.
00:49:54.284 - 00:49:54.908, Speaker A: That's interesting.
00:49:54.996 - 00:50:50.798, Speaker B: But what we're doing is looking at things like an RPC provider, thinking about new ways to order transactions, looking at somebody who might use bitcoin funding as a way to launch a stable coin open Delta is a company that we backed to launch a bitcoin stable coin. And so experiments like that, that will work regardless of what l one protocols or l two protocols. See, transaction volume, I think, is really interesting. I'll say this at the highest level, and please don't ask me a deeper question, because I don't have the answer, but I do think bitcoin defi will look different than ethereum defi or Solana defi. If you're just bringing the same old perp dex to a bitcoin l two, why? You could say, okay, asian whales have a ton of capital, but no, it's very easy for them to move that through their centralized exchange to an ethereum.
00:50:50.886 - 00:51:01.742, Speaker A: Yeah. Similarly, I talk about ordinals, and I am very interested in the ordinals and runes, actual token standards and their usage.
00:51:01.798 - 00:51:02.554, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:51:03.414 - 00:51:10.072, Speaker A: I have an ordinal. It's 10,888. Check it out on your favorite ordinals explorer. It's my own avatar. I unscrew it.
00:51:10.088 - 00:51:11.004, Speaker B: Oh, I love it.
00:51:11.504 - 00:51:39.514, Speaker A: I think it's very interesting. But I would say for, like, tokens, I mean, gosh, ethereum's purpose built for that. Like, should we really be forced feeding it into that, into Lannig, but ether? Yeah, exactly. I don't think it, but I also don't think it harms bitcoin. If it did, if it jeopardized bitcoin as, say, the shorthand of digital gold, like truly jeopardized it. I think it'd be reasonable for bitcoiners to wonder whether something should be done to make sure it doesn't jeopardize that. I don't think it does, though.
00:51:39.514 - 00:51:46.090, Speaker A: So to me it's like now this is pretty much fine for everyone, if anybody. If anything, it's good for long term security and miners and all that.
00:51:46.122 - 00:51:54.266, Speaker B: That's what I think. So I'm excited about it because it's generating fees that, you know, like the fee picture looks a lot different than it did 15 months.
00:51:54.290 - 00:51:55.034, Speaker A: It really does.
00:51:55.154 - 00:51:59.214, Speaker B: And that doesn't mean, by the way, these are the things that people are going to be doing.
00:51:59.834 - 00:52:06.010, Speaker A: I don't think anyone, I don't think you will really hear a lot of people say that BRC 20 standard is like the future of tokens.
00:52:06.042 - 00:52:14.504, Speaker B: And by the way, even the runes standard, it's extremely difficult. Like if you want to launch a yield bearing stable coin on runes.
00:52:14.584 - 00:52:15.296, Speaker A: So hot right now.
00:52:15.360 - 00:52:19.600, Speaker B: Yeah, so hot. But like it's very difficult. You can't programmatically pay out.
00:52:19.632 - 00:52:22.288, Speaker A: Well, the mini smart contracts are really possible. Yeah.
00:52:22.336 - 00:52:31.960, Speaker B: So, so we, there's so much. But the cool thing is by trying it, yeah. You learn what those limitations are. And so that's been my most, like.
00:52:31.992 - 00:52:41.698, Speaker A: Most about the bitcoin. And this resurgence of bitcoin being used as a platform is just that you have a bunch of fun, weird people trying fun, weird things and there's, who knows what will come out about this.
00:52:41.746 - 00:53:16.796, Speaker B: And the L two, it probably looks really silly to us. Like, and some of them like Bob is like an EVM L two. Like I have no idea if Bob built on bitcoin is going to migrate like their plan is to. I hope so. But you know, I think arch is really interesting because they're doing it all one and they're saying, hey, like we're willing to encourage applications that the block time, ten minutes or whatever, 40 minutes, it doesn't matter. I love that there's so many experimental, there's going to be a lot of burned capital, but there's going to be a lot.
00:53:16.850 - 00:53:25.264, Speaker A: There's a lot. One of my analysts, Gabe, said that there were 50 and then I think our venture team was suggesting there's 100. Somebody said there's more than that.
00:53:25.344 - 00:53:28.368, Speaker B: We're close in on 200 venture funded.
00:53:28.416 - 00:53:35.696, Speaker A: You know that we're doing some research on this, but at current block sizes and let's say a lot of them want to be or are going to be ZK roll ups.
00:53:35.720 - 00:53:35.992, Speaker B: Yep.
00:53:36.048 - 00:53:50.600, Speaker A: Yep. We're doing some math on this. But I don't think that more than like one or two even sequencers will actually be able to afford to post because the amount of data is only four megabytes total to use per block. And like, some of these need like 600 to 800 kb.
00:53:50.672 - 00:53:51.192, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:51.328 - 00:53:53.808, Speaker A: So there's actually not space.
00:53:53.896 - 00:54:03.640, Speaker B: This is gonna. It will be aetherium, you know, 21 or 19. It'll be like, well, now it'll be cryptokitties time. Yeah. And we're a cycle away, which is, again, why.
00:54:03.672 - 00:54:31.140, Speaker A: And they'll be like, they'll be like, you know what happen is if this really catches on and they're causes fees to go, they'll be like, you know what, we should create a separate space where those were, you know what? Let's call them blobs, though. We could create a blob space. It'll be like proto day. Because I've been making fun of the Ethereum developer. Not really personally or anything, but that proto dank sharding on Ethereum is actually quite similar to segwit on bitcoin, which is. Wait a second. If you do a certain type of transaction, you get a reduced fee.
00:54:31.140 - 00:54:37.864, Speaker A: That's basically what they both are anyway, though. Yeah. That one or 200. I'm very unlikely to be that many.
00:54:38.524 - 00:54:53.450, Speaker B: Oh, no. It's going to be like four, five, six. It'll be the same thing as what happened with Ethereum. And then once you saw the 456 successful ones, now we're back to 200. And those 456, the prices are going down.
00:54:53.522 - 00:55:09.546, Speaker A: I love it. I want to ask you about the block before we go. You founded the block. Were you founder and CEO? I remember this. You built it pretty big, but then you left. I'm trying to. Maybe you can correct me here, too.
00:55:09.546 - 00:55:37.438, Speaker A: But then, so was that when McCaffrey took over, and then he did a round to buy out the cap table so that it became private or employee owned, quote unquote, which I thought was really interesting at the time. But what's the story with the block in your mind? Of course, just. I guess I'll finish the TL doctor here. Of course. We now learned later, we later learned that Mike McCaffrey got the money to do that buyout from SBF, a loan from FTX or from Sam. I'm not sure exactly what.
00:55:37.486 - 00:55:39.110, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I think it was one of Alameda.
00:55:39.142 - 00:55:57.054, Speaker A: And now, and then finally this now. And I give a lot of credit to Larry and the other folks that were there that they weathered this big period. They've now been acquired by an exchange. So that's whole thing here.
00:55:57.474 - 00:56:02.650, Speaker B: So one of the wildest experiences of my life. So it came into the ecosystem. I told you late 2017.
00:56:02.682 - 00:56:05.602, Speaker A: Well, I was gonna say you came from payments in general and you went media.
00:56:05.698 - 00:56:34.914, Speaker B: I was like, every time I ask a question and I get an answer, I have ten more questions. So I don't think I can be a VC. I don't think I can go build a protocol. I'm not an engineer. Why don't I, like, create something that can educate people that's independent? And so started the block and was so fortunate. Like, I'm outgoing, I'm out there. Like, I was public, but I was able to recruit Frank Shaparo, Steven Doja Toshi, and Larry Cermak.
00:56:34.914 - 00:56:39.570, Speaker B: So all just wonderful, incredible people who, by the way, are still building the box.
00:56:39.602 - 00:56:40.586, Speaker A: I know. They're so dedicated.
00:56:40.610 - 00:57:10.724, Speaker B: They had incredible success. Those guys are the heroes. They are absolutely best in the world at what they do and so loyal and dedicated, the people who work with them, not to me, to the people who report. So, so amazed with them. Anyway, so started this thing, and it's crypto, and I'm a passionate mofo. So we were doing. I was fortunate again to hire people who are doing hard hitting journalism or research.
00:57:10.724 - 00:57:27.580, Speaker B: I remember argymbology, who's a paradigm now, Teo Lebowitz, who's at uniswap, some of our earliest researchers, they're putting out heaters, like, hot, hot, intense research. And it really woke people up, and we got credibility pretty instantly. And then, like, I leaned into that.
00:57:27.612 - 00:57:30.860, Speaker A: We, Frank had scoops. Now he's called the scoop, but Frank.
00:57:30.892 - 00:57:40.436, Speaker B: Was really reporting, really, you name it, like, just b and b and binance having a Shanghai office. When they said they didn't, that was.
00:57:40.460 - 00:57:51.744, Speaker A: One of the, that resulted in one of the greatest memes. Right, which is recommend no more stories like this for your sake and the industry and the business recommend no more stories like this from.
00:57:52.244 - 00:58:21.604, Speaker B: It was wild. So. And then they put a bounty on us, he and Justin sun. So anyway, and, like, I don't back down from that. And then, like, we were going after, you know, coindesk and this and the other thing, but, like, we felt like we were on a crusade in an industry that proved itself, you know, in that 2021 era to have some major issues. So in 2022. So the thing that I learned, though, is, and you see this, there's some main characters going around.
00:58:21.604 - 00:59:09.494, Speaker B: We talked about a little bit, you know, recently, there's always main characters. And you can't run a publication while, like, putting yourself in that seat. And, you know, that's just the kind of person I am. So I basically decide after about three years, to transition out of the CEO role. And I elevated our COo, who I'd elevated a few times, Mike McCaffrey, to the CEO role. It's the first time I've ever dealt with a narcissistic sociopath. So somebody who will truly look you in the eye and just tell you something and sort of a long period of, like, you know, a long con sort of thing, where they will gain your trust and, you know, hey, they'll get to know your wife, and they'll get to know this, that and the other thing.
00:59:09.494 - 00:59:36.248, Speaker B: Anyway, so, bottom line is, this guy convinced me that if I sold it, I cared so deeply about these employees, if I sold the block, he would increase everybody's equity by many multiples. You know, Larry would get four or five x the equity. Frank would get the same anyway, so. And that the money was coming from his very wealthy parents. Okay. Turns out. So, anyway, I sell the company.
00:59:36.336 - 00:59:39.816, Speaker A: That's what we all kind of assumed was that he must be independently wealthy.
00:59:39.880 - 00:59:42.208, Speaker B: And by the way, his dad runs one of the largest pension funds, so.
00:59:42.216 - 00:59:43.160, Speaker A: He is independently wealthy.
00:59:43.192 - 00:59:43.408, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:43.456 - 00:59:44.056, Speaker A: We assume that's what.
00:59:44.080 - 00:59:53.568, Speaker B: This is unnecessary. It's just like, you know, this is. These types of folks, like, that's. They, for whatever reason, they do things that you're like. That's irrational.
00:59:53.616 - 00:59:53.936, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:54.000 - 01:00:02.400, Speaker B: So anyway, I sold it. He didn't give the equity of the employees. He then went on to borrow another $40 million or $45 million from SBF.
01:00:02.472 - 01:00:03.544, Speaker A: I thought it was only like the.
01:00:03.624 - 01:00:20.436, Speaker B: No, he borrowed $55 million. Company almost went out of business. FTX went down. He called me an hour before the press was going to run that they found out that we'd sold the company to FTX, and we hadn't. I had sold it to him. He had borrowed money from.
01:00:20.500 - 01:00:25.052, Speaker A: As a personal loan. Right. I mean, they didn't sell the company, but who knows what the terms are?
01:00:25.068 - 01:00:57.306, Speaker B: And then they got. So he lied to all the employees, never gave them equity. And then they. Fortunately, foresight Ventures, a really good group of folks like, I like them a lot, came in a few years later, reached nine months ago, cleaned up the cap table, bought out that debt that was owed to the FTX estate, which got paid off. And Larry, Frank and Stephen and Tim Copeland and the entire team, who have been just, I think, the best in the business amongst insane, insane pressure just continue to execute. Like, they have my utmost respect for them.
01:00:57.330 - 01:01:09.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I know those guys. They're incredibly loyal and dedicated and really, they really have been through, I mean, like everybody in this space, like us, they've been through the market alone as a ringer and then, yeah. To go through that whole thing.
01:01:09.822 - 01:01:17.838, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, and I think everybody, like McCaffrey, he's trying to make his way back in. He's one of those guys, probably doesn't need to be in the industry.
01:01:17.966 - 01:01:31.530, Speaker A: Well, Mike, I really appreciate it. I think what you're doing at six man, it sounds like you have a pretty interesting and different approach than other VC's I talked to, so that I always find that fascinating as a researcher.
