00:00:00.640 - 00:00:13.610, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.610 - 00:00:17.582, Speaker A: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.686 - 00:00:19.370, Speaker B: All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.670 - 00:00:20.358, Speaker C: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.454 - 00:00:39.080, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto else. Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. Bitcoin, not zero. I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy. Thank you for listening, as always, we have a great show for you today. Chris Ryan, head of liquid active strategies at Galaxy Asset Management, is our guest.
00:00:39.080 - 00:01:12.420, Speaker A: We'll talk with Chris about his career, how he came to Galaxy and got into crypto, what he does at galaxy. We'll talk to him a little bit about his work with the FTX estate, and some other interesting stuff. We'll also check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. This is a little spicier, longer one with bimdhennae. You know, we're getting into some interesting stuff. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into the show.
00:01:12.420 - 00:01:18.968, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:19.144 - 00:01:20.536, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:01:20.728 - 00:01:30.510, Speaker A: What's happening? You know, I'm not really sure what's going on in markets. Obviously, we've had a correction in bitcoin, lower, I think, since we last spoke. But broadly, what are you following right now?
00:01:31.090 - 00:01:59.212, Speaker B: Fixed income markets. We've had a little bit of a retracement in the inflation narrative. Things were easing over the past couple of months and people kind of got lulled into thinking that inflation was kind of under control domestically and abroad. And now you've had two back to back g ten economies print higher than expected CPI. If you had canadian CPI yesterday or earlier this weekend, you had australian CPI last night.
00:01:59.316 - 00:01:59.876, Speaker A: Both were hot.
00:01:59.948 - 00:02:12.212, Speaker B: Both were hot. And that caused fixed income markets to sell off. In addition, you have dollar yen breaking through 160, well, through intervention levels and stuff.
00:02:12.236 - 00:02:16.676, Speaker A: Yeah, I was gonna say it wasn't 140, like an important level along 150, etcetera.
00:02:16.748 - 00:02:26.510, Speaker B: Yeah, but now, yeah, you're through 160 and you are in uncharted territory, at least over the past 1020 years or so.
00:02:26.550 - 00:02:28.742, Speaker A: The Japanese, the largest holders of us.
00:02:28.886 - 00:03:40.058, Speaker B: Bonds, one of the largest holders of us bonds. There's a lot of Twitter chatter about all these real money accounts in Japan that are now going to be forced to sell some of their fixed income holdings because they're so underwater on their portfolios. But, yeah, it seems like the evolution of Japan is kind of moving towards more of a monetary policy response rather than just outright currency intervention, which I think would be bad for bond markets if you had japanese rates rise and they're a large money center for Asia as well. So if those funding rates start to go up, that should have reverberations into the bond market globally. But high level, we had a lot of good data in the US, and bonds repriced pretty aggressively. But when you think about it, how much can the Fed really cut? I think they should cut because there's a lot of signs that the labor market's cooling and inflation is fine. And so I think it's appropriate to cut, but I think the cut probably gets you to go to 4% if you're going to cut.
00:03:40.058 - 00:04:08.156, Speaker B: But even then, I've gone back and forth because the data is just so unpredictable, as we saw with Canada and Australia. And if you look at certain high frequency things, like, I think Jim Bianco tweeted out a photo of TSA and flight things of us folks, you're at all time highs in terms of tons of flying happening, tons of flying activity. So it's a really hard picture.
00:04:08.188 - 00:04:22.454, Speaker A: It's kind of like chopflation, right? Chop flation, basically. It's not really trending in either direction. Sometimes it looks like it's getting better, then it looks like it's getting worse. Luckily, it's not getting dramatically worse yet. It's not really reflation yet, right?
00:04:22.502 - 00:04:43.350, Speaker B: It's not, but it's, you know that, like, the moment the economy starts to turn and we start easing a little bit, that the reflation stuff comes back. And so I'm like, so hard. And so in my head, I'm like, really? The one thing you're not supposed to own is, like, back end us duration, like, yeah, seven years and greater.
00:04:43.430 - 00:04:44.414, Speaker A: You don't want the long bonds.
00:04:44.462 - 00:05:05.758, Speaker B: You don't. You don't. It's just like, there's not much value there. It's like inflation is gonna average anywhere from, like, two to, like, 5%. Right. And so your return above inflation on being in that paper isn't great. And to be honest, basically every other asset class has outperformed fixed income for a while now.
00:05:05.758 - 00:05:49.420, Speaker B: And so it's like, why put your money in something that's negatively real yielding when you have alternatives? I really don't like the back end of the us curve right now. That's my take. And then bitcoin, I am not that constructive on a move higher in the near term. I think upside is limited. I think that there's a catalyst in terms of the presidential debate that's happening this week. And if you do get some crypto mentions, I think you could get a little bit of a short squeeze. But in terms of the supply that the market has had to absorb, it's pretty nuts.
00:05:49.760 - 00:05:53.220, Speaker A: You have the Germans, the Germans coin, they've been selling.
00:05:54.960 - 00:05:57.448, Speaker B: Some flows out east as well.
00:05:57.584 - 00:06:00.260, Speaker A: You have the ghaks coming up, Gox coming up.
00:06:01.080 - 00:06:28.642, Speaker B: When the headline hits of billions of dollars of bitcoin being transferred to people and to exchanges, like that's going to cause the market to move lower. And I think 60k held because there's a lot of short covering and people are tactically like, that's a good level. But I saw a chart last night. I don't know if it was good or not, but in terms of BTC balances held by OTC desks, it shot up a lot recently.
00:06:28.746 - 00:06:30.754, Speaker A: Yeah, those charts, that's like glass node data.
00:06:30.802 - 00:06:32.538, Speaker B: Usually it's tough.
00:06:32.674 - 00:06:47.790, Speaker A: Yeah, we know they don't cover, but for inflows, I think it's a decent marker. It's more like for balances, it's like, I'm pretty sure not one of Galaxy's wallets is on that list. But like, people are sending coins to OTC desks. I mean, if you see it, even if they just track one.
00:06:48.170 - 00:06:52.234, Speaker B: And you know, you've also had outflows out of the ETF's most days.
00:06:52.322 - 00:07:14.136, Speaker A: So what do you think? You know, I've been writing about Mount Gox, right. And just on that specifically, I would say the argument I've been making is not that there won't be selling, or that it isn't a lot of coins, but that it's a. They're more diamond handed than people think and they're more. And there's less coins, I think, really available to actually be sold from there than the news stories. They say 9,000,140,000.
00:07:14.208 - 00:07:22.472, Speaker B: No, but at the end of the day, even if it's 1 billion, that's a lot of supply. To take down at the lows in the market when it's already taking down a lot of supply.
00:07:22.576 - 00:07:26.216, Speaker A: Yeah. My whole argument has been not that it doesn't go down, but that it's.
00:07:26.248 - 00:07:27.848, Speaker B: Not going to be as bad as I think.
00:07:27.984 - 00:07:37.360, Speaker A: So if the market overreacts, then you could look at that as a buying opportunity. But it is going to hit, and that probably is going to. There will be net new supply coming on for sure.
00:07:38.620 - 00:07:58.624, Speaker B: It's a tricky market, but, yeah, I think the way the market's positioned, at least in the option space, is kind of how I'm thinking about the market. That Q three is most likely going to be very supply oriented, and that in Q four, you'll have a broader rally as you get more.
00:07:58.712 - 00:08:01.648, Speaker A: Quite common in bitcoin world, too, if you look at the seasonality.
00:08:01.704 - 00:08:10.220, Speaker B: The seasonality. But that's what the options market is pricing in terms of, like, we're December volume. So end of December upside is on a relative basis.
00:08:11.320 - 00:08:22.624, Speaker A: You're talking about supply, too. Outside of bitcoin, at least we know we're talking about sort of unlocking seized supply or bankrupt supply in the case of Gox. But the altcoin space, the altcoin space.
00:08:22.672 - 00:08:24.288, Speaker B: Is infinite supply, and there's a lot.
00:08:24.304 - 00:08:25.248, Speaker A: Of it coming unlocked.
00:08:25.344 - 00:08:26.120, Speaker B: A lot of it.
00:08:26.240 - 00:08:33.404, Speaker A: Projects that raised in like 21, they're finally getting. They were on, like, literally three year cliffs. And that's now.
00:08:33.532 - 00:08:39.532, Speaker B: No, exactly. But here's the thing. You said it best. I think you put together the information, it's like $20 billion in crypto.
00:08:39.556 - 00:08:47.652, Speaker A: VC's, crypto, liquid hedge funds, liquid hedge funds, total aum, 20 billion, $80 billion of unlocks in the next two and a half years. Who's gonna buy them?
00:08:47.796 - 00:08:51.076, Speaker B: You know, and so the supply story is really gonna catch up to the market.
00:08:51.148 - 00:08:51.800, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:52.140 - 00:08:52.880, Speaker B: And.
00:08:53.260 - 00:09:21.832, Speaker A: Well, especially if the demand side hasn't really come here yet. We don't see the retails aping into the mag seven person. They're not aping into dogecoin, they're not aping into bitcoin, as far as we can tell. And then if the liquid asset management sector in crypto is only 20 billion total, it can't take down that supply either. We're coming at VC's, created a lot of tokens.
00:09:21.936 - 00:09:24.510, Speaker B: It's magic. Internet money out of thin air.
00:09:24.680 - 00:09:26.190, Speaker A: No proof of work at all.
00:09:26.970 - 00:09:47.586, Speaker B: No, fair enough. There's a lot of good things happening in crypto. There are, for sure, phenomenal. But in terms of the valuations, it's very tough to wrap your head around, because I believe in tech and the adoption will be there, but not everything can be worth a billion dollars.
00:09:47.778 - 00:09:48.546, Speaker A: Right out the gate.
00:09:48.618 - 00:09:59.438, Speaker B: Right out the gate. It's insanely hard to build a billion dollar business. Yeah, but how many billion dollar protocols do we have that make like $5 million a year, if that?
00:09:59.494 - 00:10:07.574, Speaker A: Yeah, not many. In fact, we were looking at of the top 20 coins, like on coinmarketcap.com, by, which obviously includes stable coins and stuff too.
00:10:07.622 - 00:10:07.806, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:07.838 - 00:10:38.658, Speaker A: I think only five are the result of venture capital. So you've got $100 billion since 2015 invested in the crypto ecosystem by venture capitalists. According to our research, not all of that went into token projects, but of that, I mean, probably thousands of tokens created out of that money, and only five are in the top 20. Right. I remember saying, like, where is that value? Token VC'S? Like, where? Where is that value? Right. And I mean, right. Ethereum, not venture back.
00:10:38.658 - 00:10:48.490, Speaker A: Right. Ico, right. Cardano up there in the top ten. I don't think it's a good project, but not venture back ico. Right? Like Dogecoin fair launch. Bitcoin fair launch. Right.
00:10:48.490 - 00:10:50.274, Speaker A: Stable coins don't even really count.
00:10:50.442 - 00:10:51.514, Speaker B: They don't. They shouldn't.
00:10:51.562 - 00:10:53.154, Speaker A: I'm saying, like, what is. Show me.
00:10:53.242 - 00:10:53.730, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:53.850 - 00:11:06.722, Speaker A: It's basically like Solana and like Avalanche and a couple others that actually have venture money that are actually in the top 20. It's very few, like, so it's also like, guys, please invest in and build stuff people actually want.
00:11:06.826 - 00:11:15.756, Speaker B: Realistically. I mean, the thing people want is like a blockchain that solves security concerns and that's scalable and that's fast.
00:11:15.828 - 00:11:16.508, Speaker A: Fast and cheap.
00:11:16.564 - 00:11:29.748, Speaker B: And like, they, you know, that's the Holy Grail. That's the Holy Grail. And there's a couple of them that are like, you know, going to be very close to, like, visa level, like TPS and things like that. But how many of them do you need?
00:11:29.844 - 00:11:30.372, Speaker A: That's the other thing.
00:11:30.396 - 00:11:32.076, Speaker B: And like, what is the value of that network?
00:11:32.148 - 00:11:32.908, Speaker A: And this is the whole.
00:11:32.964 - 00:11:34.716, Speaker B: It's like, so, it's so hard.
00:11:34.748 - 00:11:44.314, Speaker A: That's the whole thing. Like, how much block space do we actually need? Right, like you've got a ethereum and its l two s. Yeah, I mean, if the l two s, if that really long term works, how many other blockchains you really need?
00:11:44.362 - 00:11:45.530, Speaker B: We don't really need that many.
00:11:45.570 - 00:11:46.470, Speaker A: I don't think so.
00:11:47.010 - 00:11:49.550, Speaker B: How many bitcoin l two s do you know launching?
00:11:49.850 - 00:11:53.154, Speaker A: We got some stuff. We're putting out on this. I don't want to. We'll save this for a later episode.
00:11:53.242 - 00:11:53.786, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:11:53.858 - 00:12:08.294, Speaker A: Well, I think we think there's 65 minimum that have fundraised or announced. Right? Like, I don't think bitcoin can support, I don't mean the market. I don't think bitcoin, the network will be able to really house more than like two or three of these things. And that's if they have the money.
00:12:08.342 - 00:12:10.174, Speaker B: To actually skyrocket, though.
00:12:10.262 - 00:12:25.678, Speaker A: Exactly. So tricky. But yeah, agreed. I mean, I think a couple. I think Solana has been interesting to me because at least it's different than the ethereum ecosystem, like, technologically, but like, how many alternatives to eth is there room for? Right.
00:12:25.734 - 00:12:26.046, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:26.118 - 00:12:35.580, Speaker A: Especially if you get all these different roll ups that have different features. Like, why do you really need another blockchain or should just be a roll up? I'm not sure. But anyway, people are still creating those new blockchains.
00:12:35.660 - 00:12:38.028, Speaker B: I know. We'll see, but. Yeah.
00:12:38.164 - 00:12:39.356, Speaker A: Well, interesting.
00:12:39.428 - 00:12:41.260, Speaker B: There are consequences to printing money and.
00:12:41.260 - 00:12:51.348, Speaker A: What it just seasonally in the summer too. Right. We're about to end, like next week is July 4. We're really entering like the height of the summer now. It's going to be just weak. Right. Markets.
00:12:51.348 - 00:12:59.940, Speaker A: What do you think? I mean, stock markets are open. Crypto markets are 24/7 but, you know, they say, like, selling May and go away. Like. Yeah, there's typically, like, low volume in the summer.
00:13:00.060 - 00:13:03.236, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's really tough.
00:13:03.268 - 00:13:05.100, Speaker A: It is leading into a presidential election, though.
00:13:05.180 - 00:13:05.604, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:05.692 - 00:13:06.852, Speaker A: So there's gonna be some excitement.
00:13:06.956 - 00:13:34.036, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. It's really tough to call. I think that there's gonna be less staffing than usual across the street, but outside of that, it's really tough. I think equities, they've rallied a lot. And so folks are going to look at earnings and be like, show me that you're still doing well. Show me that you're still growing.
00:13:34.068 - 00:13:35.700, Speaker A: You're not overvalued and all that.
00:13:35.740 - 00:13:39.588, Speaker B: But I don't even know if people care about value right now. It doesn't make much sense.
00:13:39.644 - 00:13:44.884, Speaker A: And we're likely to have the Ethereum spot ETF's launch perhaps in the next few weeks.
00:13:44.932 - 00:13:45.828, Speaker B: Next two weeks. Yeah.
00:13:45.884 - 00:13:51.240, Speaker A: So that could cause excitement. I mean, I know people are kind of bearish on that.
00:13:52.580 - 00:13:53.968, Speaker B: It's not going to go well.
00:13:54.084 - 00:13:54.752, Speaker A: You don't think so?
00:13:54.816 - 00:13:57.072, Speaker B: People have not had enough time to market the product.
00:13:57.136 - 00:14:05.072, Speaker A: True. But, like, there was no real bitcoin marketing on like, day one. Yeah. Although it did have a nice, like, drumbeat for months leading into it.
00:14:05.096 - 00:14:11.992, Speaker B: Yes. You had Larry Finko on tv about it. Right. Like, there's the marketing behind ads on newspapers, television.
00:14:12.056 - 00:14:12.536, Speaker A: That's true.
00:14:12.608 - 00:14:23.884, Speaker B: Right. It doesn't have the same marketing, and it's also just the worst product. And so, you know, and everything we've known so far is that, like, crypto is a buy. The rumor, sell the news event, and.
00:14:23.892 - 00:14:25.916, Speaker A: Even the bitcoin ETF's were in the beginning. Right.
00:14:25.948 - 00:14:43.680, Speaker B: We had a strong bitcoin futures ETF was a buy. The rumor sell the news situation, the spot ETF was that the ETH futures ETF was the same thing. And so I don't see anything different. The only thing different this time is you might not actually rally going into that.
00:14:44.420 - 00:14:54.696, Speaker A: We're not really rallying now. So to me, it's like, the one thing I would say is that I feel like it might being bearish on the east ETH ETF's is actually like kind of consensus.
00:14:54.808 - 00:14:55.216, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:55.288 - 00:14:58.816, Speaker A: And I think that I don't. That might be middle price action.
00:14:58.928 - 00:15:02.880, Speaker B: It went from like a two handle to like, no, no, high threes, almost four.
00:15:03.000 - 00:15:11.816, Speaker A: True. Well, that's true. But I mean, like, now everyone's like, oh, they're gonna. So they're gonna. Even on a relative basis, they're gonna underwhelm the bitcoin ETF's. Right.
00:15:11.888 - 00:15:15.872, Speaker B: I think the trade is really in the ETH ecosystem thereafter.
00:15:15.936 - 00:15:16.240, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:16.280 - 00:16:17.964, Speaker B: Right. So you have eleven $10 billion, $11 billion of ethnic that goes from being idle ETH to potentially redeemable ETH that can be used in the ETH ecosystem. It can be used to stake farm on DeFi, et cetera. And I think the ETF opens the door to more investors looking at DeFi in a more critical way and from an investment perspective. And like, how should I really be thinking about ETH? And so what I really like, if I had to trade anything from the long side going with ETF, are the DeFi protocols. Interesting stuff that are actually valuable from the sense that the tokens you had Uniswap turn on the fee switch or propose to turn on the fee switch, you've got protocols like maker Aave and compound that make real revenues and that trade at multiples that are, let's say, 20 ish, maybe like somewhat reasonable. Depends on how you want to think about it.
00:16:17.964 - 00:16:23.196, Speaker B: But these are companies or protocols that trade at reasonable valuations.
00:16:23.308 - 00:16:24.396, Speaker A: And they actually have usage.
00:16:24.468 - 00:16:26.908, Speaker B: They actually have usage multi chain.
00:16:26.964 - 00:16:48.798, Speaker A: So you're thinking that the ETF say, wait a second, let's learn more. Creates an educational thing. And then actually, people say, well, not that I should buy the ETF. I should get real ETh and maybe do some of this real stuff, or, like, on chain. Yeah. To me, it's like, if you're gonna be the world computer, you don't wanna, like, take the keys or the gas or the whatever for the world computer and lock it in a vault. You want to plug it into the wall.
00:16:48.798 - 00:16:54.078, Speaker A: So, to me, I've never liked this idea about the ETH, whereas most bitcoiners are really hodlers, and they think of.
00:16:54.094 - 00:17:06.022, Speaker B: It like digital gold, so ETh, you should be using it and, like, figuring out stuff to do. And so, yeah, I'm optimistic for, like, the rest of crypto and, like, people figuring out what to do with stuff.
00:17:06.086 - 00:17:18.546, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I'm not sure yet whether we're going to record next week, because it will be July 4. But thank you so much, as always, my friend Bimnett, for coming on, and maybe we'll see you next week. If not, we'll be back after that. Everybody.
00:17:18.658 - 00:17:21.750, Speaker B: Brilliant. Thanks for having me. Have a good July 4, folks.
00:17:23.890 - 00:17:28.514, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Chris Ryan from galaxy Asset management. Chris, welcome to galaxy Brains.
00:17:28.602 - 00:17:29.514, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:17:29.602 - 00:17:44.060, Speaker A: I'm excited to have you because you haven't been on before, but you've got some really interesting stuff going on at galaxy. We're going to get into that before we do. Crypto is a time warp. How long have you been at galaxy? It feels like two years.
00:17:44.220 - 00:17:46.844, Speaker C: A little over two years. Almost two and a half years now.
00:17:47.012 - 00:18:00.268, Speaker A: Well, gosh, it's been too long. I'm happy we finally have you on here. What do you do at galaxy? And then I want to throw in some of your backstory to it. How'd you get to galaxy? Everybody has a weird one. It's a pretty young company still.
00:18:00.364 - 00:18:22.880, Speaker C: It is. So at galaxy, I run our liquid active strategies dedicated team that's focused on really investing right now in a liquid crypto fund, and my team's also responsible for the FTX liquidation. And we have a number of other interesting projects that we're working on as well that we should be able to talk about.
00:18:22.920 - 00:18:25.448, Speaker A: Yeah. And where were you before galaxy?
00:18:25.544 - 00:18:43.074, Speaker C: Before this, I was at Conan steers for ten years. I ran a global natural resources fund. I was a co pm on a listed infrastructure fund, and I was head of strategic equities, which was kind of a broad group of thematic equity strategies. In digital infrastructure, global logistics, etcetera.
00:18:43.162 - 00:18:47.550, Speaker A: Natural resources, like what? Timber, oil, water. Do people trade water?
00:18:48.050 - 00:18:54.914, Speaker C: They like to buy water linked equities, but they probably do that more through infrastructure companies than natural resources.
00:18:54.962 - 00:19:01.150, Speaker A: So, like, I was gonna say mining companies, I guess, you know, mine drilling companies, like water plant companies.
00:19:02.020 - 00:19:08.988, Speaker C: There are some, yeah. You could find water companies in infrastructure. In mining, they're usually big water consumers, not water producers.
00:19:09.044 - 00:19:13.748, Speaker A: That's what I mean. Whatever the mining is in water, I guess it's pumping. Is there pumping companies? Yeah, you can.
00:19:13.844 - 00:19:14.920, Speaker C: Industrial companies.
00:19:16.380 - 00:19:45.532, Speaker A: Let's talk about. We're going to talk about the crypto markets with Chris. A fair amount, obviously, as he said, he manages liquid active strategies. So there's, I'm sure you've got plenty of views on, directional views on the markets and different coins, or different segments of coins. We'll get into that. But you mentioned the FTX bankruptcy. I think our listeners will know that Galaxy has this mandate to advise the FTX estate on, I guess mostly disposing of the liquid assets to raise cash for the creditors.
00:19:45.532 - 00:19:49.076, Speaker A: What can you tell us about that? That's you and your team that does that work?
00:19:49.188 - 00:20:24.690, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think it's well known that the bankruptcy court has established that FTX has to return cash claims back to creditors. So FTX has been working with us and with a number of parties to essentially locate the assets and work on selling those assets, converting them into cash to get that prepped up to send back to creditors. So we've been focused and what's publicly announced in the liquid token space, we also worked to sell the trust assets.
00:20:25.550 - 00:20:28.126, Speaker A: You mean like the GBDC or whatever else? Yeah, those things.
00:20:28.158 - 00:20:28.510, Speaker C: That's right.
00:20:28.550 - 00:20:29.018, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:29.134 - 00:20:38.390, Speaker C: And more recently in what we call hard to sell assets. So some of those could be locked tokens or other types of tokens as well.
00:20:38.690 - 00:20:45.970, Speaker A: They had a lot of random tokens. Right. How many different tokens do you know? Hundreds.
00:20:46.050 - 00:21:06.862, Speaker C: Well, you could take a look at their wallets and you would see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tokens. And it's not so easy where you're just trying to sell Chainlink. You're trying to sell Chainlink across twelve different chains which are non native. So can you bridge those back? Is it difficult or can you just sell those on the non native chain?
00:21:06.926 - 00:21:28.198, Speaker A: Gathering that. Oh, wow. I'm doing all the work to figure out where you could actually get. Just using link as the example. If I have link on some obscure l two, is it even liquid enough there to work to sell? It's not just, I guess they didn't deliver you a nice, clean fireblocks account with all the coins is what you're saying. That's not how it worked.
00:21:28.294 - 00:21:41.830, Speaker C: You know, in equities, it was very simple. If you owned bank of America, you own bank of America, right. Crypto, it's a little bit different. You think you own bitcoin, but you own bitcoin on whatever chain that's on.
00:21:41.870 - 00:21:42.990, Speaker A: Wherever Sam had it.
00:21:43.070 - 00:22:00.382, Speaker C: Each one has its own distinct contract address. And if you go to a counterparty and you're like, I want to sell you bitcoin, and you try to deliver them bitcoin that's bridged to the arbitrum chain, they're going to be like, this is not what I thought I was buying. You need to deliver bitcoin to me on its native chain.
00:22:00.526 - 00:22:09.918, Speaker A: That's tricky. I don't think. Just not that you were implying this, but Sam, pretty famously, FTX, they didn't have any bitcoin, did they? Not really. Right.
00:22:10.014 - 00:22:14.390, Speaker C: They had. Well, there was bitcoin recovered, like, a sizable amount.
00:22:14.430 - 00:22:31.950, Speaker A: I just remember this is one of the things that people, when FTX was collapsing or right when they collapsed, people started finding their wallets and stuff and being like, I don't think they really have any bitcoin, which is just. They had a bunch of serum, a bunch of solana, and a bunch of FTT.
00:22:33.530 - 00:22:40.226, Speaker C: Yeah. Those assets, for sure. Bitcoin, they had a decent amount of bitcoin, but it was not the largest by far.
00:22:40.298 - 00:23:06.570, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you say what the largest? I mean, I think people know that Solana had a lot of Solana. In fact, the resurgence of Solana, which maybe we'll talk about in a minute, because people thought that chain was dead because of how integral a figure Sam was in that ecosystem. Of course, to be clear, I'm talking about Sam Bankman, Frieda. I guess I'll say his full name at least once. So when I say, sam, what were the biggest assets that have been recovered? I should say liquid assets.
00:23:07.990 - 00:23:18.496, Speaker C: I probably can't really get into too many details, but there was a substantial amount of a number of assets. Again, you can see these on their wallets. You know, they have a lot of.
00:23:18.528 - 00:23:25.860, Speaker A: The same coins, but going down to hundreds, though. I mean, was it like power law? Like, a couple were most of it. And then, like. Or is it a nice.
00:23:26.280 - 00:23:36.616, Speaker C: So there was a. I would say probably when you look at it, you know, a large majority of the assets were held, probably in the top 100. And then you've got kind of a long tail.
00:23:36.688 - 00:24:00.908, Speaker A: Long tail, it sounds like. Very cool. I just saw, I don't know the details on this, but, like, I saw a report that there's a vote that's eventually the plan, the final plan or something is going to be put to a creditor vote soon. So, gosh, these people might finally have an end to this saga, at least, which is great. Cool that galaxy gets to play some constructive role in trying to clean up this mess.
00:24:01.044 - 00:24:35.354, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And there's all sorts of different complaints out there that we wish we had the crypto, but just the way that, I think customer accounts were essentially not even really segregated that well, and assets were all over the place. The ability, I think, and the complexity of doing that would have been so immense that if you think Mount Gox from 2014 to today is a long period, this would probably be a process that lasts 50 years. So most people wouldn't even be around by the time they finally figured out where those at came from.
00:24:35.442 - 00:24:45.034, Speaker A: And you guys, to be just clear for the audience that you're not designing the bankruptcy process here, your mandate is specifically to help deal with these liquid assets, right?
00:24:45.082 - 00:24:45.482, Speaker C: That's right.
00:24:45.546 - 00:24:50.234, Speaker A: Per whatever John Ray and the people like, whatever they've agreed to or been approved by the court.
00:24:50.282 - 00:24:50.442, Speaker B: Right?
00:24:50.466 - 00:24:50.978, Speaker A: It's not.
00:24:51.074 - 00:25:16.440, Speaker C: Yeah. And for as much flak as I think the attorneys get for the fees they've charged, they have been able to recover a substantial amount of assets, and assets that probably many people didn't even know, people that FTX knew were even on the balance sheet. So in one way, they've kind of paid for themselves and being able to really source some of this just lost and hidden crypto as well.
00:25:16.520 - 00:25:37.058, Speaker A: Incredible that you're just involved both from galaxy, but personal. I mean, this is one of the biggest, or maybe even the biggest bankruptcy of all time. I forget it's very high. I mean, the guy, John Ray, the CEO of FTX, now, he cleaned up Enron. This is the real deal when it comes to crazy bankruptcy unwind. So I don't know. I mean, it's pretty historic.
00:25:37.154 - 00:25:37.730, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:37.850 - 00:25:43.458, Speaker A: Not just for crypto. This is a bigger story than inside the crypto markets only having just worked.
00:25:43.474 - 00:26:03.054, Speaker C: In investment management, really getting kind of the inside scoop on how this whole process works. It has been an enlightening and just an incredibly intelligent thought process for me to really see this and to understand all of the complexities that are taking crazy well.
00:26:03.182 - 00:26:13.718, Speaker A: I'm gonna be happy. I'm sure I'm not alone and being happy that this saga will come to an end at some point. I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure how soon, but another important step happening soon, if they approve the. Whatever.
00:26:13.814 - 00:26:14.838, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely.
00:26:15.014 - 00:26:46.186, Speaker A: All right, let's move on. I wanted to ask you, too. I saw. I think so this just yesterday, I think, Galaxy announced that there's a partnership between Galaxy Asset management and State street to launch managed ETF's that will invest in, I don't know, a variety of strategies. I'm not sure. Maybe you can or maybe you can't say, but will also hold, like, bitcoin, Eth, ETF's along these strategies in my mind, and I really don't know, but maybe it's like crypto equities and also bitcoin and ETH or something.
00:26:46.298 - 00:27:24.742, Speaker C: So my team will be working on that. And I wish I could comment more outside of the press release, but unfortunately I can't. The one thing I would say is I think it's just another good sign of continued institutional interest in investing in the crypto ecosystem and doing this through equities as opposed to through tokens or through venture. It's just another avenue that investors can really find that exposure. For us who believe in crypto going forward, more and more equities should become public, and that pool of opportunities and investments we can make is just going to continue to grow.
00:27:24.806 - 00:27:41.610, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's true. Especially if there's any type of material change in the way the SEC is operated or the control of the SEC. I think you'll see a lot more. Very interesting. I know that I would like those, personally. I mean, I'm looking for interesting ways. There are some interesting passive ones today.
00:27:41.610 - 00:28:21.240, Speaker A: I don't know of any active ones yet, so that's pretty exciting. All right, so let's talk about crypto in general. A little bit like, again, if you have a mandate from a bankruptcy to figure out how to most efficiently dispose of that requires some important thinking and knowledge. But separately, if you're trying to manage a portfolio of cryptos that you want to earn money on, you must have some pretty well thought out views on crypto. I don't know what. Maybe we'll just start not necessarily as a pm, but how do you think about bitcoin? Is it digital gold? Are you bullish on bitcoin, Chris?
00:28:21.580 - 00:29:00.862, Speaker C: Personally, I'm very bullish on bitcoin for just a number of reasons. And I think where everybody who's investing in bitcoin really needs to just kind of get a grasp on things is we need to get away from this mindset of thinking of it like a gambling market and a get rich quick market. To me, bitcoin, and I know Mike says this a lot, it's a generational asset. And when you look at what younger investors want to invest in, they don't want to invest in gold, and many of them don't invest in equities. I have an analyst, and I don't think he's ever bought an equity. He's only bought crypto. Crypto to him is an investment.
00:29:00.862 - 00:29:45.220, Speaker C: And as you're well aware, even in the Asia Pacific region, they would prefer to invest in crypto than in their local equity markets. So you've really got this whole new investor base. And just the unique thing about bitcoin, not everyone in the world can buy Nvidia. Being based in the United States, we're very lucky that we can access us stock markets with our brokerage accounts and we can put it in order and we can buy a couple shares of Nvidia. But somebody sitting in the Philippines who has a couple bucks for them to be able to access that, it's just impossible. You have to be very wealthy or very well connected. Bitcoin is very different.
00:29:45.220 - 00:30:35.272, Speaker C: It's one of the most accessible investments that an investor can make. And when I think about just the long term potential for asset accumulation into bitcoin, and more people thinking about bitcoin as a store of value or as a way to really even get dollar exposure outside of their existing regime, all of those things just really resonate with me. But it doesn't happen overnight. I think many people, they shouldn't have this mirage view that if they invest in bitcoin, they're going to wake up next week a millionaire, not what any investment is supposed to be. I think about this much more as kind of, this is going to be a fantastic investment over the next ten years. So personally, I'm a big bitcoin investor, and I think it's going to be an asset that's around for a while.
00:30:35.336 - 00:30:58.468, Speaker A: So how do you think about now? And I'm not just going to go down the list of coins by market cap, but I mean, I totally agree with you, obviously, on bitcoin. And it has kind of a unique, certainly has a unique. It is unique among the cryptos, obviously, it was first, it's a fair launch. I'm not going to go through them. Our audience knows. It has a different kind of feel to it. It feels almost like a geopolitical macro asset at this point.
00:30:58.468 - 00:31:45.750, Speaker A: I don't think any have crossed the chasm to join it there. But let's talk about Ether, because it's obviously the second most valuable and we think we're on the cusp of getting spot Ethereum ETF's. In fact, I just published that we, me, Galaxy research thinks that they could start trading as soon as the week after next. So like July was that, 12th, 11th, 12th, whatever that week is so going to be more and more in that conversation, I think, because now all the things that the bitcoin ETF has in terms of accessibility and distribution that wasn't previously available is what is Ethereum to you? And this is a little different. I think not a lot of people have a straight answer on this. Is it a world computer? Is it a bitcoin competitor? What is it?
00:31:46.110 - 00:32:09.510, Speaker C: I mean, the one great thing about Ethereum is when I talk to institutional investors, or even high net worth investors, everybody knows what bitcoin is and everybody knows what Ethereum is. However, if I go into those meetings and I talk about Cosmos, they're just spinning their heads. They don't really understand.
00:32:09.670 - 00:32:15.200, Speaker A: What do you say if you have to talk about that, it's kind of another ethereum, but it's slightly different.
00:32:15.280 - 00:32:23.184, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a different architecture and it's a different way that it works, but they try to kind of do the same thing. At the end of the day, what.
00:32:23.192 - 00:32:31.168, Speaker A: Is that thing that they're trying to do? This is for ether 100. Is it a web3 platform? Is it an Internet bond? How do you think of it?
00:32:31.304 - 00:33:07.844, Speaker C: I think of it as a massive global accounting system. It's a store of record, like kind of a big data accounting system where it doesn't just have to be a certain 010101, but you can put all sorts of different data into it and that'll be recorded and it's completely trustless and it's stored on the blockchain for all to see. So to me, that's kind of what ethereum is in terms of how I think about it. I did read your report, luckily before I came, so I'm somewhat educated sizing the market.
00:33:07.892 - 00:33:10.888, Speaker A: We can talk about that too. Yeah, we'll continue though.
00:33:11.084 - 00:33:40.500, Speaker C: But I think Ethereum benefits from name recognition. That is one of the best things that it has going for it, particularly when you get outside of maybe the audience that's listening to this right now, and maybe to those second tier investors that are still just trying to get familiar with what crypto is. And personally in my journey too, bitcoin was number one, Ethereum was number two. Yeah, makes sense just how you go down the line.
00:33:41.180 - 00:34:00.852, Speaker A: Know, if it was the first ICO, it might have been. I think it was up there. I can't recall things like Mastercoin did an ICO or whatever, but yeah, it makes sense. I mean this was the, it was also sort of the first like general purpose kind of blockchain, right? Yeah. And it's the second most valuable. So it makes sense in a lot of ways. You know, I kind of struggle, but it's interesting to hear.
00:34:00.852 - 00:34:30.490, Speaker A: We'll talk. You mentioned talking to investors about Ethereum. It does definitely have brand name recognition. Not as big as bitcoin, but second biggest. It's meaningfully different from bitcoin, right? I mean it's taken different decisions from design, roadmap and even design style. Also functionality. I would say one of the areas they're similar is in the view that and a pretty strong view both have that a layered approach is the way to scale.
00:34:30.490 - 00:34:48.920, Speaker A: Does the emergence of generally now running pretty well for a while, the Ethereum l two s, the optimisms and arbitrums and base. How does this impact your, is this good for Ethereum? Is it inevitable? Is it accretive?
00:34:49.260 - 00:35:47.032, Speaker C: You know, I've tried to think about this, you know, a million ways and I kind of think of, I've tried to come back to this whole analogy and I don't even know if it makes sense anymore. Wherever you've got the Visa network and Visa is processing all of these transactions, but you have all of these different banks that issue their own Visa card. So you could have hundreds of banks that are all issuing Visa cards. And then users of those Visa cards can go to any store that they want to and use those transactions and the issuer bank will get whatever they have and the visa will get whatever they have. I kind of think about these L2s as being those issuer banks, but at the end of the day, there's no value to those cards. If visa, the network doesn't exist back.
00:35:47.056 - 00:35:48.024, Speaker A: As the layer one.
00:35:48.112 - 00:36:36.398, Speaker C: Right. I know so many people try to value Ethereum based on revenues and what that potential fee rate is, but at the end of the day, really, there's a massive intrinsic value there too, that if it didn't exist, well then none of the other stuff would exist either. So I try to shy away from thinking too much that L2 s are kind of sucking the value away. But what I would say in the near term, just given the number of L2s that have really emerged. We've probably seen Ethereum investors kind of diversify into them. So it hasn't really allowed Ethereum to essentially see some of the big price response that you might have expected with kind of the new ETF and whatnot. Although we did see some good price.
00:36:36.398 - 00:36:51.206, Speaker C: But I think that's maybe why, prior to the ETF announcement, Ethereum had just been struggling a little bit to keep up with bitcoin, is because little bits of that was being shaved off, sent to some other areas.
00:36:51.278 - 00:37:07.350, Speaker A: So you mean less the argument that the transactions on the network are moving to the l two s, less that being suppressing to EtH price, and more even the tokens for those l two s attracting some investment that would otherwise have just gone to Ethan?
00:37:07.420 - 00:37:49.950, Speaker C: I think so. The way I think about it, too, when I run into my portfolio is I think of, we run everything with a beta to bitcoin, a beta to EtH and whatnot. What you tend to see is that L2s tend to have a beta to Ethereum, that tend to be a little bit higher. So let's say that we've got Ethereum and we'll just take optimism, for example, and it runs at a beta of 1.5. Well, I could take, let's say, 1% of Ethereum, and I would only need to buy a small amount of optimism to get that same beta to Ethereum. So from a capital efficiency standpoint, does that free up a little bit of extra exposure that I can put into something else interesting?
00:37:49.990 - 00:37:59.502, Speaker A: So it's almost like you get the same exposure, but with slightly higher beta. So that could also harm the specific ETH investment directly into that eth token.
00:37:59.566 - 00:38:14.934, Speaker C: Well, that's why I'm just curious if other investors have been doing something similar to that, where they can get proxy ETH exposure through the L2 sdHe, but because they're higher beta, they can move some of that extra capital if they want to be in bitcoin, if they want to try another foreign equities, for that matter.
00:38:14.982 - 00:38:15.382, Speaker B: That's right.
00:38:15.446 - 00:39:05.194, Speaker A: So what do you think about the ETH then? I mean, the report that you're talking about, it's on our website, and we don't go. So we did the one for bitcoin, sizing the market for bitcoin ETF, where we made a prediction on net inflows, and then a prediction of what those inflows that we predicted would do to bitcoin spot price. Similarly, here we made a prediction about net inflows. We don't actually get to an ETH spot price prediction. But we read a lot about the general thing that we say is that we think it could be more sensitive to movements because it's actually more of it's locked somewhere than bitcoin, particularly a third of it's in staking. It's pretty sticky there. You're not going to take it out of staking where you're earning yield, although really new issuance, you're earning rewards to then put it in an ETF that doesn't have rewards.
00:39:05.194 - 00:39:29.962, Speaker A: So that's not coming from there. There's a bunch of it locked in Defi. It's probably not coming from there. We said base case, they could be about 30% as see about 30% the net inflows over the same time period that the bitcoin one did. In the end, that's actually relatively naive. That's basically market cap weighted. That puts us on a little bit of a higher range than others I've seen.
00:39:29.962 - 00:39:41.930, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on the. When I say success, I don't mean performance of these, what will be liquid equities, I mean of the flows. Like, do you think we're going to see big flows or bigger or smaller than we saw for bitcoin? What do you think?
00:39:42.010 - 00:39:55.682, Speaker C: Yeah, so unlike bitcoin, the staking element is like a huge wild card out there. I've talked to a number of just friends and they're like, no way would I ever move my ethereum over to an ETF.
00:39:55.706 - 00:40:03.970, Speaker A: So you're talking about like 300. I mean, it changes depends how much at stake. But like in the 300 to 400 bps annually that you'd be leaving on the table if that's a mistake.
00:40:04.050 - 00:40:55.086, Speaker C: Yeah, I think where you will see ETF flows. So prior to the ETF's, the way that most investors, larger investors, were getting exposure without doing it directly through a coinbase or Gemini or something, was doing it through a private fund structure. So those private fund structures, of course, are going to be much higher fee rate than the ETF. So you could see a big rotation there. What we also saw is that with bitcoin, there was a flow from Canada, and that moved into us ETF's because you had us investors that were actually buying those ETF's because they weren't available in the us. So you'll see some of that flow come back then. Clearly there's probably a number of other retail investors wherever, they just never actually opened up a wallet, or they did.
00:40:55.118 - 00:40:59.766, Speaker A: But they have money in a. They could use the brokerage window or an ira.
00:40:59.918 - 00:41:41.300, Speaker C: That's right. Or they've rolled over one of their iras and they're stuck investing in stuff they don't want to. I think there will be flows. Trying to handicap that number is so difficult. But my guess is very similar to what was published, is that it's going to be far less than bitcoin. Even the institutional investors I speak to, when we talk about some of the institutions that are a bit further along than others, it's more of an 80 20 split. Bitcoin Eth for other institutional investors, they haven't even gotten to bitcoin yet.
00:41:41.300 - 00:41:55.168, Speaker C: For institutions, of course, they move a little bit slower, but if we kind of use that 80 20 or maybe a 75 25, you'd be talking about a quarter to a fifth of the flows.
00:41:55.224 - 00:42:30.520, Speaker A: That makes sense. That's kind of what we said. Although, like I said, 30. I mean, we said, I think, I don't know the other thing that I have when I think about this, and I totally agree with everything you said, and I agree that if I'm going to own ETh, I'm going to want to stake it. That matters to me. Some people have said, well, Alex, if, let's say it goes up 120%, are you going to be mad that you only got like 110%? And I'm like, okay, maybe not the way you say it, that way, but ETF's are largely held by financial advisors and other. If it's allocators and institutional investors, they're famously fee sensitive.
00:42:30.520 - 00:43:02.750, Speaker A: Right? So if you start looking at the lack of staking, like, okay, oh, they're going to waive the fees for the first six months, but you're actually going to lose 200 bps. Cause you're losing half of a year if you hold it for the first six months in non received staked rewards. Now, obviously, there's also operational reasons why they probably couldn't even stake all of it anyway, but to me it's materially different. But, yeah. Do you think that's if you are an allocator or an institutional investor and you're in the bitcoin ETF's, you think they put some into the market cap weighted into eth, too?
00:43:02.830 - 00:43:28.202, Speaker C: Absolutely. And I think some financial advisors, they won't advise client assets outside of brokerage accounts. They can't even put money into some of these wallets, or they can't put them into certain exchanges. So they haven't had an option whatsoever. So it's kind of like, yeah, maybe there's a slight disadvantage. But if I can't touch that in the first place, well, this is much better than nothing.
00:43:28.306 - 00:43:57.790, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. What about now? I am kind of going down the list. Solana to me, and by the way, we've written this, and I personally kind of believe this, we called Solana the third chain in our annual watch this space report. I think that the data shows that's true from things like DeFi, TVL and accounts and all this stuff. Certainly in meme coins, it's basically ground zero for. There were like 100,000 coins created a day at some point. It's crazy.
00:43:57.790 - 00:44:29.244, Speaker A: I've liked it because it is a meaningfully differentiated technology from bitcoin and ETH. Eth is nothing like bitcoin and Solana is not really like eth. A lot of the 2021 sort of alternative chains were basically ethereum clones, even avalanche, before they launched subnets. The c chain is basically an ETH clone, right? Phantom and blah blah. All these other ones were pretty similar. So I'm kind of like. Well, especially if Ethereum scales, I just viewed it as additional Ethereum style block space.
00:44:29.244 - 00:44:50.400, Speaker A: But Solana is different, right? If ETH is pursuing a modular stack, and we haven't even talked really about celestias and eigen layers and things like that, but broadly, a layered scaling and even modular stack, Solana is kind of eschewing that entirely. They believe in this monolith. That's what makes it interesting to me. And by the way, it has a lot of usage. How do you think of Solana?
00:44:50.980 - 00:45:04.510, Speaker C: I'm pretty optimistic on Solana. I think even with the recent announcement, the team there is really looking at how they can advance the usability of Solana. I think what would be just.
00:45:04.590 - 00:45:08.990, Speaker A: Oh, you're talking about this compression thing. That is that we're talking about this state compression.
00:45:09.110 - 00:45:13.654, Speaker C: No, this is the release they just had the other day where they have, what are they called? Actions or.
00:45:13.822 - 00:45:48.168, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I forget, I don't know, more functionality. There was a new thing that this guy Mert, I forget, I think it's Helios Labs. He's an important Solana developer too, where they can do state compression. State growth on blockchains an issue and they can compress. It's actually, I think it's very similar to utree xo to my bitcoin audience members. They might note Taj tridja again, basically just compressing the state, I think using basically Merkel trees. But I think here they're using ZK stuff anyway, that was another one, though.
00:45:48.168 - 00:45:55.168, Speaker A: Still, I agree. Plenty of advancement. They really are active in coming up with new ways to make it work better.
00:45:55.264 - 00:46:07.790, Speaker C: Yeah. The visa partnership really coming out in September last year seemed to time very well with people being like, wait, there is value here. Why would Visa partner with them if this was a dead chain?
00:46:08.890 - 00:46:24.880, Speaker A: It did. To be clear, this is one of the most craziest trades of 2023. It was at like $12 in the summer of last year and went to what, 180 as high as we've gotten? I think it's, the cycle got up over 200. It went over two.
00:46:24.960 - 00:46:25.152, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:25.176 - 00:46:29.752, Speaker A: I mean, that's more than a ten bagger in a few months. Crazy.
00:46:29.896 - 00:47:06.900, Speaker C: Yep. It was pretty big. You know, my personal view is that, you know, when we see kind of some of the distributions of FTX asset back to creditors, you know, what was one of the biggest assets that was on the platform? Solana. What do those investors want to buy back? SoLANA so you could see a bit of a buying event later this year if those creditors really see value in Solana and they really want to get in that ecosystem. I shouldn't troll crypto Twitter, but based on all of the crypto Twitter posts that I see, a lot of them like.
00:47:06.940 - 00:47:57.962, Speaker A: Solana yeah, one of the things we were talking about, too, and I want to ask you about investor sentiment. We talked a little bit about how you would talk about or deal with bitcoin and eth when dealing with an institutional investor. Plenty. Definitely still aren't looking, but it feels to me like they're not really back yet. Some are. We were talking, I've talked with people at top ten pensions for several years, and a few of them got pretty far, and so far even that maybe they lasted through the bear market, but they kind of stopped asking questions for a little while. Some of those folks are genuinely back, but most are like, maybe just now that I've seen and starting to get questions again, I mean, it's hard to ignore bitcoin's 160% rise from just year over year even, or whatever, whatever it is.
00:47:57.962 - 00:48:17.860, Speaker A: I mean, we're up almost, I mean, 16, five to start, 2023, 61k right now. It's hard to ignore that. So they are asking, but what's your sense of their interest and involvement level and timing? What's the thing we've used to say institutions are coming? Well, they came and kind of left. Some started. Are they coming back?
00:48:18.240 - 00:49:20.210, Speaker C: You know, last year it was dead. There was just absolutely nothing. We've had a lot more discussions and a lot more conversations with institutions that are doing homework again. And we've actually talked to some of the consultants as well. And even there, where their activity was essentially zero, they're starting to have more engagements with clients that are starting to snoop around again. I think it's probably still not necessarily this year, but I really think that next year we're going to start to see a lot more direct investment from institutions there. Some of them, maybe they've already put capital into the venture side with some of the regulatory easement that we're seeing on the liquid side, and just kind of some of the progress around Congress finally taking a bigger look at crypto instead of ignoring it.
00:49:20.210 - 00:49:28.598, Speaker C: All of that is very supportive because the number one issue we hear nonstop is the regulatory risk around liquid crypto.
00:49:28.694 - 00:49:46.776, Speaker A: Yeah. And that makes sense. I mean, there has been a lot. I think it looks like ETH has made it through the wringer finally. What was your take on that? I said, and I thought it really was a pivot. They seemed set to deny. And then, oh, they're like, oh, crap, within three days, you guys gotta guess everything.
00:49:46.776 - 00:49:56.328, Speaker A: Cause we're gonna approve. And then they did. On Monday, Eric Balchunis tweeted that they were upping their odds all of a sudden. And then on Thursday, they were all approved, I think the 19 b four.
00:49:56.344 - 00:50:15.440, Speaker C: S. Yeah, I wish I had a crystal ball to see what happened that weekend, because it was dead silence, and we're partnered with Invesco, with our own ETh, and we know exactly what the conversations have been. And up until Monday, there were zero.
00:50:16.260 - 00:50:44.820, Speaker A: It wasn't that they weren't constructed right. It was radio silence. I mean, I don't know. I would also love to know what precipitated that something happened. Yeah, I mean, I think it's objectively true that they shifted their behavior. They went from dead silence to incredibly urgent active. But anyway, so ETH looks at least, you know, for example, the 19 b four s approved Ethereum commodity based trusts.
00:50:44.860 - 00:50:45.480, Speaker C: Yep.
00:50:45.980 - 00:51:01.526, Speaker A: I think Chair Gensler still refused to directly say whether ETH was a commodity at a subsequent hearing in the Senate banking committee. But nonetheless, you can't put securities in a commodity based trust, legally speaking. So I think that case is pretty settled.
00:51:01.598 - 00:51:02.582, Speaker C: It should be, yeah.
00:51:02.606 - 00:51:15.302, Speaker A: And then I saw, too that the SEC, it's not a no action letter, but they sent sort of a non wells notice to the Ethereum foundation. Right. Or was it ethereum foundation or consensus?
00:51:15.326 - 00:51:21.126, Speaker C: I can't remember which they did. Consensus. I thought there was one for the Ethereum foundation. But that was a while ago.
00:51:21.198 - 00:51:40.050, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So they told them that they were stopping their inquiry into whether or not Ethereum was a security. So it seems like it's through, but that's still pretty much it, that we have very clear, positive clarity. And the SEC is still alleging that giant list of cryptos or crypto asset securities.
00:51:42.110 - 00:51:47.286, Speaker C: At this rate of speed, maybe by like 2050, we'll get through about 25 of them.
00:51:47.398 - 00:52:13.814, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think hopefully there's some kind of new process, whether from a change at the regulators or legislation. Right. I mean, there's. The Fit 21 act has very clear ways that tokens can a be launched or sold and also determined if they are or aren't a security. That would make it much easier to know and then you could develop, but that helps a lot. You think they're seeing that as increased regulatory clarity, these institutions? They're seeing that.
00:52:13.862 - 00:52:41.108, Speaker C: Yeah, they're definitely seeing that. And I think what's really interesting around the EtHTF, too, is just how quickly the follow on was with fit 21 and other comments that we heard coming out of Congress and then, of course, from presidential candidates and the president himself. So a lot of things kind of changed very quickly there, and it's definitely caught up in tension.
00:52:41.204 - 00:53:34.792, Speaker A: Yeah, even the, you had a very rambunctious veto threat issued by the White House on SAP 121. I mean, truly incendiary language, things like, and keep in mind, this is like a relatively arcane accounting rule that sort of, as a byproduct, affected banks. And they came out with a statement that said, like, this would cause financial instability and all this crazy stuff. And then fit 21, which was, is frankly a much more comprehensive and impactful legislation than overturning. This SEC accounting bulletin got like a, we look forward to working together and no veto threat. So I was like, that's to be like, I mean, they were kind of painting sab 120 one's overturn as if it was some kind of like apocalyptic scenario. And then the thing that would radically overhaul the CFTC and SEC's authority in this space, they were like, let's.
00:53:34.792 - 00:54:10.484, Speaker A: We're looking forward to working together. Yeah, that was in the span of two weeks that changed. I think those are the clearest markers to me. If you look at those two, what do they call them? I forget what they call statement of administration policy. Do you think we're likely to get, do you think it hinges on the election? Do you think it's gonna, or are we in a trajectory that becomes more positive in general? Or how are you thinking, just to be honest, too? I think the elections kind of outside of the Ethereum, ETF approvals and or launches. I think that's basically the next catalyst here. Election.
00:54:10.612 - 00:54:19.772, Speaker C: Yeah. I've become so, you know, put off by politics. I shouldn't probably talk about politics. I started watching House of cards again.
00:54:19.836 - 00:54:20.560, Speaker A: Oh, no.
00:54:21.100 - 00:54:23.020, Speaker C: But, you know, a lot of, you.
00:54:23.020 - 00:54:26.964, Speaker A: Know, what you need to do was watch west wing. That'll make you feel good about politics. Yeah, that's the good one.
00:54:27.132 - 00:55:12.380, Speaker C: What I. You know what I feel in politics, there's a lot of talk to really garner votes, and I would love to see that talk turn into action after those votes are cast and those candidates are sitting in their seats. Clearly, if they're not, then it's going to be a very short term for whoever those candidates were. Now, I'm not only talking presidential candidates, I'm actually talking some of the congressional candidates as well. But neither presidential candidate or president would really have, what do they have, four years? They can't do more than that. So it's kind of a one term kind of run.
00:55:12.460 - 00:55:32.444, Speaker A: Yeah. I also kind of think I tend to be someone who doesn't. I wish. I guess this technically makes me more of, like, a federalist, as in, like, states rights over the federal government's rights. But I'm just pretty sick of it, like, being apocalypse. Each side says that, like, oh, if the other guy wins, it's apocalypse. It's like, that shouldn't even be possible.
00:55:32.444 - 00:55:46.140, Speaker A: Presidents shouldn't have that much power. And by the way, they don't. This is this irony that, like, it's. They really don't have nearly as much power as the frenetic, like, media coverage of the presidential election always makes it seem.
00:55:46.220 - 00:56:00.268, Speaker C: Yeah. The problem is that the centrist kind of approach to government has been completely shattered. And you're either on this side or this side, and you either win or lose, and that's what just makes everything so apocalyptic, because if I don't win, it's apocalypse.
00:56:00.324 - 00:56:25.328, Speaker A: Yeah. Chris, you've had a long career in investment management and portfolio management. You came to galaxy. You're now trading cryptos. Sounds like with these, you may be trading equities as well that are interesting. But what made you do that change to crypto, to come in and take a chance? I mean, I don't know. Colleagues probably were like, oh, my God, you're going to do that crypto thing.
00:56:25.328 - 00:56:36.760, Speaker A: That's crazy. I think we've all heard that at one point or another. And as a caveat is sort of a last question. What makes you most excited about public blockchains? Bitcoin, eth, crypto, however you want to describe it.
00:56:36.880 - 00:57:36.950, Speaker C: Yeah, so actually, my old risk manager at my old firm, I remember he came into my office after I announced my resignation, and he was like, I really give you a lot of credit for doing this. He's like, you had a great job, you had a great career, but you're really taking a risk and just doing something that you really believe in. And for me, crypto, when I came over, and whenever I was even thinking about this, it was still being managed. There were a number of managers out there that had great pedigree, had been in investment management, but you also had a lot of these other small garage funds and whatnot. And what I saw really missing from the crypto investment landscape was really kind of an institutional kind of approach to investment management in crypto. And I think there's a handful of people that actually do it pretty well. But I think there's a lot of people that do it very poorly.
00:57:36.950 - 00:58:37.410, Speaker C: And it's not just kind of an institutional approach in dealing with clients. It's having risk management and having risk policies and having compliance and making sure from even a legal aspect that everything is kind of in line with, but an approach that from an endowment or a pension plan, when they would look at kind of running an odd process on you, they'd be like, these guys know what they're doing. And that's really why galaxy really was attractive to me, is because I saw what was built out here. I saw what the asset management team had done, and I saw kind of how they had really built and structured the firm. I think coming into crypto, yeah, it's a big risk to a pretty steady career, but at the end of the day, equities can get pretty boring. It's kind of the same thing every day. You've got 1000 sell side shops out there writing the same research.
00:58:37.410 - 00:59:33.880, Speaker C: Everybody's model is essentially taking company guidance and plopping it down, plus or minus a couple percent. And it just seemed so commoditized in crypto, it's still kind of more on the frontier. And there's so much opportunity. And for me, that structure of it is what creates the opportunity to really drive alpha. And the second volatility for me is something that drives alpha. When you have assets that can really overreact to the upside and the downside, if you have a very astute process on how you manage a portfolio, you can take advantage of those. Now, clearly, as I was trimming Solana Aethereze along the way last year, I felt dumb when it got up to 200, but that is the risk managed way to go about keeping a portfolio within these guidelines that any institutional investor would want you to.
00:59:34.580 - 00:59:42.028, Speaker A: Super interesting. Well, thank you, Chris. That's it. That's Chris Ryan from Galaxy Asset Management. Thank you so much, Chris, for coming on Galaxy.
