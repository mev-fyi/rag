00:00:00.640 - 00:00:13.594, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thornton. The us banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.594 - 00:00:17.566, Speaker A: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.670 - 00:00:19.354, Speaker B: All bitcoin's gonna be erased.
00:00:19.654 - 00:00:20.342, Speaker A: Bitcoin.
00:00:20.438 - 00:00:22.114, Speaker C: Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.774 - 00:00:43.550, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome to Galaxy brains. I'm your host, Alex Thorne. Bitcoin not zero down a little bit this week, no doubt, but we're still here. And we're back. We have a great episode for you. Merch from chain code labs will join us to talk about bitcoin fees, the mempool transactions, the future of bitcoin, also, how bitcoin is developed in the bitcoin improvement proposal process.
00:00:43.550 - 00:00:55.894, Speaker A: He and four others were just added as maintainers to the bip repository. It's quite interesting discussion. Of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading. As always. Big day today. Or fed day as always. We always.
00:00:55.894 - 00:01:14.366, Speaker A: Like these days. We'll get into it. Bimnet get his take before we get to all that, and he's reminded to please refer to linked disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information on this podcast constitutes investments, advice, or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Oh, man, Phineas, we're just, like, rolling on. It's practically spring. It's.
00:01:14.366 - 00:01:15.238, Speaker A: It's May.
00:01:15.326 - 00:01:23.550, Speaker D: It's crazy beautiful here in New York. Excited for another episode of Galaxy Brands. We are getting well into the hundreds now.
00:01:23.622 - 00:01:41.050, Speaker A: I mean, we have this new branding, too, and I still like it every time, you know, when we do this intro, you play me this. The static intro, and I'm kind of banging this track, dude. Like, I've got, like, I'm hearing Neil Cascari say, infinite cash to cash in my dreams now.
00:01:41.162 - 00:01:48.650, Speaker D: Yeah. Shout out to everybody for putting together that. And as well as the new branding, I think it looks great. Check us out on YouTube.
00:01:48.802 - 00:01:49.370, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:01:49.442 - 00:01:50.906, Speaker D: You know we're hot on YouTube.
00:01:51.010 - 00:02:11.322, Speaker A: Yeah, we're working on. We're gonna grow and build our YouTube presence, and I'm. This is the first Phineas has heard about it, but I'm proposing several new shows per week. I don't know if we can handle that, Cadence. I'm just joking. But there'll be more from us and shout out to studio friends for the awesome production work on this show.
00:02:11.418 - 00:02:25.968, Speaker D: Thank you. It's just so exciting how far we've come. We're putting out a lot of content, I think. Check out Christine's show the infinite jungle on Ethereum. And just so much going on.
00:02:26.146 - 00:02:39.052, Speaker A: Well, we have a good one. And we have a good one next week too, that we've already been working on. So hang in there. Check out our song with Captain Youth stealing time. By the way, it was at the end of last week's episode. I still like that song a lot.
00:02:39.068 - 00:02:43.668, Speaker D: It's stuck in my head, I'll be honest. I've been humming it, been jamming it, I've been listening to it.
00:02:43.676 - 00:02:45.660, Speaker A: It's great. Yeah, they call it printing money, but it's really fun.
00:02:45.732 - 00:02:47.276, Speaker D: We gotta build on. We'll build on that one.
00:02:47.300 - 00:02:59.368, Speaker A: Yeah. We're gonna have some more tracks coming out soon. Don't you fret. We'll be back with more music. But for now, let's get into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:59.496 - 00:03:00.800, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:03:00.992 - 00:03:13.844, Speaker A: Yeah, big day today. Fed day yet again. If you're watching on YouTube, you may notice I'm in Las Vegas for Microstrategy's bitcoin for corporations conference. Bimnet, you are on the ground.
00:03:14.144 - 00:03:16.404, Speaker B: You're there to gamble. No joke.
00:03:18.104 - 00:03:26.862, Speaker A: You're there on the ground in New York. What happened today? What did the Fed say? What's their policy? And what was your impression from Chairman Powell?
00:03:27.038 - 00:04:44.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say the big notable change in policy was with respect to the balance sheet management. They are now going to roll off a smaller portion of their portfolio every month. So in treasury world, they are going to reduce their roll off from 60 billion per month to about 25 billion per month starting on June 1. And so that is a pretty big deal in the sense that the Fed is anticipating that eventually they will need to stop the balance sheet runoff. And there's a little bit of a philosophical debate in the sense of, should you be cutting rates while engaging in hawkish balance sheet policy? And so this brings us closer to better alignment with respect to where we are in the monetary policy cycle. So I thought that was fairly notable. In addition to that, I do think Powell's kind of reluctance to meaningfully engage in a conversation about potential hikes was viewed pretty constructively by the market.
00:04:44.714 - 00:05:51.644, Speaker B: I think at the start of the presser, he basically started to list off a bunch of pieces of data that suggests that the economy is slowing in certain aspects. I would broadly perceive this FOMC meeting as being perceived as on the dovish end. And that is the reaction that you had in fixed income markets with the front end rallying anywhere from six to eight basis points. And so I think he struck a tone that acknowledged that further progress needs to be made on inflation. Just to give you an idea, maybe like six months ago, the talk was about supercore inflation, which is inflation services inflation, ex housing. The three and six month run rates on those figures right now are very, very elevated. In addition, you had really hot January, February and March CPI prints, PPI prints as well.
00:05:51.644 - 00:06:19.064, Speaker B: Broadly speaking, in the context of those hot inflation prints, you know, Powell was reluctant to really push back against hike chatter. And so ultimately, I think he was about as dovish as he could possibly be in the context of a very hot price environment.
00:06:20.284 - 00:06:47.822, Speaker A: Yeah. And I saw right after he spoke and during equities rallied, I saw at one point the indexes were up like one and a half percent or so on the day, and bitcoin rallied from. And we'll talk about bitcoin in a second. And then it looks like they, I was just checking the equities. I saw what happened in bitcoin. They mostly gave it back following it. So it was, this happens all the time, like either down a lot and then right back, or up a lot and then back, like.
00:06:47.822 - 00:07:05.984, Speaker A: But that instant sort of rally, brief rally in equities and bitcoin, probably a bunch of other stuff I'm not looking at. That must be the market's reaction to your point about that. He seemed about as dovish as he could be. But then sort of you take a breather and you're like, oh, well, it's like pretty much the same situation as an hour ago.
00:07:06.144 - 00:07:46.836, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And I think part of the reason for the sell off is that higher for longer is gonna pinch the economy. Right. You already have credit card delinquencies shooting higher housing is starting to look a bit shaky. I mean, I saw a map of, like, Denver homes for sale yesterday, and it just seems like there's a ton more supply on the market, whether that's from, you know, new homes that are being built or existing supply. There's a ton of housing supply coming on right now, and housing affordability is very low. And so there's a lot of supply into a market that doesn't have that many strong bids to it.
00:07:46.836 - 00:08:46.812, Speaker B: And so stuff is cracking there. And ultimately, I do think about inflation as a tax on the consumer. You go to the pump, you go to the grocery store, you pay rent, engage in normal activities, and if that's going to eat away at your marginal consumption, then it's going to be bad for the economy ultimately. And so I think what you're starting to see is just cracks in the us consumer. I'll give you some names. There's a large coffee company that was down 17 18% today on, on weaker than expected figures from Q one and probably bad outlook as well. There was also a healthcare oriented chain company, pharmaceutical chain company that was also down 18% today, again signaling a weaker consumer.
00:08:46.812 - 00:10:00.944, Speaker B: And so we are starting to see the effects of higher interest rate policy and tightening monetary policy flow into the consumer and consumption's 70% of the us economy. And so there's enough reason to be cautious about hiking rates or keeping rates higher for too long. And so what I really think the price action shows you is that while monetary policy being a little bit more dovish than expected, is good for risk sentiment, ultimately the real economy is kind of what drives earnings and what really matters. And the real economy is slowing right now, period. And so we just have to stay very vigilant because it slows, then it could start rolling over much more quickly, especially if you start to see the labor market move the other direction. But as of right now, we had a hot ADP print today that was higher than expected. I expect non farm payrolls to be high.
00:10:00.944 - 00:11:03.494, Speaker B: Employment cost index, Fed's preferred measure for wages, was also a strong beat at 1.2% for q one. There's a lot of weird things going on. Ultimately, I would say that what you're kind of seeing happen is a story of stagflation at the moment where inflation is becoming really hot and staying hot while overall activity is slowing. And ISM manufacturing today was the perfect kind of example where the activity indexes were weaker than expected, but the prices paid component of it was really hot. And so it just signals that growth is kind of cooling a little bit, but the price pressures are still there and it almost seems as if they're entrenched at the moment. And that's why the Fed can't really cut right now.
00:11:05.594 - 00:11:17.668, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes sense. I saw the IsM stuff. It's effectively manufacturers input costs are, aren't going down, but the demand to buy the stuff they output is basically. So it's like, yeah, and there's a.
00:11:17.676 - 00:12:02.824, Speaker B: Purpose and cost for producing the same goods are going up because the input costs are going up, but also the labor costs are simultaneously going up. So it costs more to produce every single unit and there's a little bit less demand for every unit. And so it's a very tricky place to be right now. However, ultimately, I think the Fed's main concerns, inflation is a real issue, but a growth slowdown and employment ticking much higher ultimately is a way bigger concern for the Fed. And so it's just so hard to balance. I think Powell's got probably the hardest job on the planet right now, or one of the hardest jobs on the planet.
00:12:02.924 - 00:12:03.152, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:03.168 - 00:12:42.834, Speaker B: And I would say that the brevity of the statement and the brevity of the press conference sort of underscores how uncertain these policymakers are with respect to kind of what they're going to do, because the data could really go either direction at the moment. I do think that the growth stuff is cooling and inflation will likely come down. It surprised markets pretty meaningfully to the upside in all of Q one. And so it's a very tricky place to navigate given kind of the volatility you've had in the data.
00:12:43.174 - 00:12:51.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I also want to ask you, but we don't have time today, so next week we're going to talk about this. But I want to talk a little bit about JPY.
00:12:51.654 - 00:12:56.990, Speaker B: And they just literally just got intervened on just now. It just dropped.
00:12:57.022 - 00:13:12.122, Speaker A: Oh, so they did it again today? They did it again. Yeah. Yeah. So they did it on, they did it on Monday. We'll talk about that. We don't have time because I want to get to the bitcoin and crypto price action a little bit here, too. Obviously, we're recording this on Wednesday, May 1.
00:13:12.122 - 00:13:41.434, Speaker A: Bitcoin's trading at like 57k ethers at this point, well below 3000. So it's a significant correction at this point. Whereas it sort of felt for the sort of, since we had those all time highs in March, it felt more like we're kind of near it, we're below it, but it's mostly chopping. We had run all the way back up to 68.69 at one point, but now we're meaningfully down. We're 22 by my count, 22.5% below that all time high of 73.8k.
00:13:41.434 - 00:14:11.934, Speaker A: That's a legitimate correction. There's been prior, I've published about this how in prior bull runs there have been many of these, but obviously macro sentiment, the s and P is down a decent amount also over this timeframe. How are you thinking about it? Either those two combined is it a macro thing? Did we just get overextended in our exuberance as all markets tend to when they're very excited? And what do you think about sort of the near path forward for bitcoin?
00:14:13.234 - 00:15:22.506, Speaker B: The short term path for bitcoin is tricky to figure out. And I would say that the things that I look at suggest that you're kind of close to a reasonable bottom. Historically in bull markets, you've had corrections of 20% to 30%. You're in that band right now and you're hovering around things like the 100 day moving average and a couple of support levels. And I think positioning has definitely shifted from folks being a little too long to closer to flat, a reasonable short basin in the market as well. And then on top of that, you've had a significant amount of overriding flow in bitcoin that has brought call skew a lot lower. Right here, right now, it definitely feels like a little bit of an oversold market that's hovering around supports and the macro environment doesn't seem great.
00:15:22.506 - 00:16:34.032, Speaker B: And so I still kind of feel like it's probably still in do nothing land. But for folks that are more concerned about the medium term and the bigger picture story, I still think that's intact firmly. So the fiscal situation in the US has not gotten any better. Right? And ultimately I do think risk markets rally into the election as we're probably going to get more spending no matter who's elected. And generally we do. Equity markets tend to do well in the back half of the year, Santa Claus rally, October, November, December, et cetera. And then on top of that, I do think that the 13 f filings in may can potentially be a potential positive catalyst for bitcoin in terms of folks realizing that there are real long money, sorry, real structural players in the global financial markets that are taking an active interest and really betting on it to go higher.
00:16:34.032 - 00:17:11.651, Speaker B: And so I do think that 13 f filings can be a positive catalyst. And then the other part of it is just more platforms turning on. I do think that there are some constructive things that are happening, but right here, right now, it's really tough to call. It's really tough to call. And so I think technical levels are your friends. Bitcoin tends to respect them, at least on a first go and on retests and stuff. So right here, right now, probably best to keep positioning a little bit on the lighter side.
00:17:11.651 - 00:17:17.903, Speaker B: But for over the medium term, in the long run, I still think you're supposed to meant to stack.
00:17:18.603 - 00:17:23.747, Speaker A: Yeah. Bim netabeebeebi my friend from Galaxy trading. As always, thank you for coming on, galaxy brains.
00:17:23.875 - 00:17:24.983, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:17:26.843 - 00:17:32.963, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest merch from Chaincode Labs resident Mempool weatherman. Merch. Thank you for coming on, galaxy brains.
00:17:33.083 - 00:17:35.387, Speaker C: Hi, nice to. Thanks for having me.
00:17:35.435 - 00:17:41.824, Speaker A: Yeah, you're welcome. We don't know each other that well, but we hang out primarily at pub key, I think is where I usually see you.
00:17:41.904 - 00:17:43.344, Speaker C: Well, after bitdevs.
00:17:43.424 - 00:18:00.784, Speaker A: Exactly. And so you go to New York bitdevs all the time. Right. Are you a co organizer? Yeah, yeah, unfortunately, really, my bit devs experience had been in Boston, which was a. I'll call it a second tier bit devs, maybe even third.
00:18:00.864 - 00:18:02.000, Speaker C: I mean, they have some.
00:18:02.072 - 00:18:02.688, Speaker A: We tried.
00:18:02.816 - 00:18:07.056, Speaker C: Yeah, they have some very capable researchers there. Smaller crew, though. Yeah.
00:18:07.080 - 00:18:39.964, Speaker A: You have mit and fidelity and, like, coin meter, basically, I think is the main. In Castle island. That's the main orbit there. But, yeah, it was good. I wanted to have you on because you publish a mempool weather report all the time. Again, for our audience, I think most know. But the mempool is the queue of pending transactions on bitcoin and how busy it is or how much competition there is for block space often is what drives the transaction fees that people pay to, you know, get a transaction confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:18:39.964 - 00:18:55.780, Speaker A: So the mempool is an important thing to watch. And we've had an exciting mempool time, both the whole year for a year plus, but also for the having, I don't know, just what are your impressions on the mempool? Is the mempool really exciting today? Has it gotten more exciting?
00:18:55.932 - 00:19:39.918, Speaker C: I mean, the fee rates we saw around having were absolutely insane. I actually don't have the exact numbers, but it was over 2000 sats per v byte. If you calculate the average on the halving block, I think it would have been 3900 sats per v by average. So far, the highest fee rates we had seen were around Christmas 2017, with, I think barely 1200. And that was basically in the first phase of Segwit adoption. People were just starting to batch payments, or batching had been a thing people did, but it wasn't widely adopted yet. And then there was this contention around blocks are too small.
00:19:39.918 - 00:20:10.842, Speaker C: There may or may not have been some people that created extra transactions to stuff blocks. So since then, fee rates have never been that high. And we saw some in the last year to tune of 300 to 600 sats per v by at the peak of the hype for inscriptions and BRC 20 tokens. But for the most part. Yeah. We hadn't certainly not fee rates beyond 3000 sats per vbad.
00:20:10.978 - 00:20:16.978, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw. Like, I mean, I think there was one transaction identified that paid like half a million dollars to be in that block.
00:20:17.026 - 00:20:20.202, Speaker C: Yeah. Over eight bitcoins, I think. Crazy insane.
00:20:20.298 - 00:20:21.778, Speaker A: It was pretty fun to watch.
00:20:21.866 - 00:20:27.986, Speaker C: And honestly. Well, that rune they minted wasn't even that pretty, in my opinion.
00:20:28.010 - 00:20:48.138, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't. That was the. What, that zz fahu one? Yeah. Which I have to admit, I haven't gotten deep into runes really, specifically, but let's. We'll talk about that in a minute, too, because, yes. That activity specifically was this rush to, like, mint the first runes, which are these new fungible token color coin type protocol on bitcoin.
00:20:48.226 - 00:20:48.562, Speaker C: Correct.
00:20:48.618 - 00:20:53.218, Speaker A: Also from Casey Rodemore, the inventor of ordinals inscriptions.
00:20:53.306 - 00:21:50.414, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. My understanding is that Casey was not too excited about the BRC 20 protocol and basically sat down a couple months or maybe even longer to make maybe not the ultimate, but a much better fungible token protocol on bitcoin. And I generally am more of a bitcoin decurrency, sort of. Only my only interest is bitcoin decurrency. All this other stuff on top of bitcoin doesn't really excite me much, but I must appreciate that it uses opereturn outputs which are not part of the Utxo set. They are outputs that can't be spent, so they are not stored in the unspent transaction outputs. And it fits into the rules that we have for these null data outputs.
00:21:50.414 - 00:22:43.546, Speaker C: It is also using the Utxo model instead of writing ASCII into transactions in order to give instructions to the colored coin protocol on top. Like BRC 20 tokens, it just has a very compact encoding, and the actual token is transported in a Utxo. So I anticipate that this will cause a lot less bloat. And I was actually surprised how quickly the block space demand peak subsided. So fee rates went bonkers on Friday night with the halving. They were beyond 1000 sats per v byte for a day or so. And now last night it already had cleared down below 32 sats per vb.
00:22:43.546 - 00:22:44.454, Speaker C: And.
00:22:46.134 - 00:22:50.718, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'm seeing 45 right now. Ish. Yeah, I mean, it's elevated, but not.
00:22:50.766 - 00:23:20.518, Speaker C: It's slightly higher than before the halving. Right before the halving, people were trying to get some stuff into blocks, maybe even staging their rune etchings. And because it requires a commitment, is my understanding, and then it's not that much higher than, like, a week or two ago. Sure. A few weeks ago, it actually cleared down to five sets per v byte. So it's still higher and it's still money as. Especially at the exchange rate that we see now.
00:23:20.518 - 00:23:25.614, Speaker C: But I'd say it wasn't as bad as I anticipated.
00:23:25.734 - 00:23:37.174, Speaker A: Yeah, it was wild, though. On that day, I think it was the somebody. It was like, nine out of ten most expensive blocks in history were mined, like, right around then.
00:23:37.254 - 00:23:50.136, Speaker C: Yeah. And one of them, like, counted in bitcoin. Yeah, one of them was just a mistake. Where someone had attached, not created a change. I put and just sent something like 50 bitcoin.
00:23:50.240 - 00:23:51.884, Speaker A: Oh, man. Dicey.
00:23:52.304 - 00:24:24.696, Speaker C: But, yeah, we had a sequence of, I think, 104 blocks. Where there was more fees than subsidy. So the block reward, of course, is composed of two parts, the transaction fees and the subsidy. The subsidy are the new coins. The new coins have every 210,000 blocks. But for the longest time, or I should say, in the long run, we anticipate that we will transition to a block reward. That is mostly composed of transaction fees.
00:24:24.696 - 00:24:34.016, Speaker C: But we have hardly ever had blocks where the fees were higher than the subsidy. So we saw that a little bit around 2017.
00:24:34.160 - 00:24:39.072, Speaker A: But it was the all time high. There wasn't Segwit, as you pointed out. But, yes, other than that period, we.
00:24:39.088 - 00:24:40.488, Speaker C: Had less than ten blocks.
00:24:40.536 - 00:24:51.474, Speaker A: I don't even think any of the. You were talking about the BRC 20 spikes and peaks. Like, last May, there was a big fee spike. I don't think it got to the block reward, though.
00:24:51.774 - 00:25:08.956, Speaker C: It did for a few blocks. I think four or five blocks we had. So the block reward before the halving was 6.25 bitcoin. And we had a few blocks that were in the 600 sats per v byte. So 100 sats per v byte is one bitcoin. And fees for a full block.
00:25:08.956 - 00:25:26.920, Speaker C: So 600 sats per v. By. There were a few blocks, I think, that actually exceeded the 625. I think it was a handful or so. And now, after the halving, we've had a sequence of 104 blocks straight. That each had more fees than block subsidies.
00:25:26.952 - 00:25:43.436, Speaker A: And even now, when we look, obviously, the subsidy is halved. So it's easier for the percentage of minor revenue derived from fees to be higher. In fact, it should. If all else equal, it should double that stat on the halving. But it's higher. I think it's been decaying. It's been.
00:25:43.436 - 00:26:10.534, Speaker A: Now about. We're recording this on April 25. So it's been about almost a week. But even four or five days after that, percentage of revenue was still in the 30% to 50% range. So do you think this is, you said rightly and clearly, when the subsidy decays all the way down, the only thing left will be fees. But do you envision a more competitive, higher fee paying environment going forward? Is it inevitable?
00:26:10.654 - 00:26:58.574, Speaker C: Yeah, pretty much. In my opinion, blockspace is one of the limited resources, and it should and has to be one of the limited resources. It directly limits or restricts the amount of people that will be able to run a node at home. We want lots of people to be able to validate the blockchain fully themselves. It shouldn't take forever to catch up to the chain tip. I think once we have taken care of all the low hanging fruits for scaling, eventually we will increase the block size. But there's still lots of room how we can improve right now with the current block size limit, block weight limit, I should say.
00:26:58.574 - 00:28:07.474, Speaker C: I think that having this back pressure of the block weight limit forces people to innovate and to be efficient with the block space. It drives the adoption of best practices. If we had been kicking down the can the road, we would have probably increased the block size a few times already. We would have tons of metaprotocols writing more and more data to the blockchain all day long. And we'd get into ranges where it would be hard to run a full node on a home computer because it would be exceeding SSD drive sizes. I don't think it would be impossible at this point to run it at home, but it would certainly make it infeasible for people in less rich regions of the planet. And actually that is important that it is possible to run it all around the globe, because if we only have nodes in one country, eventually that might not be sufficient to keep the network unimpeachable.
00:28:08.134 - 00:28:42.516, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, for a distributed network, it's supposed to be resilient. That's like one of the main ARPANEt was made to avoid a nuclear apocalypse or survive one, right? It does need to be distributed and decentralized, I think is right. Also, we do have some data points. BSV, like, like aggressively increase the block size dramatically, and no one can run the nodes there. Right? It was like one of the few, was it blockchain, one of these few data companies that was like running a BSV node so we could see like transaction data like they should. And I don't remember if it was specifically blockchain that did this, but one of those types.
00:28:42.580 - 00:28:43.020, Speaker C: It was.
00:28:43.092 - 00:28:48.396, Speaker A: Yeah, they had to shut down their node. They're literally like, we can't afford to operate this anymore, let alone even when.
00:28:48.420 - 00:29:18.362, Speaker C: I was still at Bitgo, we, they did a test on mainnet with a 200 something gigabyte block, and it just. It's hard. Like, all of the bitcoin infrastructure is built around the notion that blocks are small and propagate quickly, and then suddenly there's blocks that come around that are 200,000 times bigger. That just causes issues probably on the.
00:29:18.378 - 00:29:21.546, Speaker A: Peer to peer network, but also parsers the nodes themselves.
00:29:21.690 - 00:29:28.188, Speaker C: Back then, even the BSV network was down to a dozen nodes or so. Right. Well, I assume that it's not down.
00:29:28.236 - 00:29:53.424, Speaker A: To one node, single digit Calvin Ayres yacht. There's one node there. No. And then also, if you look at other blockchains like Solana, which has a very high throughput demands and lots of data, those nodes are ludicrously expensive to operate. And in their defense, that's actually their entire scaling strategy. So all power to them. But again, very, very different and extremely expensive.
00:29:53.424 - 00:30:05.024, Speaker A: No individuals are running a Solana node in their home, basically, like, you need to be a professional with professional rack space to basically operate that network, which is anathema to the goals of bitcoin. So I hear you right.
00:30:05.064 - 00:30:18.312, Speaker C: I mean, if, I appreciate that they're very upfront about their scaling idea and that is what they're trying to do. But from what I understand, it's also been plagued with downtimes and.
00:30:18.408 - 00:30:49.164, Speaker A: Yeah, and actually, interestingly, I think a big part of that is, I think they've changed this a little bit. They have what they call local fee markets. Now, certain apps need priority fees in order to. Or there's a market for interacting with certain programs on Solana, but historically, they had no transaction fees. And so what did they get? Like tons of spam all the time. And we're sort of thinking about this, like, wait a second, we know how to disincentivize spam. We charge fees.
00:30:49.164 - 00:30:50.644, Speaker A: We have a fee market.
00:30:51.894 - 00:31:37.388, Speaker C: I'm still very confident in the approach of bitcoin in that matter. I think that the value density of bitcoin transactions is a manifold multiple of most other transactions data, sorry, blockchains data. I think the average amount of money that's being transferred per bitcoin transaction is significantly higher. I think that the out of band and, like, the compression of what's happening in the background, the whole idea of having a contract that might be committed to but executed out of band all of that just makes so much more sense for a network in which basically everyone checks everyone else's homework.
00:31:37.476 - 00:32:00.140, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I think that has been the idea that's really been core to Bitcoin's overall, like, scaling philosophy is like, well, theoretically, you don't have to put the whole program on there. You instead commit to the output or something. Right. You don't store the whole document. You store a hash of the document. Right. That's changed a little bit now with inscriptions here.
00:32:00.140 - 00:32:20.240, Speaker A: But you also mentioned this about Casey and runes, and I think it is really worth noting that he did not invent VRC 20. Somebody did that on top of inscriptions. Inscriptions were not designed for that. They were designed by. In his own words, he came on this podcast and explained this, too, for classic nfts, basically, images, artwork, stuff like that. Documents. Yes.
00:32:20.240 - 00:32:44.630, Speaker A: You want to preserve a famous speech or a censored work. I can respect that. I'm kind of ambivalent. We won't go all the way into the inscription thing, but I think it's quite elegant what he's done with runes. It does follow the. It uses opera turn, which was designed specifically for this type of purpose. The byte size limit there was limited to allow, but limit its use for things like this.
00:32:44.630 - 00:33:01.074, Speaker A: Omni, the tether protocol, used to use operaturn for this purpose. And in that way, it's kind of. People give them a lot of crap because the main thing people are doing with these is creating worthless altcoins. Worthless, really? Even meme coins. Right. Not truly. No utility.
00:33:01.074 - 00:33:12.654, Speaker A: And they're like, oh, that level of shitcoining on bitcoin isn't something we want. It's like, okay, but he did do it in the. The bitcoin native way. That's not damaging to the.
00:33:12.694 - 00:33:38.454, Speaker C: Yeah, and so maybe a little context on op return, right before op returns were introduced. Counterparty, I think, popularized using a one of three multisig, bare multisig as a data carrier, where it was one of one, really, because only one of the pub keys was an actual pub key, and the other two pub keys were used as data carrier.
00:33:38.494 - 00:33:40.974, Speaker A: Yeah. So literally putting text in, like, the.
00:33:41.014 - 00:34:14.422, Speaker C: Address output right in the pub key of the multisig. So this had a bit of a resurgence with stamps recently, and that is really the worst because you're writing directly to the Utxo set. The Utxo set, of course, being sort of the state of the ledger, the current available spendable balances. And writing to that, that's unprunable. Everybody has to keep you have to keep that. That is really not something you want to see.
00:34:14.478 - 00:34:20.830, Speaker A: There are prior versions of the Utxo set, but you need to know the current state of the supply, of all the supply. That's basically what it is.
00:34:20.862 - 00:34:21.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:21.774 - 00:34:23.894, Speaker A: So loading. That is particularly rude.
00:34:23.974 - 00:34:41.930, Speaker C: Right, exactly. And up returns right to the blockchain. And the blockchain, of course, is pruneable. It is. If you want the full journal of all the movements that have ever happened. You have a full archive, sure. But if you're just looking at the current state of the network, you need only the Utxo set.
00:34:41.930 - 00:35:38.004, Speaker C: So writing to the blockchain is significantly more benign than writing to the Utxo set. So my understanding is that opereturns were actually introduced at that point because people were writing directly in output scripts into the Utxo set and developers were like, well, here's an output type. We'll make it standard, we'll limit it to one output per transaction. It's limited in size to, I believe it started at 40, then got eventually increased to 83 bytes. And this is big enough for a signature and a pub key and or I guess one or the other. And it's enough for a hash of something if you want to hash a document or a tree of documents. But it's sort of a compromise here.
00:35:38.004 - 00:37:03.242, Speaker C: We'll give you a way to do this, but please don't write to the Utxo. Said so in a way, the resurgence of the stamps was extra annoying recently, and the way BRC 20 and inscription stuff worked out, where a lot of people are segregating their nfts and tokens into separate Utxos and then never touch them again and write them to the Utxos, that's kind of aggravating. So I appreciate that. The runes protocol actually allows you to have many different runes on a single utic, so split them out and. And change it just with a single op return in a transaction. I think that's, while I care none for all of it, I think that's a good step towards a more sustainable state. If people want to purchase block space, and this is the most important thing they want to do with it, as long as blockspace is fully demanded and they pay for the privilege, I find less fault in that than back then when opereturn was introduced and blockspace was actually not fully demanded, and we would have basically given people a writing permission to use all the remaining block space for cheap.
00:37:03.242 - 00:37:43.432, Speaker C: So as long as block space is fully demanded and they have to compete with, with financial transactions for that block space. I think it'll be self limiting and the novelty of it will wear off if a few, a handful of colored coins survive and actually have a use. And people spend a ton of money to write actual big digital art into the blockchain. That is not going to hurt the financial transaction use case that much. This doesn't keep me awake at night, right?
00:37:43.528 - 00:37:57.656, Speaker A: Yeah, me neither. I think that if it did, then it would keep me awake at night. But maybe it will. But we're not there. I liked your point earlier too, about the limited block size. I was joking about the taproot wizards. They put that four megabyte image.
00:37:57.656 - 00:38:25.442, Speaker A: They filled the whole block basically with one transaction that they mined like, or sent out a ban to get mined. And I was like, if we had ten megabyte blocks, I guarantee you they'd have made a ten megabyte image. And similarly we would get more. Right? It's like that fallacy of induced demand, right paradox. If we open the highways, the cars will fill them. So it's better to keep it limited and force people to figure out ways to fit more cars without.
00:38:25.618 - 00:38:54.826, Speaker C: Exactly. In 2017, the block space got very high demand and fee rates went into hundreds of sats per Vbyte. People started switching over to wrapped Segwit. People started batching payments. I was at Betgo at that time working on the backend, and I remember sending an email to a client. They were a big exchange, doing hundreds of transactions per day. And we calculated for them.
00:38:54.826 - 00:39:14.506, Speaker C: Hey, if you change your getaddress call here in this one parameter, you'll get a wrapped segwit parameter. Instead, you just have to use the recent software we published and you'll start saving fifty k a month. And the CTO wrote back and said, we'll do it Monday.
00:39:14.650 - 00:39:39.438, Speaker A: Exactly. There was a thing too, with the batching. There was some, I remember at the time, there was some speculation that one of the reasons that Coinbase was on the big blocker side at some points was that they are pretty unique, as you probably know well, in the way that they custody coins. Almost everyone uses some version of like a hot, cold wallet setup where like, you have sort of one very.
00:39:39.486 - 00:39:41.710, Speaker C: Yeah, an omni wallet where everything is mingled.
00:39:41.782 - 00:40:15.204, Speaker A: And then eventually you sweep into cold storage and if you need to replenish, then you go back and forth, but they kind of blow all theirs out until these random. A bunch of different utxos or a bunch of different addresses in this weird way. And someone had done an analysis, I recall that was like, they actually have a fair amount that causes a lot of dust for them. And they had a fair amount of effectively unspendable coins. And so maybe that was why they wanted the block size increased. It took them until I think, when did I write 2022, I think maybe the spring of 22, that they were observed finally batching transactions.
00:40:15.704 - 00:40:33.776, Speaker C: From my understanding, it was even worse. They believed in the from address as a concept. And when you would send funds from your coinbase wallet, they would first send funds to the address of the user and then send from the user's address.
00:40:33.840 - 00:40:37.120, Speaker A: Out so that they could give every user like a unique from.
00:40:37.232 - 00:40:44.848, Speaker C: Yeah. And it would cause them to create an extra transaction for every single payment and then keep split utixos for.
00:40:44.896 - 00:40:49.176, Speaker A: So not just not batching all the withdrawals, but actually doubling the transactions.
00:40:49.280 - 00:41:04.192, Speaker C: And imagine that with the biggest blockchain company in the US basically probably, I don't know, probably responsible for a sizable portion of all bitcoin transactions and then doubling the amount of two of them.
00:41:04.288 - 00:41:09.884, Speaker A: Now for every one, when really it should be like one for every ten. They should be collapsing them, not doubling them.
00:41:10.304 - 00:41:25.176, Speaker C: I mean, at least recently they started being able to send to pay to taproot from their custody wallet, but they still can't send to pay to taproot from their, their end user wallet, which just. It's been over two years.
00:41:25.200 - 00:41:40.496, Speaker A: Come on, let's talk. Let's shift gears here a little bit. We could chitchat to more. I think it's in it. We're going to follow up with you more too. Maybe we're going to start featuring your weather report as well. Murch is a great follow, by the way, on X.com,
00:41:40.496 - 00:42:09.598, Speaker A: great website on his coverage of mempool and fee dynamics. So I encourage people to check him out. We'll put his link to his X account, the show notes. Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about bitcoin governance a little bit. I guess this week you and four others were added as maintainers of the Bip repo, which is the bitcoin improvement proposals repo on GitHub. Luke Dash Junior has been the sole maintainer of that repo for a long time.
00:42:09.598 - 00:42:36.990, Speaker A: He's a very busy person. There's also a lot of work. A lot of people are submitting bips and wanting to do stuff with bitcoin upgrade discussions and review. And I followed some. It was actually one of my favorite bitcoin mailing lists, I guess now bitcoin Google group. But discussions in a long time was this thread about what to do with this. Could we add people who should be added anyway? What is that? So you're now a maintainer of this repo.
00:42:36.990 - 00:42:52.178, Speaker A: It's not the bitcoin core repository, which is the code base for bitcoin core. It's the. It's basically a text database. These are proposals, they're not code. Sometimes there's code, but what is it? And what is this new role that you've agreed to help with?
00:42:52.266 - 00:43:41.564, Speaker C: Yeah, okay. So we refer to it as bipeditors. So the idea here is we have a distributor of group contributing to bitcoin software. A lot of them, of course, work on bitcoin core, but by far not all of them. And the protocol is sort of the shared language between all the implementations that implement the bitcoin protocol. And so there needs to be a space to design changes or improvements to the bitcoin protocol. And it is really hard if conversations are happening in so many different venues, like mailing lists, forums on x, on meetups, when people get together, whatever.
00:43:41.564 - 00:44:37.292, Speaker C: And one way to at least be sure that you're talking about the same ideas is to have a central place where you can host a reference, or rather a specific, comprehensive and detailed write up of ideas, so that you actually know that you're discussing the same thing in the same details. So the bip repository is supposed to be this place where you can present an idea to your peers as a reference that everybody can talk about. Right. So the main purpose is to make available a well written document, high quality document, and put it to discussion. Now, the repository has existed for, I don't know, since the beginning of.
00:44:37.308 - 00:44:45.068, Speaker A: It's a long. I don't. If I go back to like BiP one or two, I think it says like on GitHub, like twelve years ago or something like that. So it's old.
00:44:45.156 - 00:44:46.588, Speaker C: Yeah. Amir Tucky wrote bite.
00:44:46.596 - 00:45:10.446, Speaker A: And there's some important. Iconic, by the way. Not all of them are actually protocol upgrades. Right? Like BiP 32 is what? Seed phrases and stuff. There's some, it's hierarchical, but they're all, thank you, HD wallets, they call them. Yes, but they're all sort of universal and they're all important, I would say for the most part, there's a bunch.
00:45:10.470 - 00:46:01.956, Speaker C: Of them that have not been adopted, a few that are rejected. There's a couple that are essentially reports of events that happened. Overflow bug in 2012 2013 is written up as a pip, for example. Yeah. So there's three different tracks. There's the standards track, the informational track, and the procedure track procedure is Bip one, bip two, which basically lays out how the repository works, the role of the bip editors, what sort of information is being collected by which standards they're being evaluated for, the submissions are being evaluated. And informational would be, for example, the fork, the accidental fork, around 0.85,
00:46:01.956 - 00:46:16.548, Speaker C: which was with the LevelDB database, I think. And there was, or the buffer, sorry, the integer overflow where billions of bitcoin were created.
00:46:16.636 - 00:46:33.508, Speaker A: That would be an interesting, there was a catastrophic bug, briefly, yes. It resulted in kind of, maybe one of the main things that shouldn't happen in a bug for bitcoin is the supply cap to be broken. But that was quickly rectified. But so there's some, you're saying on the informational side, there's some like after.
00:46:33.556 - 00:47:06.656, Speaker C: Action reports of other informational documents are wallet best practices. How do you derive seed phrases? How do you, which paths do you use to find an account, your change versus receive addresses and so forth? I guess today maybe some of those could be labeled standards track because we want different wallets to be able to import backups of other wallets. But for the most part it was just like, hey, here's a good idea how to solve this so people don't lose funds.
00:47:06.720 - 00:47:16.232, Speaker A: Share it and make it widely available. You can just share that link now. You don't have to be like, hey, did you see that thing that merch said about how to do your wallet really well, dude, just reference the specific.
00:47:16.328 - 00:48:21.150, Speaker C: There it is. And that's really, they need to be technically sound, they need to be detailed enough that you can actually implement it from that description. And that's the purpose of a bip, an idea broken down to the level where you can implement it probably with a reference implementation. If it's about code and something that people can use to measure their own implementation of something, there's test vectors often included. So in a way, the role as a bip editor is very much janitorial. You make sure that the criteria are fulfilled. Has this bib been submitted to the mailing list? Has it been discussed? What was the feedback? Is it complete? Is it finished? Is it beyond the ideation phase? And then eventually just assign a number so that people know how to reference the document and be able to speak about it.
00:48:21.342 - 00:48:31.514, Speaker A: So does it increase the likelihood of an upgrade getting into the protocol eventually, if it has, if it's in the BIP repo?
00:48:34.134 - 00:49:22.378, Speaker C: I guess probably because even though it is not meant as such, I guess having a BIP number is by many interpreted as sort of an endorsement. I guess it is sort of an endorsement, at least in the sense that it indicates the idea has been described in sufficient detail that it was accepted into the BIP repository. There's plenty of bips that have never been implemented. There is a bunch of Bips that are widely considered bad ideas in the hundreds range. For example, there's at least five different ways of how we could increase the block size, none of which ever happened. So just being in the Bibs repository is not sufficient to be a recommendation for implementation.
00:49:22.506 - 00:50:12.986, Speaker A: Does it make it easier? So Luke is a prolific developer on bitcoin. He's had many important contributions. I would say he has become a little bit of a controversial figure. I mean, he had, he was even, remember, his input was viewed as controversial during the taproot discussions a number of times that I watched on the mailing list. But even that aside, there's a lot of people that want to make proposals for upgrades and stuff, and he was just one person. Is there anything more to it that observers should look? Is it just that this is a fair amount of work, and really it should be done by a group of people? Or was there something more to it? Was there behind the impetus for people wanting others to be editors?
00:50:13.090 - 00:51:39.644, Speaker C: I mean, it's definitely a bunch of work, and especially if it's such a mountain of work, it's hard to know where to start. Some of these bips are several pages. They're meant to be concise, but sometimes just describing a detailed idea in sufficient precision requires quite a bit of work. And so BIP two, the process bib that defines how the BIP repository works, indicates, for example, that ideas or improvement proposals should only be merged to the repository if they're technically sound, if they stick with the philosophy of bitcoin. So in my opinion, and this is just something that might affect the future. Currently we follow the BIP two, of course, because that's the standard that this repository is guided by. But maybe if we eventually write a successor document to BIP two, I would like to clean up the language around that a little bit to clarify that technical soundness should mean it is sufficiently detailed and has all the information so you can implement it.
00:51:39.644 - 00:52:00.220, Speaker C: Because on the one hand, Biptoo says just because an idea might be considered bad or unlikely to be adopted is not sufficient criteria to not merge it. But on the other hand, there's these judgment calls that are being asked from BIP editors that are like, is this technically sound? Does it stick with the philosophy of bitcoin, right?
00:52:00.252 - 00:52:22.722, Speaker A: Right. So you don't really, as a bip editor, correct me if I'm wrong, you prefer not to be judging that blatantly or that subjectively. Whether it is the philosophy of bitcoin, that's a pretty big. Frankly, that's a pretty big loophole here. Like a lot of people could think something is or is like, there's a lot of thing, a range of things that might be part of the philosophy of it.
00:52:22.738 - 00:53:18.174, Speaker C: What is the philosophy of it? I mean, like, some people feel like it's a store of value. Some people want to use it for payments, some people use it to send money abroad. For some people, the most important thing is the censorship resistance. I mean, we all agree on the rules that we implement per choosing which node software we run, but our motivations couldn't be more different. What excites us about bitcoin and so forth? So I find it extremely hard to say, or to answer the question, what would it mean for something to stick with the philosophy of bitcoin? In my opinion, it should be replaced with something more concretely measurable. So, for example, on stack exchange, we restrict our topics to the technologies that support the bitcoin currency. And that is different from everything possible that you could do with the bitcoin network.
00:53:18.174 - 00:53:38.346, Speaker C: And, for example, very clearly excludes colored coins because they're not about bitcoin, the currency. Right. So if you had a more precise way of making clear what the editor is supposed to judge, it would be way easier to have a conversation about it. But does it stick with the philosophy.
00:53:38.370 - 00:54:20.244, Speaker A: Of bitcoin is completely subjective, so broad and subjective. Does that then, because it could mean a lot of. It does mean a lot of things to different people. Does having more people, a more diverse group of people, a bigger group, be bit better? Just does that then do you think, is it likely to expand the types of bips that can get through that door? Because, say, you or John attack or Lalu or whomever might have different, each of you could merge one, theoretically, or could bring one in. Do you see what I'm saying? Does it expand the potential for this database? Is the database going to get huge now, you think? More people editing? Maybe not. I'm just.
00:54:20.364 - 00:55:20.052, Speaker C: All of us basically are supposed to have the same level of privilege right now, of course, we're being onboarded and taught the ropes. I interpret this to mean that one of the bip editors has to be convinced that it sticks with the philosophy of bitcoin. So far, we've been keeping away from any that are controversial among us. But this is, for example, affecting some work of people that's been in progress for years and is held up, at least in the BIP process at that point. And some of us are more sympathetic to merging stuff. Some feel like some of these documents should not be bips. So it's an ongoing conversation, and I think maybe one that would be better addressed by a public discussion on the mailing list.
00:55:20.052 - 00:56:43.714, Speaker C: There's a very interesting thread where especially Tim Ruffing has been contributing some ideas by how the process could be clarified. And maybe, maybe eventually we can take some of those suggestions and other contributions to that discussion as starting point for a successor document. We've made some minor improvements to BIP two already this week. For example, one thing that was holding up a lot of pull requests to the repository was there had been an open proposal to change the process to allow, I should take a step back and clarify the BIP documents, even though they are in a repository owned by the, well, public. Basically the document itself is owned by the author and it is considered the personal opinion of that offer a personal recommendation. So changing that document to say something else would be putting words into the mouth of the original author. So the general guideline had been up to this point that documents can only be amended per the request of the author.
00:56:43.714 - 00:57:27.166, Speaker C: Or if someone else makes the suggestion, the author at least has to sign off on everything. And now bitcoin's been around for 15 years and a bunch of people have moved on to other things. They don't look at the BIP repository anymore or have actively disavowed from Work on bitcoin. So you would never get sign off from these people to make a typo fix on their documents. So we had some 50 or so pull requests to the repository where someone spelled A Word correctly. And if you strictly read BIP two, as it was until last week, you wouldn't be able to merge this change to the document, even though you only fix a typo.
00:57:27.270 - 00:57:27.630, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:27.702 - 00:57:31.902, Speaker C: Because it's a change to the document and the Author hasn't signed off.
00:57:31.958 - 00:57:32.246, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:32.310 - 00:57:42.494, Speaker C: So we, we have loosened this a little in the sense that we now allow merging document, sorry, changes to the documents that do not change the meaning.
00:57:42.534 - 00:57:45.542, Speaker A: Non substantive changes. Yeah, formatting.
00:57:45.638 - 00:57:54.552, Speaker C: Spelling, spelling, grammar errors. Yeah, formatting depends. It could sort of, I mean, like.
00:57:54.568 - 00:58:54.114, Speaker A: If there's like a missing line break, not like changing the format, but like, yeah, that's interesting. I mean it's, I just, I think especially people who follow, like other blockchain development stuff, like in other blockchain ecosystems. Take ethereum, for example, which I would venture to say is among the most decentralized development processes, but really notably more centralized than bitcoin, in my opinion, but still also quite decentralized in the scheme of things. And of course, they use the EIP process, which is really just, they took the BIP process and mostly adopted that and slightly changed a couple of things. But I think if you watch some of those other ecosystems, you'll be stunned at how careful, slow, deliberate this whole thing is. Because this entire conversation about the BIP repo, we're talking about submitting documents to use as proposals for changes, we're not taught, we haven't even yet talked about how to. Then how does the debate happen in the governance of actually considering a proposal?
00:58:54.274 - 00:59:06.954, Speaker C: Right. And that's also one of the main sources of frustration that people had with the BIPS repository was we can't even talk about the ideas properly until they're sort of fixed in public.
00:59:07.034 - 00:59:09.472, Speaker A: Like we need a library just to reference them first.
00:59:09.618 - 00:59:57.362, Speaker C: So this week, for example, we merged one bip that had been open for 559 days. And really it basically hasn't had any feedback or changes since. Most of that period of time, it just hadn't gotten merged. I think one thing that I hope comes out of having more people on this process is that we, of course, have different interests and might look at different parts of the open, pull requests. And when we discover that something is actually ready, we can merge it and move it forward, and people can start using the BIP number to reference and discuss the things. So three bips have been merged. Sorry, one BIP has been merged.
00:59:57.362 - 00:59:59.114, Speaker C: Three numbers have been assigned.
00:59:59.274 - 01:00:01.330, Speaker A: I saw one was assigned for OpcaT. Is that right?
01:00:01.362 - 01:00:08.046, Speaker C: Opcat, op TX hash. And there was one more. It eludes me right now.
01:00:08.110 - 01:00:42.674, Speaker A: Yeah. But it does seem like if we can clean up, if you guys can move it faster, clean up the process of creating this reference material or getting it nice and centralized and sort of moving, then we can. Then maybe downstream, it can result in more efficient and productive actual debates around upgrades. I know there's a lot of the people want. Well, there's a lot of different competing upgrades that a lot of different people want. I think the only one I've ever publicly said that I'm very supportive of is CTV, Jeremy Rubin's upgrade, which. But again, I don't.
01:00:42.674 - 01:00:50.382, Speaker A: I'm still kind of ambivalent in the scheme of things, but I'm officially supportive of that, I guess you could say, but I do.
01:00:50.398 - 01:00:52.554, Speaker C: That's a strange dichotomy.
01:00:53.334 - 01:01:07.990, Speaker A: I just mean I've come out specifically and endorsed this one. But I mean, I like a lot of the covenants involved. Proposals I think are quite interesting. But anyway, there's, and then cat is a whole separate convert. Can do a lot with opcat. That's a strange one. By the way, I want to ask you about this.
01:01:07.990 - 01:01:14.894, Speaker A: Not really bip repo related, but just bitcoin upgrade related. Opcat existed already. Satoshi took it out.
01:01:14.934 - 01:01:15.158, Speaker C: Right?
01:01:15.206 - 01:01:34.054, Speaker A: So like, have we ever had to, you know, I can't think of one. A proposed upgrade that's actually genuinely like. It would actually add a lot of features, capabilities, but technically we already had it. The code is already well known. It was in early clients, it was in the early protocol.
01:01:34.394 - 01:01:47.770, Speaker C: I haven't actually reviewed that heavily. My understanding is that OpCAT enables a lot of hashing and making very big stacks.
01:01:47.922 - 01:01:48.666, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:48.850 - 01:02:13.622, Speaker C: So in the language processing of the bitcoin script, language stuff is put on a stack and evaluated, and you could get a stack blow up using OpcaT. I assume that any process to activate that would very carefully need to analyze what sort of potential DOS attacks, or.
01:02:13.798 - 01:02:16.966, Speaker A: You don't want infinite looping. Basically, it could break.
01:02:17.150 - 01:02:41.476, Speaker C: Yeah. The halting problem is one thing, but just also if transaction validation takes forever, that would be quite problematic on the network if you could send transactions that take extremely long to validate. Bitcoin core, for example, right now is a single threaded operation. So when you receive a transaction and validate it, you'll not do anything else, you will not process blocks, you will.
01:02:41.500 - 01:02:47.356, Speaker A: Not forward every single thing in linear order. Right. Parallel execution can't do multiple things at once.
01:02:47.420 - 01:03:26.758, Speaker C: I mean, there's work towards pulling out certain parts, like that wallet, for example, would be decoupled from the node software itself, but that's still ongoing. Originally, when bitcoin Core was published, sorry, I should say the bitcoin software was published because bitcoin core was only introduced as a name much later. It was essentially a single file main CPP, and it's now of course way bigger, so forth. But this single threadedness is still something that is probably not how you would design it if you rewrote it from scratch.
01:03:26.806 - 01:03:48.312, Speaker A: There's actually a number of those things. I know people revere Satoshi, obviously an innovator that created this incredible system that does work, and it did work early. But yes, I think even it's fair to say there's things that Satoshi could have learned. That's what I don't like. Right. And probably would have even themselves done it differently or done some things differently. I mean, wasn't there a poker klein in his first release?
01:03:48.408 - 01:04:02.624, Speaker C: Yes, but also, it's super unfair. Right? We're evaluating someone 15 years later on a completely novel concept that they came up with. With the knowledge of 15 years.
01:04:02.664 - 01:04:37.394, Speaker A: Yeah. And also with, like, you know, hundreds, dozens, hundreds, thousands of people contributing. Now, I mean, I'm of the belief, not that it matters, but that Satoshi was one person. And so, like, judging one person's code, which, by the way, was a huge leap forward with not only the 15 years of hindsight, but the thousands of eyeballs that have commented and offered thoughts, would be unfair. Right. Before we end here, merch, I would love to have you tell people a little bit about what chain code does and what you do at chain code and what you're working on. If that's what is chain code labs, it's in New York.
01:04:37.854 - 01:05:15.134, Speaker C: Yeah. We're basically an organization that pays people to work on research and development around bitcoin. I can't really talk for chain code, but my work there is mostly open source stuff. I do a lot of outreach. I co host bitcoin optic recap every week. I co host the New York bit devs, the New York bitcoin developer meetup. And, yeah, I contribute to bitcoin core and just try to help the bitcoin project move forward.
01:05:15.214 - 01:05:44.442, Speaker A: Very cool. And shout out you also, I think you mentioned this earlier in the interview, but you worked at Bitgo, and there's a shout out to bitgo because I know a lot of talented bitcoin developers that have come out of bitgo, including you. And I mentioned my friend Mason Borda or Jameson Lopp is a well known one and several, many others. So they're doing something right over there when it comes to. Also, they were the first to. They had taproot addresses on day one. I believe they launched with them.
01:05:44.442 - 01:06:02.862, Speaker A: And I think similarly, even though at the time, Mike Belshi was a vocal proponent of larger blocks, he later, by the way, sort of many did not do this, but he, to his credit, did sort of basically said, well, okay, like, you know, the market went a different way, and, like, I'm fine with that. Done with it. And they implemented segwit, like, almost right away. Were you there when you guys. Was that you there we go.
01:06:02.958 - 01:06:09.030, Speaker C: Well, that's why they had good people. Segwit implementation back then. We were two weeks after segwit activation. We had it on bitgo.
01:06:09.102 - 01:06:09.574, Speaker A: There you go.
01:06:09.614 - 01:07:07.124, Speaker C: And then we invited some of our clients to switch over to using it because it would save them a lot of money. Yeah. So I started at Bitgo in 2017, in April, I think. And so I worked on the Segwit implementation and a bunch of other backend stuff, did some coin selection improvements, and, yeah, it was very fun, especially right in the beginning when we were just focused on bitcoin and I was one of the first 30 or so employees, and we were just a tiny company, and almost everybody knew what was going on with everything. It got way bigger later, for sure, and we had way more responsibilities. We were doing all these dozens of other protocols and so forth.
01:07:08.104 - 01:07:18.502, Speaker A: It's evolved. Well, merch from Chaincode Labs, my friend. Hey, congratulations on the new bitcoin improvement proposal. Repo editor, bip editor role.
01:07:18.608 - 01:07:19.010, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:07:19.042 - 01:07:38.330, Speaker A: It's going to be very interesting and I'm looking forward to it. Merch is one of the better, in my opinion, one of my favorite commentators on bitcoin and bitcoin development. So really excited to see you and thank you very much. You're welcome. And to see you help explain to us what is happening in the world of bips. And also, maybe we'll get more. I mean, you know, I just, I'd rather scroll there and see more new ideas.
01:07:38.330 - 01:07:41.594, Speaker A: Seems like you guys are going to be able to get them out there to the public.
01:07:41.754 - 01:07:56.826, Speaker C: Yeah, really. I mean, it is a place to publish ideas, so maybe we should first let them be published and then people form their opinions, and then we can still not do the bad ones, but maybe a few more of the good ones actually make it out into the public perception.
01:07:56.890 - 01:08:00.962, Speaker A: That would be great. Merch, my friend from Chain Code Labs, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
01:08:01.018 - 01:08:02.346, Speaker C: Thank you for having me.
