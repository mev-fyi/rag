00:00:07.920 - 00:00:12.494, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to galaxy brains.
00:00:12.614 - 00:00:13.654, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.774 - 00:00:15.594, Speaker A: Big day today. Fed day.
00:00:16.094 - 00:00:16.766, Speaker B: Huge day.
00:00:16.830 - 00:00:17.102, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:17.158 - 00:00:18.046, Speaker B: Basically the Super bowl.
00:00:18.070 - 00:00:19.526, Speaker A: And it was a big day, right, because.
00:00:19.590 - 00:00:20.430, Speaker B: Unbelievable day.
00:00:20.462 - 00:00:21.310, Speaker A: Tell us what happened.
00:00:21.382 - 00:00:58.968, Speaker B: So we started the day with ADP, which came in softer than expected, around 100,000 jobs. Employment data that was soft. The employment cost index came in at 0.9 versus expectations of 1%. So a notable measure for wages that Powell specifically tracks and loves came in soft. In addition, you had a regional bank that was experiencing a pretty significant drawdown in its share price as a function of loan loss provisions. And so we're seeing some weakness in finance, although it does seem a little bit idiosyncratic.
00:00:58.968 - 00:02:14.284, Speaker B: You had the refunding announcement also in the morning, but that didn't really move markets, but that gave a really aggressive bid to fixed income in advance of the Fed. And we saw two year treasuries and all the short dated FOMC pricing move super aggressively, almost as if Powell had happened at 830. And then we got to Powell, and the statement read more hawkish than I think most market participants expected. And really, during the pressure, the key takeaway and the key statement was March is not likely for cuts, for cuts, but the pricing is still at, call it 35%, call it eight, nine bps, or somewhere around there, could cut, could cut. And the logic, essentially, that he gave out in terms of the Fed's response function that would get them to cut was continued progress on inflation. And so basically, they've had six months in a row of really good inflation data. And that's why the six month run rate for core PCE is below 2%, which is their target, and three months, actually one, six.
00:02:14.284 - 00:02:56.184, Speaker B: But specifically, they probably need to see a couple more months of that. And if you got something even lower than that, then you could potentially be talking about earlier or bigger cuts. But it basically set the stage for the Fed to begin cutting around the spring of this year. I would say most analysts expect May, June, September cuts to the tune of, for the calendar year 2024. Anywhere from 100 to 150 basis points is where the range of expectations are, and that is going to hold. I would say equities did not like the pressure. They traded down.
00:02:56.184 - 00:03:38.344, Speaker B: S and P was off a percent and a half, and Nasdaq was off close to 2%. Some of that was based on earnings that we had. But a lot of it is just feds not cutting in March. And then lastly, there was, I'd say, minimal talk of the balance sheet and normalizing the runoff, but that's going to come into focus around the same time when cuts start. Get going. I'm in the camp that they need to be cutting already. I think the way we're looking at data now is entirely not representative of the data set in the sense that, like, I'll give you one example.
00:03:38.344 - 00:04:23.614, Speaker B: There's the establishment survey for non farm payrolls, and then there's the household survey, the disparity between the two, it just keeps on growing and it shows a totally different picture. And if you look at more qualitative things, like how many people have two jobs, right, what are the kind of work that people are doing? Is it white collar work that is increasing or is it more blue collar? And when you start to look at the core qualitative measures of things, the employment picture doesn't look great. And then more and more people, like every podcast that I listen to nowadays, obviously ours is the best. But more and more people just highlight the fact that these surveys are just not that reliable. The response rates on these economic surveys are abysmal.
00:04:23.694 - 00:04:24.142, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:24.238 - 00:04:41.046, Speaker B: Right? And another thing, I mean, there was an analyst on tv talking about it today, but when you look at like state level employment data, like state by state level employment data and then compare it to the national average, you're like, wait, two plus two is equaling five right now.
00:04:41.110 - 00:04:41.670, Speaker A: I see.
00:04:41.782 - 00:05:23.436, Speaker B: And so there's just such weird distortions that I think you need to rely on other things and you need to look at things more realistically. And realistically, we have core pc that's around 2%, likely going to be around 2%. And you've got a Fed funds rate that's at 530. That means you have 300 plus basis points of restriction in the economy. And I think the main thing that I know for sure is that the business cycle has not gone away and that it kind of seems like things are shifting in the sense that companies are more comfortable laying off people. Like you're seeing more and more layoff headlines, et cetera. I think you're starting to see a normalization of supply chains post COVID.
00:05:23.436 - 00:05:53.900, Speaker B: And so I think the world is becoming much more normal, and therefore, monetary policy needs to be much more normal. And we're about 300 basis points away from normal right now. And I think reinflation risk is a little over hyped. And I think some people lean on commodities and stuff. But you look at China, they're having financial, a GFC type of event in their markets right now. And oil, even with all this stuff in the Red Sea, is barely reacting.
00:05:53.972 - 00:05:54.540, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:54.692 - 00:06:16.556, Speaker B: And so I think you're at a point where the commod complex is healthy, I think, in terms of not that much upside risks, and the global economy is slowing. That's why other central banks are cutting. You had surprises in UK CPI. You've had ecbs expected to cut in April. It's all going that way. And the Fed, I think, is a little behind the curve at this point.
00:06:16.620 - 00:06:24.776, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. They just want to hang on. They don't want to do it just yet. You had said maybe a few episodes ago, if you're going to do it in March, which now they, now he's saying they want.
00:06:24.800 - 00:06:27.024, Speaker B: If you're going to do it in May, might as well start in March.
00:06:27.144 - 00:07:01.852, Speaker A: And you kind of like, theoretically they could have already done it like, I mean, it's sort of, it's just in laying the inevitable for. And you were also making the point about the politics point, which is if you're going to be cutting, you want to have been cutting by the time, if you're the Fed, by the time the presidential election comes, you don't want to like, wait, wait, wait. And then just like cut rates right before the election and somehow, again. Cause that destabilizes the economy and then be perceived as to being unfair and whatnot. I just want to throw out one more thing. So now we're thinking, what, between March and may, maybe they cut on March or May. And that's the current thinking in the market.
00:07:01.852 - 00:07:43.644, Speaker A: May, May. So in April, bitcoin will automatically tighten its monetary policy with no involvement from humans. So we're saying then, maybe then the arbitrary human intervention in markets in May will give us some respite from these high rates. I just want to point out that contrast because I think this is a year of clash. You've got the bitcoin market and phenomenon smashing on Wall street like a wave generational clash happening between young bitcoin people and older generations that now have access. They're calling up to learn about it gold bugs. And you've got the clash happening between traditional market structure and infrastructure and bitcoin infrastructure, which are now combining in some ways.
00:07:43.644 - 00:07:56.562, Speaker A: But you've also got the clash between predictable programmable money and unpredictable, arbitrary money, which is going to play out again in the spring of an election year just like it did in 2020. What do you think about that?
00:07:56.738 - 00:08:20.450, Speaker B: I love that juxtaposition. Thank you. It is phenomenal and it's so crazy. The smartest people in macro, they're all saying in 510 years time, the fiscal deficit is just going to be at the forefront of every conversation. Every conversation. And it's like those guys fully embrace bitcoin. It's game over.
00:08:20.522 - 00:08:27.608, Speaker A: They're going to have a real leg up when it comes to that thing. Bim Netabeebe, our friend from Galaxy trading. Thanks as always for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:08:27.696 - 00:08:28.304, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
