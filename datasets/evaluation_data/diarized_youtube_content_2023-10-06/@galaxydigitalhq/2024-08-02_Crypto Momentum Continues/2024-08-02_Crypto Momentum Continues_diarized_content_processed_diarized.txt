00:00:00.200 - 00:00:15.450, Speaker A: And so now we're at this interesting moment where, you know, I would say we're in a bull market. Like, it's, it's been very positive returns. We had the spot ETF's. We have presidential candidates that are talking. I mean, I'm amazed by that. It's crazy. And my clients are, too, and Swan clients are, too.
00:00:15.450 - 00:00:54.150, Speaker A: And so it's like, but it's still, I think you still see a lot of the momentum, a lot of the interest, a lot of the, it's people that have been in the space for a little while, they already understand it. They're adding to their position, or they've had a smaller position. They're ready to take a larger position. There's definitely net new flow people that are establishing an initial position, but I don't think we've heavily crossed over that inflection point yet. And a lot of the companies I talk to and a lot of the business providers, they're saying a similar thing. Right? Like, people are very positive on bitcoin right now. They're long bitcoin.
00:00:54.150 - 00:00:58.560, Speaker A: They want to be more long bitcoin, but it's generally not people that found out about it a month ago.
