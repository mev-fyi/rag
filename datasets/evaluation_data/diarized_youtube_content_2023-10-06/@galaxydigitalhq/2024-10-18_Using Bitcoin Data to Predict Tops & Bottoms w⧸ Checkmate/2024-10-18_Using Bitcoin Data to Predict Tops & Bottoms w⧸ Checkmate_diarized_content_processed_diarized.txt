00:00:00.720 - 00:00:02.193, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:02.289 - 00:00:03.805, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash.
00:00:04.385 - 00:00:10.961, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US Banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin meeting new all time high.
00:00:11.113 - 00:00:11.985, Speaker C: If you're not long.
00:00:12.065 - 00:00:13.697, Speaker A: If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.881 - 00:00:22.205, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto out there.
00:00:22.865 - 00:00:51.667, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, and we have a great episode for you today. James Checkmatey, you may know him as on Twitter from checkonchain.com One of the world's greatest on chain bitcoin data analysts. He's our guest and we're going to talk about where we are in the cycle, how to use on chain data to both look at the past but also predict the future on bitcoin. It's a fascinating conversation.
00:00:51.667 - 00:01:17.815, Speaker A: We'll also check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy Trading, as always, to talk about markets. And before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet ABB from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:18.615 - 00:01:19.927, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:20.111 - 00:01:41.503, Speaker A: Well, a material uplift in bitcoin price this week we rushed up to 66. Then we came back down a little bit almost. It was the Dalai Lama pattern, if people are familiar with that, earlier in the week. But now bitcoin trading strong just south of the 68k level. Big inflows into the ETFs. What's your take on this?
00:01:41.599 - 00:02:30.806, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's predominantly driven by election odds for Trump continuing to creep higher. I think Poly Market has gotten as high as 60% as of today, which is Wednesday. And so I think in terms of the election trades that folks are looking at, crypto is expected to be a huge beneficiary of a change in administration. And so folks are basically doing the calculation of what are Trump's odds. Where does bitcoin go to if Trump wins? Let's say that's fresh all time highs, 90K. And where does bitcoin go to in a Kamala Administration, let's say that's south of 60K, let's call it 55K.
00:02:30.950 - 00:02:31.374, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:31.454 - 00:03:23.341, Speaker C: Your midpoint is north of 70K, just on a 50, 50 distribution of outcomes. And so when you start to price in a 60, 40 of that 90, 55 spread, it creeps a lot higher. And so what you've seen happen, I think over the past couple of days is the election is the only thing that matters. And as you get closer to the election, I think bitcoin is basically going to be at that expected value point. And as that expected value of the Trump administration has continued to creep higher, bitcoin has continued to creep higher. And I think there's a lot of folks that have yet to allocate to crypto and bitcoin in a meaningful way. And if they're thinking about the election, once the election outcome is known, the price might just gap up.
00:03:23.341 - 00:04:05.853, Speaker C: So you might not have an opportunity to really participate in the bitcoin upside if you don't have it on already. And so I do think that there's a little bit of that FOMO happening in the market. In conjunction with that, you've had an incredibly positive, you know, broader risk backdrop. You know, we've had some de escalation in the geopolitical tensions. You still have, you know, the S P and NASDAQ trading well, although you did have a little bit of a hit yesterday, but you're still basically only a percent off all time highs in the S P. So it's a very good risk environment. You still have the precious metal backdrop continuing to do well.
00:04:05.853 - 00:04:45.003, Speaker C: Silver's on the cusp of a pretty big breakout. Gold's trading incredibly well. You've got softening inflation across the world, Europe in the uk, Canada, Australia. There's a ton of places where the inflationary story is calming down and growth concerns are starting to become more prominent. And so that generally leads to a shift towards more monetary easing. And that's what you're seeing reflected broadly in risk appetite. And that's all helping bitcoin trade pretty well at the moment.
00:04:45.099 - 00:05:31.555, Speaker A: Yeah, you know what's interesting is if you think about the prior all time high from 2021 being 69,000 or around there, that would be about $80,000 in today, $2024, you know, if we follow CPI as the measure. So we're really, we really didn't sort of make an all time high in that sense yet, which actually helps me sort of my mental model of where we are in a supposed cycle make a lot more sense to me. Right. We're sort of, we're, we're more in like fall 2020 than say, you know, coming off an all time high, trying to make another higher high. In my mind, I think people still are sort of anchored to that $2020 before all this inflation happened. You know, do people by the.
00:05:31.595 - 00:05:32.763, Speaker C: It's a very bad point.
00:05:32.819 - 00:05:33.011, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:33.043 - 00:05:41.175, Speaker A: Do people think about that, by the way? I mean in say traditional markets? I mean it seems like a really important point. Like when we say, you know, I saw. Yeah.
00:05:43.315 - 00:06:32.581, Speaker C: I think that's, it's an incredibly important point. I do think it's one that is underappreciated by the market. And so I think that's entirely valid. The other thing I would also cite is you've had a ton of supply overhang that's been absorbed by the market. Whether it's GBTC outflows that happened, whether it was Mount Gox flows, whether it was German government selling, whether it was US Government selling, Chinese government selling and folks looking to take profit at all time highs through 65K. So there's been a ton of sell pressure that's already been absorbed by the market. And in theory, you know, it should be a transition from weak hands to stronger hands.
00:06:32.581 - 00:06:49.917, Speaker C: And that's, that's effectively what's happened, happened in bitcoin over time. And so I do think you've just got such a clean setup here, especially on a Trump victory where, you know, you will see bitcoin break to all time highs. Inflation adjusted. Yeah, hopefully.
00:06:50.021 - 00:06:50.705, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:51.045 - 00:08:06.099, Speaker C: And, but yeah, I think that's just a super salient point. And I think, you know, thinking through the election like there's going to be some inflation that comes out of either administration, I would say, you know, they're both very inflationary policies. Trump, you know, primarily because if you're going to slap tariffs on everyone and you're talking about super high tariffs, that's inflationary. You're talking about deporting millions of folks that are in our labor force, that's inflationary to the labor market and you're talking about tax relief and reducing taxes on tip earners and folks that have auto debt and et cetera. And then you know, on the, on the comma side as well, even though, you know, they're, they're trying to raise taxes to offset some of, some of the spending policies. But generally speaking, like both of these administrations are going to spend a lot of money and they're going to drive like inflationary policy. And so you know that, that monetary debasement thesis, you know, I think holds true for either party and that that should bode well for, for you know, store of value like bitcoin.
00:08:06.187 - 00:08:33.464, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be interesting and then your thoughts here. I've been saying that we've got bitcoin dominance at cycle highs like 58% which is kind of a silly metric. You should probably take stables out of that or other weird long tail assets. It's sort of fundamentally higher than that. It's not the highest it's ever been. But the question is. Or you take ebtc which is also painting near multi year lows call by the way.
00:08:33.464 - 00:09:09.775, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. I've been a long time short on eth btc, but I think my, I've been thinking about this a lot more and I think it's pretty clear to me that a Trump administration, assuming it comes with a material easing of the crypto regulatory frameworks for cryptos broadly, would it should support altcoins sort of in an outsized way when compared to bitcoin which itself has very little sort of business before the regulators. Like I'm sort of predicting that ETHC bottoms and bitcoin dominance tops in the event of a Trump victory. What are your thoughts on that take?
00:09:11.235 - 00:10:36.873, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think initially you're spot on because the deregulation sort of tailwinds should support up the other assets. But I think over time crypto investors have gotten a lot smarter about where they allocate their capital and kind of the flows that are associated with a lot of these alt tokens, particularly in the context of just the sheer amount of supply that unlocks on any given day and kind of some of the venture based strategies that are out there. And so while I do think that Trump victory should help a lot of these know tokens, particularly ones that you know, are like, you know, might actually have a real chance at getting an ETF product. You know, while I think that is true, I think the underpinnings of, you know, kind of what those tokens are about and the supply dynamics, I don't necessarily know how much it extends. Yep, yeah, sort of, sort of my concern. But high level, I think crypto historically has always traded on the back of bitcoin. And so if bitcoin does trades really well, I think risk appetite will come back into the market and folks will want to speculate on meme tokens and other long tail kind of stuff.
00:10:36.873 - 00:11:17.731, Speaker C: And so when that burst of risk appetite comes through the market, if on the off chance bitcoin breaks all time highs. I do think that those other assets will outperform simply as a function of a dollar of buying an alt token will move it, you know, a higher percentage than buying like a dollar of bitcoin. And so you'll see, you know, just a pickup and market cap across a bunch of alts. And so you know, I do tend to agree with you that, you know, the risk reward on like BTC or bitcoin dominance, you know, favors the other direction at the moment. If you, if you think, you know, Trump, Trump is most likely to win.
00:11:17.803 - 00:11:42.425, Speaker A: Well, it's getting exciting. I think we're just about, we're just under three weeks away from the election and you know, I, it's a, and it's important one. It's definitely crypto's most important election by the way, not just at the presidential but also in the House and Senate. Enormous amounts of money and lobbying being done on, on both sides. And we'll be here to tell you about it. Bimnet Abibi, my friend from Galaxy Trading, thank you so much.
00:11:42.555 - 00:11:43.705, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:11:44.885 - 00:11:50.221, Speaker A: Let's go now to my friend James. Check from check on chain. James, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:11:50.373 - 00:11:52.325, Speaker B: Good day, Alex, thanks for having me on, mate.
00:11:52.485 - 00:12:17.315, Speaker A: Yeah, good day mate. Great to have you on. I was lucky to do your podcast a few weeks ago and I was thinking about we were on stage together in Nashville this past summer and I was thinking about how I have to get you on. You're one of. James is one of the most, gosh, maybe longest tenured and certainly most prolific on chain bitcoin analysts. Has a great website and newsletter. You should check out checkon chain.com
00:12:17.315 - 00:12:39.387, Speaker A: lots to ask you about James, but you started your bitcoin career at Glassnode. You know, we're a subscriber to and user of Glassnode among many others and well known for their on chain analysis which you were sort of the main public spokesperson about for a long time. What was it like? How'd you get to Glass Node? What got you interested in on chain bitcoin analysis?
00:12:39.531 - 00:13:25.179, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. So I was around the on chain world for about as long as it's been around. So way back in late 2018, CoinMetrics released the realized cap and this basically the on chain market cap, right. Valuing every coin at the price when it last moved and suddenly you've got this whole new world where it's like, oh, so we can see profit taking, loss taking, cost basis. And it was kind of a bit Fortuitous, because I started, I think I've probably got the oldest, the, the very, very first like on chain educational YouTube video where it was like me sitting in a tin can with my horrific mic explaining to people like, what is the realized cap? What is NVT ratio? And over time it came to about February 2021. My background, civil engineering. So I used to design specifically tunnels, mines, basements, anything underground that was my specialty.
00:13:25.179 - 00:13:55.179, Speaker B: And I was living in London at the time. And bitcoin itself, right, started to really click to it in 2019 on chain. I discovered in 2018, 19, 20. And you know, as many of us, it starts at 5% of your brain power becomes 10, becomes 20, becomes 50. And eventually I'm like, I got to get out of this. I love the engineering work, but I loved bitcoin so much more. And an opportunity kind of came up because I was writing for a small newsletter way back in the day and one of my subscribers said, hey, there's this role for a data scientist at Glass Node.
00:13:55.179 - 00:14:35.577, Speaker B: And I put my resume in which, you know, the first thing I said, I said, first of all, I'm not a data scientist, but what I do know is what these metrics actually do. So I think what I came on board to do and built up the analyst team was to build out the interpretation layer. We've got all these tools, we've got all these metrics, we've got all these funky looking things. What do we actually do with them? How do you apply them in a live fire exercise? So I really cut my teeth. I joined in February 2021. For those who were around for that period of time, that meant I had about three months to learn what was going on before the bear market kicked in and we had a 50% sell off and the world started blowing up. But really it was me and my team, we kind of cut our teeth and built out all of these tools, our knowledge of what they do through that bear market.
00:14:35.577 - 00:14:56.965, Speaker B: And then coming into the start of this year, it just felt time I was ready for a new challenge and spun out check on Chain as my own business. And you know, we've essentially been writing a substack and exploring what is now, I think the first bull market where on chain data is properly developed and prepared. So for me it's going to be a learning on the cutting edge experience once again. But at the end of the day that's what I love doing.
00:14:57.385 - 00:15:44.465, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really fascinating. Glass Node has, I would say, picked the mantle up and really advanced A lot of these, whether they're descriptive or derivative metrics that you know, based on, on chain activity. You know, I also learned about. Well, I think Coinmetrics really was the first, you know, website. Yeah, really like pre venture back startup. Nick had a really sloppy but effective, no offense, I don't mean sloppy like very rudimentary data explorer which I think was part of his master's thesis. You know, I, I think the first time I actually got interested in, in trying to figure out, actually putting my head down trying to understand on chain Bitcoin data which by the way I recommend for everybody because you learn how bitcoin works.
00:15:44.465 - 00:16:16.921, Speaker A: Great, great thing to you know, take a, a week and, and try to understand how to use the data. But there was a, I'm trying to look here because I have this old report. So it would have been. Yeah, so in like early late 2018, early 2019 there was, I can't remember the name of this but there was a new like an L1 that started using opreturn to post its data to Bitcoin. Vera Block, that's what it was called, Vera Block. Open timestamps which Peter Todd made had also been using this. But it wasn't a lot of data.
00:16:16.921 - 00:16:57.773, Speaker A: It wasn't a lot of transactions. But all of a sudden there's this huge spike in data and like January 21st being posted to Bitcoin, it was Veri Block. And I was trying to like, I was looking at the naive metrics of just you know, transaction count and trying to understand like what were those transactions. And then the very first, you know, simple step of going deeper on OPERN and different types of, you know, segwit versus non segwit and, and, and that was really just still looking at the data. Even back then 1819, there was still basically just like NVT was one of the few, a few ones. It's maybe let's go a little bit deeper. What can you learn from the data in general? I mean what can this tell you? Right? It's network data.
00:16:57.949 - 00:16:58.485, Speaker B: Yep.
00:16:58.565 - 00:17:02.941, Speaker A: I mean we're not just talking about looking at like transaction fee count or amount.
00:17:03.013 - 00:17:29.915, Speaker B: No, no, I like. And it's funny because you actually have to almost split this between there's Bitcoin and there's everything else. So I definitely specialize in bitcoin. That's where my focus area is. And a lot of these concepts, you can take the ideas but you have to adjust it so we can talk about that at the end of this. I usually split down on chain data into we've got the whole bitcoin supply and we can break it down to three perpendicular axes. The first one is other coins moving or are they stationary, spent, unspent.
00:17:29.915 - 00:17:57.957, Speaker B: And the spent coins, you know, 1% of all coins move on any day. And most of those are the same coin transacting multiple times. So a small fraction of the supply moves most of it. Sit tight, you've then got, are those coins in profit or in loss? So then we have supply and profit, supply and loss, volume in profit, volume in loss. You can see the cost basis. How much profit did it lock in? How much loss did it lock in? How much was the unrealized profit and loss? Everyone holds. And then you can add the third axis, which is a really fascinating one.
00:17:57.957 - 00:18:37.177, Speaker B: It's the cohort axis. By who, who, who are we talking about here? People have held their coins for two weeks, five months, five years. Because if you think about this from a like now let's take those three axes and look at like a tangible use case. I don't particularly care when someone who bought Yesterday takes a 2% loss. I do care when a huge pool of guys who bought in the previous bear market start taking fat profits. Because that's people who have serious conviction making a long term decision at all at the same time, sell side pressure. So that's just a great example of like and how do we measure out these, you know, smart and dumb money? You'll often hear long term, short term holder somewhere around the five to six month mark.
00:18:37.177 - 00:19:13.507, Speaker B: If a coin's been held that long, it's going to stay that way. And then when they start spending, you pay attention. So you know, that's just how I like to break this thing down, right? Are they moving, are they not? Are they in profit or are they in loss? And by who? And if you take that cross section, you can basically look at all sorts of different problems. I want to see when people who I love doing this, when we're talking about like buying dips, people always buy the local high because the euphoria is there. Everyone's super excited, right? Because going to a million dollars, it's usually going down about 30% when that's the sentiment. So you see these guys who buy high and they usually hold it and we've all done this. You buy it, you hold it, you hold it, keeps dipping, dip keeps dipping.
00:19:13.507 - 00:19:27.735, Speaker B: Then eventually you go, I can't do this anymore. And you capitulate. Don't worry, I'll buy it back lower and more often. Than not, that is the bottom. So you can kind of see those guys too, right? Show me when the fast money makes the right and the wrong decision. And you can then adjust your framework accordingly.
00:19:28.645 - 00:19:46.665, Speaker A: Is the effectiveness of this type of analysis affected by say if people use it as a medium of exchange rather than sort of an investment, or if they hold their Bitcoin at a custodian or an etf? Like how, how does the evolving use of Bitcoin or has it evolved?
00:19:47.165 - 00:20:16.145, Speaker B: No, this is a great question. When I get all the time. And the truth is, as with all data, there's going to be error bars, right? Some guy who locked in a profit was actually just moving his coins from a cold card to a ledger, right? So there are going to be these internal spends, the way I like to frame this up. And there are the custodians, the exchanges, the ETFs. That's kind of one topic of interest. But then there's also just these like, just general error bars. When I look at on chain data, I think the best way to describe it is if you're going to do a population survey, I want to understand the demographics of this population.
00:20:16.145 - 00:20:53.597, Speaker B: You don't survey every single person in the population, you survey a statistically large subset. There's going to be some errors in that as well. And you extrapolate. So in this particular case, where our sample size is 100% of coins moving, right? Every single coin in the entire Bitcoin supply, that's our sample size, there's going to be coins that are long term holders, that sit in an exchange wallet that are in profit. Okay, that's fine, right? Sometimes they'll transact, sometimes they won't. But when you really take the aggregate and you average all this stuff, most of those error bars collapse. So some guy may buy his coin at 60,000 and actually withdraw at 58, but some other guy deposited at 56 and is withdrawing at 58.
00:20:53.597 - 00:21:15.233, Speaker B: So they all kind of balance out. And the long term averages are actually really smooth. Now when we look at things like custodians, this is really where you've got two different data sets. And Glass Node really pioneered a lot of this stuff is what we call entity adjustment. And the idea is you can look at the supply and say, well, we've got a whole data science team who's saying this is binance. This is how Binance behaves. Mr.
00:21:15.233 - 00:21:48.335, Speaker B: Algorithm, go and find all of the transactions that look like Binance and cluster them together. So then you can say, well, I want to look at all these metrics, excluding exchanges or excluding ETFs so you can filter the data. There are some challenges in terms of like, you know, if you're a general hodler, you probably don't need that kind of granularity. If you're a more high frequency trader and you actually want to see money moving between these entities because it's economically useful for you, then you can start going into that entity adjustment. But it is a more expensive data set, but you can obviously get very, very unique insights out of it.
00:21:48.375 - 00:22:26.297, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super interesting and I love your point about long term. One of the simplest ones to explain, which you already did, was the long term holders taking profit. And we see this when we look at the long term coins in size, in terms of volume of coins moving, like effectively creating the top in 2017, creating a top in 2021. And you can see that. And you guys both glassnode, but also on checkonchain.com, you've done a great job sort of aggregating and even drawing those like a shaded bar. It's almost like the recession bar in an economic chart that shows you like this was like top selling, like top right, like.
00:22:26.297 - 00:23:10.637, Speaker A: And you could see the. And so when I sort of pivot and by the way, actually before I get to the. That leads perfectly into what I want to get really into, which is sort of where are we now? Are we seeing that now? But real quick, just another example, you know Razzle Khan, the, the crocodile of Wall street, one of the people indicted for hacking Bitfinex in 2016. She or they, they removed 120,000 Bitcoin from Bitfinex in 2016. And then they were caught in, I think in 2022. And the feds moved a lot of coins on chain that had previously not been moved. Right.
00:23:10.637 - 00:23:39.017, Speaker A: What was? I mean, I don't know, 120,000, I think in August 2016 is probably about 3 or 400, 500 bucks a coin. And when they moved later in February 22, it was worth 4 billion. So that looks like long term holders, like cashing out or one of the ones. My favorite metrics is Coin Days destroyed and its various derivatives. It's really just another way of calculating sort of the same thing. Our old, our large volumes like a.
00:23:39.041 - 00:23:41.177, Speaker B: Volume of holding time expelled from the market.
00:23:41.241 - 00:23:47.525, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. In fact, what is Coin Days Destroyed? Just briefly, like you, you add up every day.
00:23:47.825 - 00:24:19.061, Speaker B: Coin days destroyed. It's one of my favorite metrics because it helps me. It's how we define Long term holder, short term holder. Many people have probably seen the Hodl ways, right, split up the whole supply by how long it's been held. So if you buy two Bitcoin, you hold it for one year, you're going to have two times 365 coin days in that coin when you spend it. Those coin days are destroyed and its lifespan resets to zero and starts reticking higher. So going back to our previous example, when you see lots of coin day destruction at the same time, you look at realized profit and usually they correlate.
00:24:19.061 - 00:24:24.493, Speaker B: You've got lots of profit taking by old coins. That's a signal, that's a piece of information you can use.
00:24:24.669 - 00:25:03.649, Speaker A: Yeah, it's good. It aggregates both the length of holding and the amount of coins into one metric. But this was an interesting one because I remember before it wasn't announced the day that it moved and I saw this coin days destroy metric like fly off the chart. It's one of the biggest ever, I think February, whatever date it was in February 22nd. If you go on Glass Node or any other site that has this, you'll see it's like the top five coin days destroyed days ever. And I'm looking at it like, well we're already like coming down from the all time high of November 21st. Somebody like now capitulating, right? And then you know, a couple days later we find out that the Fed seized all this coin.
00:25:03.649 - 00:25:14.033, Speaker A: And I'm like oh, like see that's actually an error bar to your point. In fact, we know they haven't sold those coins. There's the Feds are still holding those coins and we've actually seen a bunch of those recently.
00:25:14.089 - 00:25:41.875, Speaker B: We've seen Mt. Gox move, we've seen WBTC just move their 150,000 Bitcoin recently. And no, this, this is a great example of if you look at, actually I did a study, I looked at some of glass nodes data. You can actually see when their balance goes down. And then the algorithm goes, oh, hang on a second, that was an internal spend and then lifts back up again. So that's where the entity adjustment comes into it. The way that I like to frame it is because my data I generally use just unfiltered because it doesn't move around, doesn't change.
00:25:41.875 - 00:26:01.359, Speaker B: You're not looking at like, oh, that actually turned out to be binance. So I kind of mentally account for those things. I'm like okay, when you see these very vertical moves in any kind of data set, you'll see this all the time, right? Exchange balances will drop by 500,000 coins. Everyone's like, oh, man, you know, supply shockers. Like, guys, that's an error. Like, it's really clear. Very vertical moves.
00:26:01.359 - 00:26:03.439, Speaker B: Very, very infrequently. Are they real?
00:26:03.607 - 00:26:07.863, Speaker A: Right? And then you can use averaging or just like you said, intuition, mentally.
00:26:07.999 - 00:26:08.583, Speaker B: Yep.
00:26:08.679 - 00:26:41.179, Speaker A: Yeah. And it makes sense, too. It's one thing if, you know, if you're an analyst providing this, like, you can sort of manually. I kind of like that too. I've used, I don't think actually I've ever myself published metrics from Glass Node or Coinmetrics or anyone else in my research that uses proprietary algorithms to adjust the data set. Mostly just because even if they, you know, I know the people at Glass owned and at Coin Metrics, they explain it to me, but I'm still like, well, that's kind of your proprietary metric. So maybe I'll even.
00:26:41.179 - 00:26:54.583, Speaker A: I'll sort of conduct the same intuition. Like, sometimes I'll compare their entity adjustment versus the raw data and be like, okay, like, smart people that do algorithms with this data say, there might be something to it. Let me see what else I can get.
00:26:54.719 - 00:27:25.089, Speaker B: It's why I often say to people that whale watching is usually not a sport that I'm a huge fan of. Because if you go whale watching, right, the problem is when you look at shrimp and when I say shrimp, you know, retail holders, people with less than, you know, a couple hundred grand or whatever, they all move as a big amorphous blob. We all kind of do the same thing. There's like five different ways you can possibly dca. We all do the same thing. If you're a whale, there's like 5, 200, 5000 of these guys. And if they move a single wallet, they could be breaking a thousand coins into many tens or hundred utx.
00:27:25.089 - 00:27:44.177, Speaker B: There's all sorts of stuff they could do, move between custodians and because there's so few of them, but they have so many coins. You see this on Twitter all the time. People like, oh, no, Mr. 100 is buying coins. It's like, well, Mr. 100 is probably an exchange, and it is actually an exchange, so that buying is actually someone else depositing. So your interpretation is perfectly backwards.
00:27:44.177 - 00:27:58.049, Speaker B: If you don't know, it's not really worth using. So while watching, I generally tell people to avoid. On the big scale of like, what's the Hodler doing? Much clearer. Because we all do the same thing. There's only a handful of Behavior patterns and we all behave the same way.
00:27:58.217 - 00:28:35.675, Speaker A: Yeah, very interesting. Okay, so let's move forward to the current market. You know, you've been describing it to your readers as chop solidation, I think, I love that it has. We're not gonna, I don't do the whole like put. Because we're mostly an audio podcast, we don't put like graphics up typically on the screen, but I think our audience will know. Bitcoin's been basically in a slowly descending channel since making an all time high in March of 2024, with basically slightly lower highs over and over again. I think we might have technically just made a slightly higher high, but we're still definitely in that descending channel.
00:28:35.675 - 00:28:54.359, Speaker A: What, what does the data tell you? What is your, as an analyst in general, your intuition? Where are we, do you think you're going to be? Not even where are we in the big cycle, which I'll maybe get to. But do you think that, you know, when will we break out or what will you see that tells us that we're ready to break out or that we are breaking out of this pattern?
00:28:54.527 - 00:29:11.121, Speaker B: For sure. Yeah. So. So the name chop Solidation actually comes from the only technical analysis metric that I really use personally as like part of my, like this is part of my information set. And it's actually a very. There's an obscure one called the Choppiness Index. And the Choppiness Index was originally developed by an Australian, which is probably why it works.
00:29:11.121 - 00:29:39.325, Speaker B: And it's based on the commodities market. And the idea is that markets need to take breathers, right? You can rally for a period of time. Markets don't go up in a straight line, nor do they go down in a straight line. And we had, you know, 18 months thereabouts from the FTX bottom all the way through. You know, we had a bit of a quiet patch in the middle and then the ETFs came in. It was kind of this uninterrupted leg higher 18 months. And the Choppiness index, which basically looks at how many candles over the last, you know, I use 10 periods in the monthly scale.
00:29:39.325 - 00:30:28.539, Speaker B: How many of those candles are all within the same range? And when you've got 10 months of it just going in one direction, it's basically telling you this trend is tired, it needs a rest. How do you recharge it? You either correct and fill it back, fill in the area where you've just been or you trap, chop sideways. So my case was we get into March, I think we started writing the newsletter in April, mid April. And it was, look, by May we said, look, the choppiness index is completely and utterly exhausted on a monthly scale. That means we've probably got something on the order of six to whatever months ahead of us of just choppy corrective. We're probably not going to go anywhere, right? We're probably not going higher and you know, to be honest, right, chop solidation was the original theme, but it just got more and more chop solidation as we went along, right. It was actually I was surprised myself with how like just close it actually was.
00:30:28.539 - 00:31:06.625, Speaker B: But here we are getting towards the end of. It's been seven months but within that seven month period the choppiness index is now completely recharged because we've chopped sideways, we've chopped wood, We've literally got the market to exhaust all of that, you know, speculation and skepticism. Now there's, there's a really cool metric that I use the pairs with that in the on chain world it's called the sell side risk ratio. And we were talking before about realized profit, realized loss. And what we do is we compare how much realized profit and losses in a volume sense and divide it by the realized cap. And the other way to think about this, investors who are going to take profit have done so. Investors who are going to take loss have done so.
00:31:06.625 - 00:31:35.633, Speaker B: So the market's gone dead quiet. So what that tells you is we've reached equilibrium. The market has to go somewhere else to motivate the next round of spending. It could be a horrendous sell off where everyone just capitulates and throws in the towel and losses kick higher. It could also be starting to move higher and people start to take profit again. But either way it's saying we're done, everyone is acclimatized, we've reached equilibrium in this 50, 60K range. And you know, as we started to shift around, you mentioned this kind of polarity shift as I call it.
00:31:35.633 - 00:32:19.031, Speaker B: We set a technical higher high on the daily and it's pulled back and now we've got a technical higher high on the weekly. And this is one of those things where the reversal from a bull market to a bear market or vice versa, it starts on the 1 second chart, then it propagates up to the hourly chart, then the four hour and then the daily. And the whole purpose of the chop solidation thesis for my subs was just to help people set their expectations. This looks like a monthly bull flag. It's going to take a period of months to do its thing and you go on Twitter and everyone looks at the last daily candle, gets completely absorbed by the red and the green. It's over, we're back, it's over, we're back. But if just go on a monthly scale, we got to recharge this thing and we got to that point, sell side risk ratio was at the lows.
00:32:19.031 - 00:32:44.665, Speaker B: Chop solidation had done its thing and we're, we're kind of at this point like, okay, well now it's going to go somewhere. And you know, at the, at the most simple level, the bears had seven months to take us lower and they got us to 26% as a drawdown on like a closing basis. There was a short 32% on the yen carry trade. And like me as a bitcoiner, I look at that, I'm like, is that all you got? You know, like some of my bias has to be towards the upside because the bears just didn't do enough damage.
00:32:45.045 - 00:33:18.305, Speaker A: Yeah. Is this a dip for ants, you wonder? I mean bitcoin's had multiple like 80 plus percent drawdowns in its history. Yeah. And that's another interesting thing too because it makes me feel like some people were wondering in March, I remember when there was exuberance and the bitcoin made a new all time high and the ETFs were absolutely flooded with, with inflows. They said, oh, did we pull forward the cycle? Did we? We hadn't even hit the having yet. And typically, you know, historically bitcoin had done its having and then maybe like six to eight months after a real bull run starts to materialize. But then it happened so much sooner.
00:33:18.305 - 00:33:27.545, Speaker A: It happened even before the bull run. And then people were wondering and asking me, well wait, what if that was the bull run? Like it was actually sooner and shorter, right?
00:33:27.625 - 00:33:28.245, Speaker B: Yes.
00:33:28.545 - 00:33:50.623, Speaker A: But if it was right, there was no blow off top. It wasn't. There was no mass capitulation event. It has been this chop solidation. So maybe that's the segue. Is this, where are we in the cycle? Are we in the middle? If is there a cycle and where are we in it? Is there? I mean obviously we can start with the FTX low. It's like November 10th or 8th or 12th somewhere in there if I recall.
00:33:50.623 - 00:34:13.085, Speaker A: 2022 and we pretty much do slowly rise with some hick some boring times through all of 23. And then obviously in the fall of 23 we basically just start ripping on the Bitcoin ETF anticipation. What is that? Is that the, is that like a 2019, like June 2019? And maybe the real bull run is yet to come.
00:34:13.245 - 00:34:31.037, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think this is a really interesting topic. So I think we've talked about this before. My base case, I try to hold both views at the same time. One bitcoin has this four year cycle. People are going to operate thinking there's a four year cycle. It will probably be a four year cycle until it doesn't. And if there's ever a time for it to not be a four year cycle, this is probably it.
00:34:31.037 - 00:34:40.069, Speaker B: There are so many. I actually went, I did an exercise where I went all the way back to the start of the bitcoin price on like a one or one and a half year zoom on trading view and I just scrolled left to right.
00:34:40.117 - 00:34:44.205, Speaker A: It's like July 18, like 2010 or something I think is the first price.
00:34:44.245 - 00:35:11.661, Speaker B: Exactly. And I went through every single period in bitcoin's history looking for another equivalent chop solidation and the only one that I could find was 2019. And even then there's a lot of differences. This kind of mid cycle echo bubble some, some people call, call it. And this concept with 2019 is it really was this like sideways downwards grind with March 2020 there, which I think a lot of people look at and go holy. Like we don't want to go through that again. But 2019 had a lot more of these really nasty sell offs.
00:35:11.661 - 00:35:33.031, Speaker B: Like the downside was much angrier. I remember living through it. That's where I, I mean that's where I learned that options can kill people. Right. That's where I lost a whole lot of money and paid that tuition. But you know, that 2019 period is probably the closest. I ran a very interesting study looking at the inflation actually trying to see like, you know, I think most people, we look at the price, that's what we see.
00:35:33.031 - 00:36:09.037, Speaker B: But what do we feel like emotionally? What do we feel? I think most people, when you go to the grocery store and you see, you're like God, that's expensive. You're probably referring back to your 2020 purchasing power when you know inflation was on a different regime. So I ran a study saying well let's just assume that CPI or times 2 times 3 CPI. Like we don't know what the real inflation rate is because it's all masked by numbers. But let's just say three times CPI is probably about right. Right. They're under reporting by 3x when you run that study and say well what is the current price? What does it feel like here at 60k or 65k it feels a lot more like 35 to 40.
00:36:09.037 - 00:36:50.351, Speaker B: That's like in our 2020 purchasing power, which is the exact same drawdown that the 2019 peak got to mid cycle. So yes, we're up at the previous cycle all time high. But in purchasing power terms we're down 40 odd percent. So we paid for kind of our sins, right? For this March all time high, we paid for our sins with about 26% worth of actual drawdown and an additional 15, 16, 17% in just inflation cost. So it's one of these like hidden taxes that sits under the surface. Now as we kind of went through this chop solidation period, my kind of case for a bear, how do I look for a bear market? Because. Because that really is the distinguishing factor between like the cycle dies when the bear arrives.
00:36:50.351 - 00:37:38.905, Speaker B: And my kind of framework is I want to find when too many people bought too many coins at too high of a price. And we were talking about on chain data before we can see the cost basis, we can see the unrealized loss, we can see how much like financial pain people are under. Now where we got to in terms of unrealized loss, Think about every single coin that was bought at 70,073, there's some Delta, right? They bought one Bitcoin, they're down 5% some all of that unrealized loss, how big is it? How much of the bitcoin market cap is a loss? And where we got to at the deepest point through this chop solidation period was about 6, 7%. Now if you go back to mid-2021 on that mid, that sell off in May, right. China bans mining. The market pretty much halved in a month. We saw that go to 20%.
00:37:38.905 - 00:38:09.777, Speaker B: And across every single metric from that point on it had bear market properties. Even though we went to an all time high in November, we were in bear market territory. So I knew that like and again none of this is an exact science, but I knew that if you put 20 of the market cap underwater, that's bear market creating. That just kills the bulls spirit. In bull market corrections all through the past five, six, seven. That's very typical. So in this chop solidation we kind of got that 5, 6, 7 level of unrealized loss.
00:38:09.777 - 00:38:37.965, Speaker B: And here we are looking like we want to break higher. So we're trying to like narrow in. It's like okay, the bitcoin holders, they can handle 5 to 7% losses. They're not a fan of 20%. So somewhere in that gray zone between 7 and 20 is like bear market, creating material now just to kind of go through that final. What does the next chapter look like? I generally look at the market following a bear market, which if anyone's been through a bitcoin bear, you know, it's a brutal process and there's a recovery time frame. Right.
00:38:37.965 - 00:39:14.259, Speaker B: It takes time for capital, the ptsd, all of these things are just going to heal. And if you look at every single previous cycle this duration, about 700 days since the bottom is about how long it takes to really kick start the thing into the next, the next wave. Now once we bust through all time high, we enter what I call the euphoria phase. This is when we truly start moving. Right. This is the parabolic phase everyone looks at. I believe that there's like a time frame on that because if anyone's been through a bull, you know that you get to the end of it and you're exhausted, you're just tired, everything's going higher and you're like, you know what, I just want to go on holidays.
00:39:14.259 - 00:39:30.815, Speaker B: Like every coin under the sun's moving. There's only so long investors can do that for. Historically it's been between six and 18 months. So we haven't hit that euphoric phase. But once we do, I do think there's probably like a time there's only so long investors can do that before they just, they're wiped out and they're tired.
00:39:31.185 - 00:39:54.969, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. And I should point out that one of my favorite quotes, F. Scott Fitzgerald said, the test of a first rate intelligence, the ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. Yeah, you know, you're so right. I think it's. You think about the length of 2017's like sort of bull run, right? Like in like May. I think we were in like 1 or 2k.
00:39:54.969 - 00:40:12.971, Speaker A: May 2017, we had a massive like 50% correction. I recall I was fishing with friends over Labor Day. So that's like September 1, 2017. It went from like six to three or something. Or might have been eight to four. I can't, I can't remember actually. Might have even been 4 to 2.
00:40:12.971 - 00:40:23.797, Speaker A: And then of course we ran all the way to 17,000 in mid December. And then in like a day and a half we went to like 20 and then dumped. Right. Like it was.
00:40:23.821 - 00:40:28.385, Speaker B: That's when I bought my first bitcoin. Literally at that high at the absolute top.
00:40:28.805 - 00:41:18.847, Speaker A: But you know, that was exhausting. And we had multiple massive drawdowns and, and then when it really, really went parabolic, it was fast. Right. This is the other thing. Let's talk about the 2021 bull market because I think you were one of the most vocal people saying that sort of the, the April all time high before Elon basically rugged and said that he randomly just found out that bitcoin uses electricity and you were Talking about that 50% drawdown in just a few days. That had a lot of the hallmarks of a true sort of bull run. But then I think you've been one of the people and maybe TXMC as well has said this, who's also a good analyst, that the November 21st run to really what became the all time high, just slightly higher than the April, didn't really look like a retail driven bull run.
00:41:18.847 - 00:41:20.545, Speaker A: Like what happened there?
00:41:20.705 - 00:41:47.795, Speaker B: Oh, this is a fascinating topic and I actually, I've been meaning for some time to write this down because it's, you're right, it's one of those things I've had for a long time. So a lot of people look at the 2021 cycle and I see things like, oh, it was truncated, we should have got to 100K. There's you know, all these. Now what drove the initial leg? Michael Saylor starts buying in August 2020. By December 2020 we're looking like we're going to go to all time high. And within like three months we went from 20 to 60. Right.
00:41:47.795 - 00:42:21.829, Speaker B: Just an absolutely epic run. Now a huge driving force of that was there was 660,000 bitcoin that were acquired by GBTC. The closed end, the closed fund coins are just getting sucked into this thing to try and arb the premium. And the premium went for a premium to a discount. I think it was late February and we had what I call the, and I know TXMC calls it as well the on chain top. This is like the absolute zenith of, of profit taking old coins, moving coin day destruction. Every single thing that you don't want to be buying into happened on that first January peak.
00:42:21.829 - 00:42:58.805, Speaker B: As we came up into February, things were really quietening down and we started getting that rounded top so there's less profit taking, less old coins moving. GBTC goes into a discount and suddenly the market starts curling over. So you've got less sell side pressure but less price appreciation at the same time. So that's telling you the market can't even work through a declining distribution pressure. And as we start, when we talk about what creates a bear market, so many people bought so many coins at Such a high price. That was exactly what happened there. So there's a lot of people who say the China mining ban caused that sell off.
00:42:58.805 - 00:43:30.377, Speaker B: Markets tend to look for any excuse, like when something is bound destined to happen, they're like, oh, that was the financial headline that caused the news. No, this bear market was coming already. We'd already seen the massive influx of capital, that big bid was gone and then all you needed was someone to throw the match. And that's what I think. The Elon and the China mining ban, that was just the match that got thrown in and we went from I think it was like 55 to 29 over the course of like a week or two. Now we did chop around sideways, I think it was like sideways down. So you've got this kind of really nice.
00:43:30.377 - 00:43:58.969, Speaker B: I remember that period sucked. I remember waking up for whatever reason, like one o'clock in the morning. Bitcoin was like 45 when I went to bed and it was 29 when I woke up. So I had to buy a little bit there. But it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. And then we finally did start ripping to that second all time high in October, November. Now this was a very interesting period because I look at things like mvrv, big lower high, which means that we're at a higher price but there's less profit in the system because everyone's got a higher cost basis.
00:43:58.969 - 00:44:26.013, Speaker B: Far more unfavorable transaction volumes was the only thing that was very strange. I'll talk about this in a sec. On chain activity, transaction counts, active addresses, everything was a massive lower high. So it's like this, this doesn't feel like a growth peak. This feels like something a bit weirder now, long after the fact because none of us knew this at the time. When I looked at the transaction volume on bitcoin, it was ripping through the roof. And you're like, well maybe all my other metrics are wrong.
00:44:26.013 - 00:45:00.041, Speaker B: And I believe that there was something wrong with this high until the all time high. And finally I was like, I'm just wrong, my metrics are wrong. I'm obviously reading this incorrectly. What was actually going on is that the coins going from binance to FTX and vice versa was 90% of the transaction volume on bitcoin at that time. I don't know what Alameda and FTX were doing, but they were using and they were responsible for the vast majority of bitcoin transaction activity. And the moment FTX collapsed, volume just went to zero and stayed there for. I mean I think until probably about 12 months ago.
00:45:00.041 - 00:45:22.201, Speaker B: So it was a really, really interesting dynamic where that second high, there's no question that that had like I think the, the high we got in April was the all time high. Certainly on a sentiment basis I don't believe we were truncated. I think that the bid from GBTC disappeared. So we kind of deserve to top out on Coinbase's direct listing. No doubt. It's like a meme top. So 64k was the high.
00:45:22.201 - 00:45:30.605, Speaker B: That second all time high was almost certainly FTX and Alameda trying to bail themselves out. That's what I think it was. And then we had the bear market that followed.
00:45:30.765 - 00:45:55.789, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super interesting. I have to ask you this, although that's very compelling. You know the December 2017 high coincided with the launch of CME futures and then the November 2021 high sort of coincided with the futures ETF launches. Do you like. I mean is that, that may be a market in search of a narrative. I'm not suggesting that futures actually like drive. Can necessarily drive the spot price.
00:45:55.789 - 00:45:58.309, Speaker A: But is that a coincidence you think?
00:45:58.477 - 00:46:20.829, Speaker B: No, I think markets tend to have these memetic tops. Right. The Coinbase direct listing was the pico top of the first high. You've got the ETF launch in the pico top of the November high. I, from my view a lot of this stuff was baked in the cake and then you just need this like initial influx of people going. These, you know this, this futures ETF is going to be the next moon mission. Come on, 100,000 and they get all jump in on the same time.
00:46:20.829 - 00:46:26.085, Speaker B: And that's. It's just that final icing on the cake where you create sellers for the next 12 months.
00:46:26.545 - 00:46:37.473, Speaker A: Yeah, it was. There was some euphoria at least around the initial futures launch on CME in December 17th. So you're right that that actually can help drive the top and create it.
00:46:37.649 - 00:46:42.033, Speaker B: Create buyers and then they're just in the worst. Too many buyers, too high of a price.
00:46:42.209 - 00:46:54.537, Speaker A: Yeah. And a lot of OGs cashed out in 2020. A lot of coins moved. Old coins. Let's talk about that a little bit before we wrap. You gave another good talk. We were on the panel talking about the four year cycle in Nashville.
00:46:54.537 - 00:47:19.285, Speaker A: But you also gave a talk talking about assessing on chain hodler behavior. You know we've talked around this a lot during this conversation. Talked about mention hodl waves. How useful is that? And also what can long term bitcoin investors learn from it so that they don't make you Know, mistakes like capitulating during a Japan yen carry trade unwind or a, you know, a random sort of dip.
00:47:19.825 - 00:47:42.719, Speaker B: Yeah, no 100%. And my talk in, in Nashville, it was basically looking at my old we all learn lessons. Markets are a continual lesson. And many of this, much of the time, in fact, I would argue all the time you're actually fighting against yourself. Because in markets our own natural biases are almost always wrong. Right? It's like in business, every decision that you think is the right decision intuitively is probably the wrong decision. And markets are much the same.
00:47:42.719 - 00:48:01.995, Speaker B: So I looked at myself back in 2018. I mentioned I bought the Pico top in 2017. So I was kind of forged in the 2018 bear market. And I remember like, you know, I would buy high market would sell off and I'd be like, oh, don't worry, I'll sell here and I'll buy back later. And of course that was the local bottom. It would rip higher. I'm like, okay, I'm getting something wrong.
00:48:01.995 - 00:48:20.755, Speaker B: So I go on Twitter and I'd find, oh look, I found this new fandangly indicator. I'm a master of this indicator. Now I know this is telling me that I should go long, buy high dips again. And I kind of look at all of these behaviors that I did and every single decision was incorrect. And then I look at one of my favorite metrics. It's called sopa. Sopr.
00:48:20.755 - 00:49:01.719, Speaker B: It's kind of the SPENT version of mvrv. Tells you the average profit or loss that people are locking in. And anyway, on my slides I didn't put none of the axes, none of the names, no one knew what the metric was. All they saw is that when I was saying I'm bullish, this is the right time to buy, it was very, very green. And that tells me that smart money are taking profit and I'm the one buying it. And then when I'm thinking, you know what I'm going to sell here and buy back later, every single other dumb money investor like myself was doing the exact same thing, taking the loss, thinking they're going to buy it back later. So what we're basically doing with on chain data is getting an X ray vision, right? You can look at what the fast dumb money you're doing, you can look at what the smart long term holders are doing.
00:49:01.719 - 00:49:53.417, Speaker B: And if you kind of, you know, which side of the boat do you want to be on? I probably want to be more aligned with the smart money. So you know, in terms of like how do you make on chain data really useful for people? If the smart money are taking huge amounts of profits and lots of coin days are being destroyed, it's probably not the best time to do your dca, right? You're buying at a time when there's a bunch of guys who know more than you selling a large volume of coins. Conversely, when the people who didn't listen to that step one, who Dubai, when they capitulate low, generally speaking, it's at the bottom of a yen carry trade. It's at the bottom of like a, you know, 53 dip. And I actually posted to my subscribers all my personal DCAs over the course of this chop solidation period. And you know, I didn't pick pico bottoms, but the way I frame it up, right, A lot of mine were like 56, 53, 50 when it got to 49. Like they're that kind of levels.
00:49:53.417 - 00:50:17.275, Speaker B: I'm like, look, let's just imagine I can't predict the future. No one can. Let's imagine the market is just destined, right? It has to go to 30K. It's just, that's just where it's going. I would rather have my coins from 50 and 53 and 56 and then it goes to 30 than 73 and 68 and 69 and then it goes to 30. Because you're just improving your general survivability in the market. And we mentioned unrealized loss.
00:50:17.275 - 00:50:40.347, Speaker B: People can handle a 5 to a 10% drawdown. That's just another day in Bitcoin handling a 30 plus percent. Now you're like, oh God, that really hurts. So the whole idea is you can use on chain data to just put yourself right. I think the best saying, you don't have to outrun the shark, you just have to outswim your best friend, right? You just gotta get in front of him because then someone else is the food. That's the way I like to think about it.
