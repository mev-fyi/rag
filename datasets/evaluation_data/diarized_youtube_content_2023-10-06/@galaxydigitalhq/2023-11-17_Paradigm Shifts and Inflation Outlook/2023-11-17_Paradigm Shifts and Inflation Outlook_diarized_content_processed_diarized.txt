00:00:00.090 - 00:00:11.310, Speaker A: High level. I mean, just to give you like a couple bits of information. Like the Russell was up almost five and a half percent yesterday. Wow. Like literally its best performance of the day, of the year.
00:00:11.380 - 00:00:11.854, Speaker UNK: Yeah.
00:00:11.972 - 00:00:44.530, Speaker A: Right. And Nasdaq's, you know, back to trend highs, almost S and P's 4500 and change. You know, bonds have rallied till, you know, tens are 450. There's inflows into high yield bond etfs. And so you're seeing is folks going really out the risk curve and buying junk, going out the risk curve in terms of duration and buying longer dated paper. And that's kind of what happens when the market gets a sense that the Fed's turning a bit or the data is turning a little bit. And what is that? That's inflationary, not deflationary.
00:00:44.610 - 00:00:46.840, Speaker B: I see. This is why the last mile is so hard.
00:00:47.530 - 00:00:49.078, Speaker A: It becomes such a push pull.
00:00:49.164 - 00:00:55.260, Speaker B: Yeah. You get the good news on inflation, which makes people go out on the risk curve, which can increase inflation. Correct.
