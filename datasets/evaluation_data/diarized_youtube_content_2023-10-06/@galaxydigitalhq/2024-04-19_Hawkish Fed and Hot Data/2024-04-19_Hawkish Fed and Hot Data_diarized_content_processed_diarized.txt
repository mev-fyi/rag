00:00:08.160 - 00:00:12.734, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Bimnet, welcome as always to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.814 - 00:00:14.886, Speaker B: Thanks for having me and welcome back from London.
00:00:14.950 - 00:00:23.910, Speaker A: Thank you. Yes, I was traveling, I went to cheat code in London, Peter McCormack, because we got the real Bedford FC banner over here. Very fun conference shout out to.
00:00:23.942 - 00:00:25.286, Speaker B: And now you're a real football fan.
00:00:25.350 - 00:00:53.160, Speaker A: I am. I've seen actual football be played. Um, it was great. I am back though, and while I was in London, however, um, there was a geopolitical event that's weight on markets. If you look over my shoulder, you see the block clock it. You know, again, it's funny to be saying this at like 61k, but like I look at it, I see the number, I say to myself, bad number, should be higher number. Anyway, let's debate about why, what the causes were of that.
00:00:53.160 - 00:01:01.434, Speaker A: But first, I know there's been a lot of. So there's been macro news and broader markets have been sliding as well now for several weeks, I think. Right, what's going on?
00:01:02.214 - 00:01:55.314, Speaker B: So, one, in terms of sort of us monetary policy, you've had a series of strong data prints with CPI, PPI, and those strong data prints have caused the Fed to kind of react. And more specifically, the commentary from Fed officials has moved from three cuts is appropriate this year and that was what was in the dot plot to two to one. And now you're kind of pricing in like one and a half cuts this year. All in. And we started the year at seven. So the combination of this hawkish Fed speak and hot data has led to a major repricing in the US interest rate curve. And yields across the entirety of the US yield curve have all moved higher.
00:01:55.314 - 00:02:34.364, Speaker B: And as a consequence, the dollar has gained a lot of value, particularly against EM. Countries like dollar, China dollar, Korea dollar, Max G. Ten currency pairs are also moving lower. Euro broke through 107, almost got through 106. And on top of that, what you're seeing in us equity markets is also fairly notable. We've had breaks of the 50 day moving averages, basically three weeks of moving sideways and then down. And some of that weakness in equities is attributable to the bond price action.
00:02:34.364 - 00:03:09.884, Speaker B: But there's another component to it which I think is also very relevant, which is the deterioration of the US consumer in a way, and the subsequent and likely deterioration of earnings. There was a company today, a freight company, and they basically were like, this quarter, our loads are down and their expenses are also high because of things like car insurance, commodities, energy, prices. And so their margins are getting squeezed because people want less stuff.
00:03:10.224 - 00:03:16.704, Speaker C: And in order to do the exact same activity, the cost of that has gone up.
00:03:16.824 - 00:03:22.448, Speaker B: And there are also a couple of consumer discretionary companies, retailers that have given.
00:03:22.496 - 00:03:31.304, Speaker C: Guidance recently, and that guidance has been not so great. And so there's actually genuine concern about the US consumer.
00:03:31.384 - 00:03:34.696, Speaker A: Wow. But hadn't the consumer been remarkably strong for a long time?
00:03:34.720 - 00:03:36.184, Speaker B: They had been remarkably strong.
00:03:36.264 - 00:03:40.340, Speaker C: However, what's happening is inflation's actually starting.
00:03:40.372 - 00:03:43.988, Speaker B: To take a bite from their ability to consume.
00:03:44.116 - 00:03:46.396, Speaker C: And what that's related to is basically.
00:03:46.540 - 00:03:48.784, Speaker B: What I like to think of necessity, inflation.
00:03:49.204 - 00:03:55.668, Speaker C: What are some of the components that are rising the hottest right now? Home insurance, car insurance, medical costs.
00:03:55.716 - 00:04:01.704, Speaker A: Things are in many cases mandated by law to buy correct gas prices.
00:04:02.604 - 00:04:06.946, Speaker C: You're feeling it. You look at the Big Mac index, that's up a lot more than headline.
00:04:07.010 - 00:04:20.978, Speaker A: CPI, and I don't want to pick on them in specific. Remember there was the $5 foot long and now there's the $6.06 inch. That's inflation, that's more expensive and it's half. No, it really is true, though. That's literally the sandwich that like.
00:04:21.026 - 00:04:23.746, Speaker C: Yeah, to be clear, that's how I measure my inflation.
00:04:23.930 - 00:04:33.580, Speaker A: I'm just saying, like, it used to be a dollar five for twelve for a giant one, and now it's more expensive for half as much. Yes, but yes. So people are filling it in food too.
00:04:33.652 - 00:04:44.332, Speaker C: Yeah. And so what's happening is that discretionary spending that's taking a hit. And people are already at sort of like lower savings rate and lower saving.
00:04:44.388 - 00:04:47.004, Speaker B: Base in the US because people have just been consuming so much and so.
00:04:47.044 - 00:04:51.444, Speaker C: Much, and wages aren't keeping up with inflation anymore.
00:04:51.484 - 00:04:52.580, Speaker A: So they're running out of money.
00:04:52.652 - 00:04:53.020, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:53.092 - 00:04:59.556, Speaker A: They're not buying as much, so the earnings can be bad, but at the same time, inflation is still actually now rising again.
00:04:59.660 - 00:05:00.132, Speaker B: Correct.
00:05:00.228 - 00:05:06.404, Speaker A: So they can't cut as much, which means risk has been going down.
00:05:06.564 - 00:05:08.740, Speaker C: It's pretty, like, it's not a good picture.
00:05:08.772 - 00:05:32.216, Speaker A: It's not great. I wanna give you your laurels a little bit here, too. I think I mentioned this on last week's pod, but you've been saying for months that they shouldn't, it shouldn't have been seven cuts at the time. I recall you saying, well, first of all, just like, even when the data was much better, you're like, there's no need for the cuts. Like, the economy is doing well and it's almost like, well, maybe you would. This is where they start to get into the rock and the hard place really bad. Right.
00:05:32.216 - 00:05:47.344, Speaker A: Because it's like, well, if the economy, the real economy, the everyday people, their costs, like the, for their rent, their houses, their food, like maybe they need some relief. And like, that could be cuts. But if you cut, maybe inflation goes higher. Yeah.
00:05:47.384 - 00:05:58.100, Speaker B: So they're dealing with an insane credibility issue right now. And so when Powell came out and was like, oh, we're still cutting three, and we're like, it doesn't really make.
00:05:58.132 - 00:05:59.708, Speaker C: Any sense to cut three.
00:05:59.876 - 00:06:00.252, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:00.308 - 00:06:06.148, Speaker C: Like the market is starting to challenge their credibility. And the way you see it challenged.
00:06:06.236 - 00:06:08.900, Speaker B: In markets is some of this interest rate pricing.
00:06:08.932 - 00:06:09.836, Speaker C: But what I like to look at.
00:06:09.860 - 00:06:14.820, Speaker B: As well is inflation sort of expectations and market based inflation expectations.
00:06:14.972 - 00:06:41.992, Speaker C: And basically over the past couple of months, you've seen implied inflation tick, tick higher and higher. And so the market was basically like calling the Fed's bluff in a way, being like, guys, do you think doing what you're currently doing is going to cause inflation to come down? No, the expectations started to move higher and then you start getting into the terminal state of this. What does this look like a couple.
00:06:42.008 - 00:06:43.080, Speaker B: Of years from now?
00:06:43.192 - 00:07:10.176, Speaker C: And the fiscal situation is really insane right now. I heard today that it's April 20, so we were probably 150 days into the year or something like, like that. And the, that deficit's already one and a half trillion dollars. We're, I think, on pace for something like four. No, like two and a half on the year, which is still a lot. A lot. And I think that's what you're kind of seeing in like, commodity prices right now.
00:07:10.176 - 00:07:34.560, Speaker C: The gold, the silver charts are some of the most compelling things I've ever seen. Silver is about to be at a five. I think it's around a five year high, and it's breaking out. Gold is obviously at fresh all time highs, and that's in the face of a way stronger dollar, much higher real rates. And so you're seeing that correlation breakdown that we all, you know, we talked about in the context of bitcoin, but you're seeing that correlation breakdown in gold.
00:07:34.672 - 00:07:35.272, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:07:35.368 - 00:07:36.760, Speaker C: And like, I'm literally, the world is.
00:07:36.792 - 00:07:41.872, Speaker A: Basically like, avoiding or dumping us debt or buying, asking for, you know, to be cheaper.
00:07:41.968 - 00:07:42.360, Speaker B: Yes.
00:07:42.432 - 00:07:45.368, Speaker A: Yeah. While paying more for gold. I mean, there. Yes. Yeah.
00:07:45.496 - 00:08:10.200, Speaker C: And there are central banks buying this stuff. Like, why it's so compelling is that these central banks that have money printers are using those money printers to buy real assets like gold and silver. So that's why bitcoin, if it is going to be in that realm of assets, real money, debasement hedges. It's got such a promising future because the macro world is freaking out right now.
00:08:10.232 - 00:08:12.576, Speaker B: And that's why gold is ripping.
00:08:12.640 - 00:08:30.454, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about bitcoin and the crypto complex too, because I mean, bitcoin is at these prices, maybe like 18 or 20% off its all time high, which was 73, eight or so, I guess, only several weeks ago. I've written about this. That's actually extremely common during the major bull runs. We've seen like 30%.
00:08:30.494 - 00:08:30.774, Speaker B: Correct speaker one.
00:08:30.774 - 00:08:55.274, Speaker A: Yeah, like seven or eight of them sometimes. Right. Like, so, like, okay, like for context, that's fine. Also, it has dipped historically before the having, which is, you know, in just a day or two away. But also the geopolitics, the iranian retaliatory missile attack on Israel happened last Saturday. All the other world's markets are closed, basically. But bitcoin was open and it dropped significantly.
00:08:55.274 - 00:09:15.544, Speaker A: Right on the headline. Right, correct. But then I would say the market opened on Monday. Eventually I was like, so did bitcoin. How much of this? Obviously, we sort of trending below all time highs before. But is this a reaction to. It's a risk asset.
00:09:15.544 - 00:09:36.172, Speaker A: I am able to sell it over the weekend. And then bitcoin, struggling to recover from that sale up in the 68, 69 area because people are like, well, maybe it was a little overheated. How do you think about where bitcoin is? Or is it sort of just noise? It's still at this point, to be clear, it's 61k is a nice, healthy, high bitcoin price.
00:09:36.228 - 00:09:58.104, Speaker B: But I think last year we were here this time and we were talking 22. Yeah. And so it's obviously had a huge run. And that basically highlights the fact that there's a lot of long positioning in the asset. And so I think what you've had over the past couple of weeks is just a healthy flush out of positioning, consolidation.
00:09:58.484 - 00:10:02.156, Speaker A: There was a large leverage. Wipe out that. Yeah, a lot of leverage came off.
00:10:02.180 - 00:10:02.700, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:02.852 - 00:10:06.144, Speaker C: And so I think the trend is still intact.
00:10:06.684 - 00:10:10.396, Speaker B: And I'm looking at something like the 100 day moving average to kind of.
00:10:10.420 - 00:10:18.484, Speaker C: Confirm to me that we're still trending higher. And that's right around 57k. So you still have a ton of room.
00:10:18.644 - 00:10:22.804, Speaker A: And a lot of people have said, like, 58 is a reasonable, like that would also make sense.
00:10:22.884 - 00:10:23.316, Speaker C: Yeah, no.
00:10:23.340 - 00:10:24.948, Speaker A: To just look at the charts and stuff.
00:10:25.036 - 00:10:28.172, Speaker C: And I think, like, you know, sometimes.
00:10:28.228 - 00:10:36.510, Speaker B: It'S better to look at the big picture charts. Like look at the monthly candles and stuff and, you know, not get too caught up in the day to day noise.
00:10:36.582 - 00:10:52.806, Speaker A: And it is funny. Cause like, if you look at, like I said, if you look at 61 and you say, oh my gosh, we're down. Yeah, like you said, I mean, we were doing this pod in January 23, it was 16 six or something, I think in the first episode of the year last year. So like, I mean, you know. Yeah, it's just psychology, the way people think about it.
00:10:52.870 - 00:10:56.030, Speaker C: Tons of like ETF inflows, more people interested than ever.
00:10:56.102 - 00:11:32.284, Speaker A: And a lot of those platforms that we've been talking about being the main net new accessible market, like the wealth advisors and the financial advisor platforms, they're still not turned on. So. But, but it does seem like those flood just on the flows. We saw some incredible inflows, I think something like 14 or so billion in inflows, net inflows not including or, you know, net of the grayscale outflows, that was before any of those platforms turned on. So I guess we assume, I mean, not that they weren't all institutions, but they were people buying institutions too. But retail on like brokerage platforms, basically.
00:11:32.364 - 00:11:33.024, Speaker B: Yep.
00:11:33.564 - 00:11:56.252, Speaker A: Those have really sort of dried up over, I mean, it's been less every week for like the last four weeks. So has everyone now? This is an impossible question to ask, but it leads me to ask, has any everyone now that apparently did want to get it through their brokerage account and could and did like, is there's no more dry powder there. It seems like retail has aggro, has allocated.
00:11:56.308 - 00:11:58.644, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think historically, if you.
00:11:58.684 - 00:12:13.638, Speaker B: Look, you know, some of this flow activities related to tax season and stuff. And so, you know, typically, I do think you start to see an uptick in retail involvement in risk markets in terms of like equity inflows and stuff. So there's a case to be made.
00:12:13.686 - 00:12:16.702, Speaker C: That, yeah, the people that got access.
00:12:16.758 - 00:12:22.726, Speaker B: To it have allocated already, but there's still so many people that don't have access that so many platforms that haven't been turned on.
00:12:22.790 - 00:12:23.014, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:23.054 - 00:12:24.582, Speaker B: You know, vanguards of the world.
00:12:24.638 - 00:12:31.402, Speaker A: So I mean, sort of like wave one maybe has played out a little bit and like, wave two is yet to happen. Yeah, maybe.
00:12:31.498 - 00:12:33.810, Speaker B: At the end of the day, I mean, it's like you just have to.
00:12:33.842 - 00:12:35.306, Speaker C: Think about what your trade is when.
00:12:35.330 - 00:12:40.962, Speaker B: You'Re buying bitcoin and your trade is short dollars. Yeah, and I'm happily short dollars.
00:12:41.058 - 00:12:44.034, Speaker A: There you go. Bimnet Abibi, my friend from galaxy trading. Thanks for coming.
