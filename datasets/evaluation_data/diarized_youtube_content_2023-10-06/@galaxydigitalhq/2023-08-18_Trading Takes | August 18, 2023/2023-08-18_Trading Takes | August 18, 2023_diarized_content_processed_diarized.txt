00:00:07.320 - 00:00:11.446, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, great to see you.
00:00:11.510 - 00:00:12.518, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.606 - 00:00:16.926, Speaker A: So we're not in the office, actually, you're in the office. I'm not in the office. So that's why we look a little different here.
00:00:17.070 - 00:00:27.054, Speaker B: You know, I blame Alex for this. I'm an office guy seven days a week, you know, 24 hours a day. Yeah, exactly.
00:00:27.094 - 00:00:27.246, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:27.270 - 00:00:40.314, Speaker A: They never sleep. So you've been talking a lot the last couple of weeks and I know it's still relevant in your mind about the US treasury curve. Absolutely. So let's start there. Where does it stand now in your mind?
00:00:41.094 - 00:01:51.000, Speaker B: 30 year yields are testing the highs again today around 430 to 435. And we've seen tests of new year to date highs across all of fixed income here in the US. And so I still think that you're likely going to see the back end of the curve continue to steepen relative to the front end and that those nominal yields are going to have to rise. And a rise of, call it 25 to 50 basis points on either the ten year part of the curve or the 30 year part of the curve with the front end staying constantly still takes you to like neg 25 basis points ish of inversion. And so I think there's still tons of room for the backend to sell off. And fundamentally there's nothing in the supply demand picture that I think is gonna change to alter that view in any way. Long story short, the government is deficit spending like crazy and the central banks are no longer buying fixed income on their balance sheet.
00:01:51.000 - 00:02:30.322, Speaker B: And so all the supply has got to get absorbed and the buyer base to absorb this supply is shrinking by the day. And so I think path lease resistance is higher than us back end yields and that's going to weigh on risk sentiment and already has. You've seen the Nasdaq trade off significantly again today. We had a down 1% day yesterday and we're meaningfully off the highs at this point. So you're definitely seeing that spillover impact into traditional markets and equities. In FX dollar has been rallying. Dollar yen is in currency intervention territory.
00:02:30.322 - 00:02:57.870, Speaker B: It's almost trading at 146. The last time we were here, obviously the BOJ had to step in and that's largely, again a function of the US stuff, but also the BOJ policy, which is really not doing much in the way of. Of tightening monetary policy. And so I really think the setup's there for higher us rates, lower us equities, and probably a stronger dollar over the next handful of months.
00:02:57.942 - 00:03:12.806, Speaker A: So crypto in this landscape, and I feel like we're almost beating a dead horse because volatility has been so low. I think bitcoin realized volatility is essentially at the lowest ever. I ran it yesterday, on Tuesday.
00:03:12.870 - 00:03:13.646, Speaker B: Might as well be.
00:03:13.710 - 00:03:15.344, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:03:15.384 - 00:03:16.848, Speaker A: And it was the 37.
00:03:16.936 - 00:03:50.044, Speaker B: You're splitting hairs here. It's like, it's in one of those, like, low percentiles. It involves low. And I think that is justified because, you know, one, in theory, like, the more this asset class matures, you know, the lower volume profile it's going to have. Like, you don't want bitcoin trading at 100 volume. If you think it's going to be a store of value asset, you want it periodically rallying. But it shouldn't be an insane volume asset if you're trying to attract a trillion dollars of capital into that asset.
00:03:50.044 - 00:04:43.736, Speaker B: One, I wouldn't be like, oh, my God, there's no interest, there's no activity, because I would just say that it might actually help the long term narrative and the profile of the asset class. Two, outside of this, I think you've highlighted it, you know, on some of the pieces you've written. But, you know, this grayscale stuff, we were expecting the decision on Tuesday didn't happen. Might get it on Friday. But outside of that, I don't see much of a. I don't see many near term positive catalysts. And even if you were to get the ETF approval, it's like one of those things where you actually need that approval and that product actually be available to see the impact, the amount of impact you're gonna get from folks speculating on the approval.
00:04:43.736 - 00:05:35.574, Speaker B: There's a limit to that. And I think we've already hit that limit in terms of just like, in the conversation of ideas just saturating the thought process around the ETF, et cetera. And you've had retail buy tons of bitcoin, bitcoin related equities, all that. So people loaded up on the ETF narrative already. And so I think until you actually get to the event where institutions that are comfortable with the BlackRock ETF can actually buy it in the open market, and you can see that flow, it's gonna be tough for us to rally based on this ETF narrative. Outside of, if you get this grayscale win, I think you could get a nice little pop, but I'm kind of struggling to see what would justify prices being higher or volume being more elevated.
00:05:37.194 - 00:05:38.234, Speaker C: Yep. Yep.
00:05:38.274 - 00:06:06.274, Speaker A: I saw a headline on Bloomberg, it says bitcoin volatility vanishes amid, quote, extreme apathy and exhaustion. I was chuckling about this a little bit because, you know, bitcoin at just don't consider to be extreme apathy. Maybe I'm taking too long a view in bitcoin's life cycle, but it is, it is absent. I mean, we had that step up on the Blackrock ETF announcement, which was mid June, and we've basically just been sideways since then.
00:06:06.394 - 00:06:12.322, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think it's generally, it's also good that it's not going down aggressively.
00:06:12.418 - 00:06:12.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:12.650 - 00:07:09.118, Speaker B: We've had tons of macro assets come down, commodities come down in the past couple of weeks, et cetera. The fact that it's holding in okay with the broader market and even alts getting hosed, I think is a sign that folks that bought it on the ETF narrative, they're not. I mean, some of them were the leveraged crazy, really aggressive, like, hedge fund type buying we can type of buying, but a lot of it kind of seems to be like a very institutional esque sort of buyer base. Not necessarily institutions, but retail with a much longer investing horizon. And so I do think that you can see that in the price action, that folks aren't really panicking to sell this stuff, because they know that in, you know, whether it's six months from now or a year from now, you know, this product is gonna have that institutional moment and, you know.
00:07:09.166 - 00:07:49.608, Speaker A: Yeah, I think your point about flows makes a lot of sense as it relates to the ETF. You have the narrative right, which is a lot of speculation. But then in terms of this specific type of headline, if it comes to pass, it is one that creates a new avenue for flows to come into the industry. You get the narrative speculation around its approval and then its launch. But then bitcoin can start treating even more like a macro asset because it becomes available to so many more types of investors. And then you can see the structural flows occur and it becomes more of a flow story over a narrative story at that point.
00:07:49.736 - 00:08:24.584, Speaker B: Exactly. I think the flow story is really what matters. And the flows, if we're even on the most conservative end, like the amount of assets that bitcoin is going to attract via an ETF product, I think is underestimated by the market. I may be wrong there. I think folks have done the GLD comparison and folks have some bullish outcomes. But in theory, the way I think about it is, let's say an ETF launched today. I think bitcoin would be well through 40k, like easily.
00:08:24.624 - 00:08:28.464, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I mean, it reduces the risk.
00:08:28.624 - 00:08:36.992, Speaker B: Yeah. And so you don't see that kind of like flow impact in the market or that expected flow impact quite yet.
00:08:37.088 - 00:08:37.488, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:37.576 - 00:08:52.360, Speaker A: It reduces the risk for traditional wealth managers, Raas, other types of investors. They no longer have to consider it as the separate thing that needs bespoke custody and can't track the prices without going to weird crypto websites.
00:08:52.392 - 00:08:52.824, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:52.944 - 00:09:06.392, Speaker A: It sits right there next to all the other ETF options that they can offer their clients. It definitely at least becomes a bigger part of the conversation when it comes to portfolio allocation in the event that that ETF becomes live.
00:09:06.488 - 00:09:49.546, Speaker B: Yeah. And then just, I always have to say this every day the argument for bitcoin gets stronger from a monetary standpoint. I mean, just look at the shadow banking crisis in China for the time being. You've got, formerly their largest property developer, that their bonds are now frozen. The PBOC is now cutting interest rates again. Japan had gangbusters GDP, but they can't get off of negative interest rates in their front end, and they can't even get to 1% yet on their tenure note. And the Fed is telling you that they're likely pausing.
00:09:49.546 - 00:10:56.158, Speaker B: And I think the market is, there's going to be a limit to how much the yield curve can steepen. And I think there's going to be a call on the Fed at some point anyway, not getting there. But the monetary arguments between now and when the ETF launches, I think are going to only be stronger in the sense that either we'll have gone through some financial market havoc that will make us more inclined for easier monetary policy, or the data will have just slowed down by then where you can actually cut interest rates or foresee the Fed cutting, et cetera. But by and large, it seems like the hawkish tilt that you've had among central banks over the past, call it twelve to 18 months, you're on the last legs of that. And it goes to show you the limits of, of monetary policy and fiscal and. Right, like, it's just like every day, it's like, wait, the government wants to have a near record deficit even though we have an inflation problem. Like, just these such obvious things.
00:10:56.158 - 00:11:37.734, Speaker B: Wait, we're going to give ups, labor drivers a huge raise and the UK labor market that everybody's getting raised like crazy and people are like, how are you going to fight inflation when you're giving people like five, 6% raises? Like, wait, what is that going to lead to? More consumption, higher prices, and so the logical extensions of where monetary and fiscal policy can get to ultimately are always going to be pro bitcoin or hard assets. And I think over the next six months, you'll see a much stronger case play out.
00:11:38.114 - 00:11:39.162, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah.
00:11:39.178 - 00:11:49.114, Speaker A: There's a cognitive dissonance there between the inflation and the various policies. Look, let's wrap it there. We could go on and on. My friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, thank you so much for joining galaxy brains.
