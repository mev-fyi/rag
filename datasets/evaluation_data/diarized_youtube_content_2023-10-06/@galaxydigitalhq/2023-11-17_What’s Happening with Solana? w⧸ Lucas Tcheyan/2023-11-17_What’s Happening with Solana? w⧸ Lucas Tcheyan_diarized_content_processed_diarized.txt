Wow. We're back, Phineas. We're back in the studio. Last week we were at Pubkey, NYC, my favorite venue, with good friends of ours, Nick Carter and Matt Walsh from Castle Islands on the Brink. Podcast for a live show.
00:01:47.710 - 00:01:49.358, Speaker A: That was our first live show.
00:01:49.444 - 00:01:53.230, Speaker B: Yeah, Galaxy Brain's first live show. What'd you think?
00:01:53.300 - 00:02:11.462, Speaker A: I thought it was a lot of fun and it was well attended. I mean, I think people really enjoyed. Know you get Nick. Nick is a funny guy, and Nick and Matt together are a great combo. I was very proud to work with those guys and be up there with them because we've talked about this. I don't want to Belagor the point, but I love their podcast. I thought it was a really fun thing.
00:02:11.462 - 00:02:20.746, Speaker A: James Seifart from Bloomberg Intelligence joined us. Thomas Pacquiao, from Pubkey came up as well. And you can see that it's on our feeds. It's on our YouTube channel now.
00:02:20.848 - 00:02:36.090, Speaker B: Yeah, it felt like the community really coming out. The New York scene was there in numbers and people participated. Questions and yeah, Pubkey was a great host. What a fantastic venue.
00:02:36.170 - 00:02:43.342, Speaker A: Amazing venue, awesome food and drinks there. I mean, it was just a good time. I don't know, we got to think of our next.
00:02:43.476 - 00:02:44.402, Speaker B: You want to do it again?
00:02:44.456 - 00:02:46.494, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. First pub key. Next what? Yankee Stadium.
00:02:46.542 - 00:02:56.802, Speaker B: I mean, that's what saying, like, you felt good, you sort of know. And I was curious to how you would enjoy it and it seemed like it was a good time.
00:02:56.856 - 00:03:05.800, Speaker A: I thought it was a good time. Unfortunately for listeners who were not present, you don't get to hear the musical collaboration that Nick Carter and I did.
00:03:06.250 - 00:03:07.382, Speaker B: Live audiences only.
00:03:07.436 - 00:03:19.014, Speaker A: Live audiences only. So try to get out next time, whenever that is. I mean, it's not on the schedule, but I think we're going to do it. I don't know, I thought it was fun. It was a good time. Everyone check that out for now. Let's check this show out.
00:03:19.014 - 00:03:28.362, Speaker A: Let's get right into it. Bimnet. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BImnet, thanks for joining Galaxy Brains.
00:03:28.426 - 00:03:29.390, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:03:29.460 - 00:03:34.062, Speaker A: Saw CPI came in, the things are changing out here.
00:03:34.116 - 00:03:37.874, Speaker C: They are. We talked about a little paradigm shift happening in the day last week.
00:03:37.912 - 00:03:38.962, Speaker A: We talked about it, yeah.
00:03:39.096 - 00:04:10.378, Speaker C: And so what we saw from the CPI report was a decline in prices in a broad based way. The headline number came in flat, the core CPI number came in at 0.2. These are all indicative of what we like to call a soft landing. Some of the components in particular that drove some of the weakness or the softening was you had owners equivalent rent decline to like 0.4 month on month versus like 0.6. The services started to cool down a little bit. Airline fares came off.
00:04:10.378 - 00:04:18.586, Speaker C: Energy prices have been cooling, not in the CPI, but if you just look at gas prices over the past nine weeks, they're literally down nine weeks in a row.
00:04:18.618 - 00:04:20.382, Speaker A: Like crude, basically, yeah.
00:04:20.516 - 00:04:23.294, Speaker C: People pay for at the pump. Crude's been down.
00:04:23.332 - 00:04:25.502, Speaker A: Are they? I don't really drive a lot anymore.
00:04:25.646 - 00:04:27.970, Speaker C: I think the national average is probably low three.
00:04:28.040 - 00:04:30.610, Speaker A: Is there even a gas station in New York? In Manhattan.
00:04:32.550 - 00:04:38.530, Speaker C: But no, it's tough to get a sense, but high level, it seems like the prices, but that's important.
00:04:38.600 - 00:04:41.430, Speaker A: The gas price is a true metric for Americans. Absolutely.
00:04:41.500 - 00:04:42.486, Speaker C: People spend money on that.
00:04:42.508 - 00:04:44.038, Speaker A: It costs money. Yeah, absolutely.
00:04:44.124 - 00:04:46.562, Speaker C: And why we strip it out because it's volatile.
00:04:46.706 - 00:04:48.614, Speaker A: It's absurd, that whole thing.
00:04:48.732 - 00:05:17.154, Speaker C: Krugman is always saying that the inflation, it's like you always care about the rate of change, not the price level. It's messed up. And you have any idea how far behind the curve that those figures were when inflation was like 1314, 15% and they're telling you it was only eight. The figures are absurd and you need to adjust them for the 21st century. And we don't, because the Fed and all these people are just an academic institution that's been around doing the same.
00:05:17.192 - 00:05:18.594, Speaker A: Stuff, want to keep it the same.
00:05:18.712 - 00:05:52.686, Speaker C: Basically, for the past 40 years. And now that they missed catching the inflation story, they're more focused on like anecdotal evidence and high frequency points. But high level, it's still nonsense. And you can parse the data however you want. But I think the most important thing that the market should really think about is the last mile in terms of getting inflation under control is typically the toughest. That's what history tells us. And given the price reaction that we've had in markets since that CPI report, I think that's abundantly clear.
00:05:52.686 - 00:06:12.190, Speaker C: Just to give you an idea, yesterday was one of the largest loosening of financial conditions of the year. And I think going back a couple of years. But high level, I mean, just to give you a couple bits of information, the Russell was up almost five and a half percent yesterday.
00:06:12.270 - 00:06:12.946, Speaker A: Wow.
00:06:13.128 - 00:06:17.350, Speaker C: Like literally its best performance of the day of the year.
00:06:17.420 - 00:06:17.942, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:18.076 - 00:06:18.422, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:18.476 - 00:06:50.570, Speaker C: And Nasdaq's back to trend highs, almost SP 4500 and change. Bonds have rallied till tens are 450. There's inflows into high yield bond ETFs. And so what you're seeing is folks going really out the risk curve and buying junk, going out the risk curve in terms of duration and buying longer dated paper. And that's kind of what happens when the market gets a sense that the Fed's turning a bit or the data is turning a little bit. And what is that? That's inflationary, not deflationary.
00:06:50.650 - 00:06:52.880, Speaker A: I see. This is why the last mile is so hard.
00:06:53.570 - 00:06:55.138, Speaker C: It becomes such a push pull.
00:06:55.224 - 00:07:01.780, Speaker A: Yeah. You get the good news on inflation, which makes people go out on the risk curve, which can increase inflation. Correct.
00:07:02.630 - 00:07:16.390, Speaker C: Most directly, is like you had mortgage rates drop recently by to the tune of like 25, probably a little bit more now, 30, 35 basis points. And once you had those mortgage rates drop, what happened? Mortgage applications shot up.
00:07:16.540 - 00:07:16.854, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:16.892 - 00:07:22.346, Speaker C: Till the highest level since June. Right. So what's going to happen if mortgage rates fall? Oh, wait, people are going to be.
00:07:22.368 - 00:07:25.914, Speaker A: Like, oh, maybe housing market is going to tighten again. Everyone's going to jump, pile in.
00:07:26.032 - 00:07:26.458, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:26.544 - 00:08:21.642, Speaker C: And so it becomes such a pushball. And what we have to keep in mind is that one of the things that people don't even talk about, that's a huge thing is who's going to be doing layoffs in these large multinationals when their stock prices are close to the dead highs? You're going to feel the need to really let go of 10% of your workforce when your stock is within 5% of all time highs. It's so difficult to, and these people at the Fed, they're so concerned about breaking things like when tens were breaking the 5%. Everybody knows the fiscal situation is messed up, right? You got to let that stuff run. I think if you want to get back to someplace that's reasonable. But right now what it kind of seems like is risk. Markets are going to rip people long, risk assets and bonds are going to do well.
00:08:21.642 - 00:08:26.638, Speaker C: That's going to be inflationary. Nobody's going to get laid off. And three months from now we're going.
00:08:26.644 - 00:08:28.702, Speaker B: To be like, oh, inflation's back.
00:08:28.756 - 00:08:29.550, Speaker C: Inflation's back.
00:08:29.620 - 00:08:35.866, Speaker A: Yeah. This is the big fear. This is the Paul Volcker era fear. They did this. They did a whole cycle, I forget.
00:08:35.898 - 00:08:36.734, Speaker C: How high it got.
00:08:36.852 - 00:08:46.342, Speaker A: And then they come back, really kill inflation. Yeah. Which would be what? Raise it even further, keep raising six plus percent, not higher for longer. Higher for longer and even higher from here for longer, correct.
00:08:46.476 - 00:08:46.726, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:46.748 - 00:08:51.320, Speaker A: And I know Jay Powell is very concerned about that, but apparently not enough.
00:08:52.170 - 00:08:58.098, Speaker C: No, not concerned enough buying it. There are 100 basis points of cuts.
00:08:58.114 - 00:09:22.590, Speaker A: Yeah. I was looking after the CPI came out yesterday, the cuts literally the day before it was 25 bips of cuts by May, but still even some increase priced in before then. And now it's just flat and down. Cuts, cuts in March, again, according to this is with them, how the market is pricing it. I think 28 bips of cuts when I looked this morning in March is what the market is expecting.
00:09:23.090 - 00:09:32.642, Speaker C: It's absurd, but you have to price in some kind of premium or discount because they'll go 50 or 100 when they go.
00:09:32.696 - 00:09:33.058, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:33.144 - 00:09:34.338, Speaker C: And the risks are.
00:09:34.424 - 00:09:51.210, Speaker A: But it is a disconnect between, I guess higher for longer doesn't mean no cuts, it just means that we might stay overall higher than usual for longer. But it is a disconnect between the market and the Fed's language. Right. The market is basically calling the Fed's bluff, they think.
00:09:51.360 - 00:10:23.346, Speaker C: I agree. So here's why that friction exists is one for the effective implementation of monetary policy. The Fed needs less cuts baked into the market because they need money to flow out from the very front end into the rest of the curve. Because we're issuing so much debt and paper that they need people to buy it. People won't buy that stuff if it has a lot of cuts baked in. They'll just keep the money in the front stuff. And so for the smooth implementation of monetary policy, they actually need less cuts priced in.
00:10:23.346 - 00:10:57.562, Speaker C: In addition, if you're the Fed, you need to preserve optionality. You need to preserve the option of hiking. Again, you don't want to shock the market with a hike. And so that's why they're constantly on the more hawkish side, it feels like. But the other thing you're pointing out as well is where is neutral inflation now? More and more it seems like the inflation expectations and realized inflation is kind of hovering around this 3% area, the low threes, instead of this 2% target.
00:10:57.626 - 00:10:57.998, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:58.084 - 00:11:30.166, Speaker C: And so there may be a rebasing of just general level of inflation happening across the economy in terms of a quote, unquote new normal. Right. And that's what you're seeing in some of the inflation expectation data as well, like the Umish, which is really volatile. And you got to caveat it a lot. But anyway, those one year inflation expectations are on a 4%. And people that have gotten used to just higher and higher prices, they get accustomed to it and they're like, oh, it's time for a raise at your end as well. And it becomes entrenched.
00:11:30.166 - 00:11:49.870, Speaker C: And so the fear is that inflation might be entrenched around 3% now, which means that interest rates are still too low in that context. And so I see all the soft pieces of the data turning in the economy. There's like a freight crisis.
00:11:51.170 - 00:11:59.426, Speaker A: I saw freight and truck, truck driver, someone has a chart of the truck driver layoffs. And like the only times it has gone negative, it's been in a recession 100% of the time or something.
00:11:59.528 - 00:12:27.530, Speaker C: Yeah. And then also just anyone in the lower income quartiles, they are getting eaten away at by just the high yields, right. And they just don't have enough disposable income to survive in this kind of environment. And then you get trapped in a debt cycle and you're seeing non performing loans tick up and default rates of lower credit score people tick up and stuff. And so that's where the pain is in the economy.
00:12:28.270 - 00:12:49.534, Speaker A: And these are folks that don't have investable money. Right. So they're not able to hedge by owning assets, even by buying the yielding debt. Right. So they're just seeing it at the pump, at the supermarket, at the retail stores, when they travel for holidays, they're bearing the brunt. Right. This is why we often say that inflation is like a tax on the poor, primarily.
00:12:49.534 - 00:12:53.714, Speaker A: Right, exactly. Wealthy people can pay 5% more for their food.
00:12:53.912 - 00:13:00.930, Speaker C: Wealthy people are earning 5% on their checking account, and their 401 ks are back to close to trend highs.
00:13:01.010 - 00:13:01.446, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:01.548 - 00:13:01.958, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:02.044 - 00:13:06.018, Speaker A: Bimnetta BB from Galaxy trading. My friend, thank you so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:13:06.114 - 00:13:06.870, Speaker C: Pleasure.
00:13:08.810 - 00:13:13.462, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Lucas Chan from Galaxy Research. Lucas, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:13:13.526 - 00:13:14.410, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:13:14.480 - 00:13:37.258, Speaker A: Let's talk about Solana. It's an iconic and technologically differentiated blockchain, which is one of the reasons I've always been interested in it. Unlike bitcoin and ETH, it is not an ether. It's not pursuing a scaling by layers, methodology, or modularity sort of design. It is sort of the iconic, monolithic blockchain.
00:13:37.354 - 00:13:38.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:39.670 - 00:13:49.646, Speaker A: So it's one reason I've always been interested in it. But also, you were just at breakpoint, their big annual conference. What was it like? What were your impressions?
00:13:49.758 - 00:14:36.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so breakpoint is the annual Solana conference that's held once a year. Was in Amsterdam this year. I personally was very impressed. I think we're in an environment where people are starting to get a little bit more interested in crypto more generally. And you could really feel that there was an energy there, not just from existing people working in Seoul, but people outside the ecosystem who were starting to notice that maybe there's some real activity going on here. I think for me, the three major components I look for in any chain to see if it can continue to grow and build products that people want, are what is the developer community like, what is the social layer like? And then what's the technology like? And I think for Solana, you've got a very differentiated tech know. It's a monolithic, or people are calling it integrated chain right now.
00:14:36.920 - 00:15:08.014, Speaker B: It's got a very different narrative from something like Ethereum and bitcoin, because they're specifically saying, listen, we're focused on execution and scalability. Above all, bitcoin is a store of value. Ethereum could be a high value settlement layer. We're going to be where people build products and where those products can be cheap enough and fast enough that a lot of consumers want to use it. So I think collectively, Solana's got that differentiated tech. It's got a very devoted and committed developer community. That was very evident while I was there.
00:15:08.014 - 00:15:37.622, Speaker B: And what you hear talking to a lot of these teams, which I think is important, is, for them, this is really just the beginning. They feel like in the wake of everything that's happened over the past two years, that Solana has really been underappreciated for the developments that have happened on chain and the type of products that teams are building. And they're angry and they're hungry, and they want to prove people not just that Solana is a good chain, but that Solana is a chain where only certain products can be built, and they need to be built on that.
00:15:37.676 - 00:16:01.470, Speaker A: Interesting. So hasn't Solana had major technology problems? I mean, I remember seeing, it seemed at some points, it was like every week there was an outage when the whole blockchain basically went down. Is that still true? I don't follow it. So, I mean, that was a problem. Is it still a problem?
00:16:01.620 - 00:16:23.218, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's definitely been massive improvements. So over the know, we're coming up on now three quarters where Solana had no performance degradation, no downtime issues. And that's, I think, a huge milestone for the Solana ecosystem. And what's interesting to me is it's not just that there's not a lot of activity. So the network is having problem. They have implemented tangible updates that are improving.
00:16:23.314 - 00:16:24.230, Speaker A: What do they do?
00:16:24.380 - 00:16:46.718, Speaker B: Stake weighted Qos. So, basically, depending on the amount of stake that you have, it increases your chance of being able to include a block that helps deal with spam issues quick. It's another way of basically throttling all these bots that are spamming validators, that they don't get overloaded and they don't shut down. You have local fee. This, this is really dealing with hotspot issues because that was one of the.
00:16:46.724 - 00:17:13.666, Speaker A: Things, is there was no fee market at all. And so I remember looking at Solana's overloaded spam issues being like, gosh, if only someone had come up with a way to defend against civil attack. Oh, wow. It's fees. That's always been fees, right? Like, always has been. It's how bitcoin and ethereum, that's how they all prevent spam, basically, right? They raise the cost of transacting, but it had no fee markets at all. So they added fee markets.
00:17:13.666 - 00:17:13.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:13.868 - 00:18:03.586, Speaker B: So they added localized fee markets, which is saying that on Solana, when a transaction happens, it points to exactly which state that it touches. And so as a result, they're able to parallelize their transactions. So instead of like Ethereum, where you only have one thread of transactions coming through on Solana, you have kind of four threads right now. And so say that you are trying to buy an NFT and there's thousands of other people trying to buy that NFT, and then there's another person who's just trying to swap some tokens, and there's nobody else trying to swap those tokens. The people who are all trying to buy the NFT, they might see their fees spike because they're all trying to touch the same state. But the people who are trying to swap the tokens, they're not going to see any fee spike. So it really makes like, discrete fee markets that prevents a hotspot in one area of the network affecting the whole network.
00:18:03.618 - 00:18:11.350, Speaker A: Like, I'm thinking of the. Was the board apes token that they launched, was it ape? Yeah. When they did the mint for ape on ETH?
00:18:11.430 - 00:18:11.818, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:18:11.904 - 00:18:15.178, Speaker A: Just like destroyed the entire chain, basically, for that day.
00:18:15.264 - 00:18:27.306, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And we saw actually earlier this year in May or so, there was a huge NFT mint going on at the same time that a major deep in protocol was bridging over or basically transplanting their whole protocol onto Solana.
00:18:27.338 - 00:18:28.494, Speaker A: So they had a lot of activity, too.
00:18:28.532 - 00:18:30.638, Speaker B: A lot of activity was totally fine.
00:18:30.724 - 00:18:34.646, Speaker A: So these are just two separate threads occurring at the same time with different fee markets.
00:18:34.698 - 00:19:09.590, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And right now it's four. And over time, as hardware improves, it could be a lot more, I think Salana TPS, that's like kind of one of the big value propositions. Say it's 400 transactions per second. This past weekend, we started to see some considerable increase in on chain activity. And what I was particularly impressed with is not only that the network was performing just fine, but we also saw TPS begin to move up. So it was at 400, it slowly started to creep up in the 500, 600 range, and then we were at some point seeing 600 to 700 plus in TPS.
00:19:09.590 - 00:19:21.470, Speaker B: And it really just shows that the network can handle more over time, it's going to continue to be able to handle more. And this is really just the beginning. So the technology updates have really, it seems, had an effect and are starting to work.
00:19:21.540 - 00:20:07.710, Speaker A: So it's exciting. I think it's quite interesting. It's just a totally different technology in the scheme of things. I think the way you describe bitcoin as a store of value, I would more say is maybe call it, like, mostly a monetary network, Ethereum, as you said, high value settlement layer, which I think is. Right. I mean, if you look at the majority of Defi and NFTs, all the biggest pools, the most valuable projects, they're all in. And to me, when I think of Solana, one of the issues that I remember was originally the idea, or I don't know who promulgated this idea, maybe you can tell us, but that it was going to be like central limited order books on chain.
00:20:08.050 - 00:20:10.074, Speaker B: It was being built on the blockchain.
00:20:10.122 - 00:20:12.622, Speaker A: Yeah. Where did that come from? Was that what Anatoly said?
00:20:12.676 - 00:20:20.686, Speaker B: Yeah, that was kind of Anatoli's original vision, because he has this story about how he was trading using normal traditional finance.
00:20:20.718 - 00:20:52.970, Speaker A: But that can't happen with downtime. This is one of the main issues. Right? Like, if you had money in a defi, let's say you had a loan, right? You're going to need to top up the loan, perhaps, because let's say the market moves against you and you got to put more collateral, but if the network goes down, you can't. Right. And you end up literally getting rugged. And so that was a major reason I feel, that there was almost no assets in DeFi in Solana for a long time. Is it still like that because there's genuine risk there?
00:20:53.120 - 00:20:53.494, Speaker B: Literally?
00:20:53.542 - 00:21:05.354, Speaker A: Any. When do we think outages happen? Well, they typically happen during big market moves, right? That's when it has to work. And it hadn't during sometimes. And I feel like that's a huge impediment for financial use cases on Solana.
00:21:05.402 - 00:21:37.050, Speaker B: Definitely. I mean, even myself, as a huge Solana user, I don't want to feel at any moment that I might not be able to access my assets and use the chain. And so I think, as we've seen from this past weekend, was a great test. We saw volumes on Solana pick up immensely. Solana Dex volumes this month are about to breach all time highs, and we're less than halfway through the month. So that was a great test of the network, and there was really no degradation issues. And as I said, TPS actually increased over the next probably year or so.
00:21:37.050 - 00:21:43.334, Speaker B: Timeline's not exact, but we're also going to see a new client, a validator client, come out called fire dancer.
00:21:43.462 - 00:21:45.050, Speaker A: So this is jump cryptos.
00:21:45.130 - 00:21:45.518, Speaker B: Yes.
00:21:45.604 - 00:21:52.494, Speaker A: Technology. Right. So there'll now be two clients. Two clients, one from the Salana foundation or whatever.
00:21:52.692 - 00:22:04.498, Speaker B: There's two clients currently. Another one's by Jito Labs. And that's basically like an MEV client, and it's like 99% the same as Salana Labs. So I don't really consider it to be like a differentiated client, but technically there are two.
00:22:04.584 - 00:22:10.142, Speaker A: So what is the fire dancer? Why is that more interesting than because basically fired?
00:22:10.206 - 00:22:53.938, Speaker B: I mean, the way that it's explained by tollian fire dancer team is basically, it's like they can now go back to all of the quick design decisions that Tolle had to make when he was first making the Solana Labs client and optimize everything. So it's really increasing. They're optimizing all the software of the current Solana Labs client. They're doing it with a completely different code base, so it definitely increases client diversity. And as a result, they're showing that they can get much better performance from even lower grade hardware. So it has the potential to not only increase the performance of the network, but also bring down costs for being a validator on the network, which continues to be a major criticism of the network because it is more expensive than.
00:22:54.024 - 00:22:56.674, Speaker A: The hardware intensive validator requirements.
00:22:56.722 - 00:22:57.560, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:22:59.450 - 00:23:07.766, Speaker A: Weren't there also a lot of big NFT projects exiting Solana? Which were those? I'm forgetting that d gods is the main one, right?
00:23:07.788 - 00:23:49.154, Speaker B: D gods was the main one. It's funny, I mean, I honestly feel bad for them because literally their founder tweeted out like, we're leaving Solana, and people, be careful, Solana's down, not, we're leaving Solana. And that day almost marked the bottom for the last spring or something. You know, they moved over to Ethereum and Polygon and listen, they made that decision. I think part of it worked out for them. NFTs are highly volatile, so it's just difficult to manage those type of things. But I think actually what we're seeing right now is that the NFT ecosystem in Solana is showing a huge rebound and huge resilience.
00:23:49.154 - 00:24:08.202, Speaker B: I think it's number three in terms of volume on crypto slam I saw today. I think if you look at kind of the top collections, it's no longer just like scammy collections that have been minted in the past month. I think when you used to look at Solana NFTs, the top collections were usually things that had been minted within a past.
00:24:08.336 - 00:24:09.610, Speaker A: There was no staying power.
00:24:09.680 - 00:24:31.182, Speaker B: Exactly. Now these are collections. I think all the collections were minted five months or earlier. All the top ones right now. And also some of them are social brand plays, but some of them are actually like product utility. They're related to marketplaces, they're related to centralized exchanges. So it's also a different type of NFT.
00:24:31.246 - 00:24:31.810, Speaker A: That's interesting.
00:24:31.880 - 00:24:40.618, Speaker B: And then finally you also have this kind of innovation happening with these things called compressed NFTs, which know they've brought down the cost of what is nfts?
00:24:40.654 - 00:24:41.190, Speaker A: What is that?
00:24:41.260 - 00:24:50.646, Speaker B: Basically they figured out a way to. They basically put like a Merkel tree on chain that contains thousands to hundreds of. So what is it?
00:24:50.668 - 00:24:52.278, Speaker A: You can deploy like a ton at once.
00:24:52.364 - 00:25:06.942, Speaker B: You can deploy, yeah, I forget the exact cost off the top of my head, but it's something crazy. Like you can employ like in a million NFTs for like $1,000 or less. That number might not be exact. Right. It could be a little less, a little more, but it's a pretty crazy.
00:25:07.076 - 00:25:19.042, Speaker A: Do you think we're going to have millions of NFTs in this world that matter, by the way? I asked that quite skeptically. However, some people would say, like, depending on what types of NFT use case we're talking about, it could be. Absolutely, yes.
00:25:19.176 - 00:25:51.994, Speaker B: I think there are some really interesting use cases for it. I think one place we've already seen it work is for deepen protocols that want to make NFTs of hotspots. What is DPIn decentralized physical infrastructure that works. So something like helium or a render where they have a ton of different people for helium specifically, they have a ton of different people that have these individual wireless hotspots. And they were able to make NFTs of each and every one of those using compressed think. Oh, yeah, sorry.
00:25:52.032 - 00:26:16.942, Speaker A: I was just going to say, okay, yes, helium. I'm recalling this project. I went on Salkadir's podcast, unlayered. They were talking about this and I was very critical of this concept, as you should be. I think what I was saying. So this is what, like an alternative Internet connectivity, right? Yeah. We can bring phone plans to people that can't get them more cheaply.
00:26:16.942 - 00:26:33.820, Speaker A: But I was like, doesn't literally everyone on earth have a cell phone? Isn't one of the most ubiquitous technologies? You could literally buy a SIM card in the airport in Nairobi and walk into the desert and the cell phone will work. Who needs this is what I'm saying.
00:26:34.510 - 00:26:43.802, Speaker B: It's not clear yet, but I mean, that said, like, a $5 mobile plan is pretty cheap. So they're offering $5 mobile plans, I think, in Miami right now. It's pretty cheap. And I also just.
00:26:43.856 - 00:26:46.970, Speaker A: That is cheap, to be clear. I use a major carrier and much more expensive.
00:26:47.050 - 00:27:15.734, Speaker B: It's cheap. What I think is interesting about that mechanism is what they're doing is they're saying, all right, we're going to use the helium network to power your mobile phone, but every once in a while we might not have coverage. So I think they fall back on T mobile network. But what they then do is they can track that. And whenever they fall back on T Mobile, they can then incentivize people. Like they'll increase the amount of rewards you get for hosting a hotspot in that area where the T mobile network had to be used.
00:27:15.772 - 00:27:16.322, Speaker A: Like Uber.
00:27:16.386 - 00:27:35.002, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's a great way of actually building this network out over time because I agree. Right. Like, do I want to have a helium network in the United States powering my phone? No, I want something that's going to cover me every there. But over time they can incentivize people to truly build out this network. I think it'd be effective.
00:27:35.146 - 00:27:43.230, Speaker A: So I interrupted you. You're talking about compressed NFTs. Okay. Your helium hotspot thing might have a use case for this. Were there others that you wanted to mention?
00:27:43.380 - 00:28:27.326, Speaker B: I think the other interesting one is just thinking about NFTs as being things of abundance instead of very limited supply. And I think there's room for one use case. That really stands out to me is if you're like a YouTube streamer and you're a gaming streamer, every day you play a game and you want to reward people who aren't just watching your YouTube but are watching the live stream, maybe you start rolling out compressed NFTs. Previously you'd have to pay thousands of dollars to do that. It's just not worth it. Now you're paying $10 to drop, what, 100,000 NFTs to people? And it's very marginal cost to you and it's a great way to just drive user engagement. So I do see use cases there.
00:28:27.326 - 00:28:43.166, Speaker B: Obviously. A lot of people like to say NFTs should be really valuable. I think this is showing. Well, maybe there's a use case where NFTs are just very cheap collectibles that people get for being loyal followers and things like this. And if you have a way to cheaply distribute it, I mean, it suddenly becomes viable.
00:28:43.198 - 00:29:06.442, Speaker A: Interesting. What about when I think of some of the stuff that's been happening on Solana? So we talked a little bit about DeFi and there's some struggles there, but I guess you're saying volumes are starting to pick up. Are we going to get the clob, the centralized, like, is the whole sort of vision changed? No, still a thing. The Nasdaq on chain or whatever you were saying.
00:29:06.496 - 00:29:32.402, Speaker B: Yes, that is happening in real time right now. There's a number of clubs already active on Salana. I think there's actually some great research coming out right now about capital, efficiency and showing how. I think one example was like, I think 70 million of the e USDC pair was traded last weekend on Ethereum. And to do that, there needed to be like 40 million in TVL, or there didn't need to, but there was.
00:29:32.456 - 00:29:33.186, Speaker A: On Salana, you mean?
00:29:33.208 - 00:29:58.458, Speaker B: No, on Ethereum. Okay, yeah, on Salana, there is like 40 million traded in USDC Sol, and the TvL was 1 million. So you just have a much more efficient market faster, and you just don't need as much TVL to facilitate that much because you can have clobs and stuff. You don't purely need to rely on LPs in AMfs. So I think there is definitely a narrative driving that. I think we're going to continue to see a lot of growth in that area down the road.
00:29:58.464 - 00:30:26.798, Speaker A: All right, here's another question. And this was really making me angry. Gosh, I guess in 2021, when Solana was first on the scene and getting big, there was no data. Right. The nodes are mega expensive. It's producing an enormous amount of data per day. I forget at one point someone told me every day it produces like 100GB or something insane, right? So there was none of the crypto data providers had anything on Salana.
00:30:26.798 - 00:30:50.590, Speaker A: There was soul scan, which is the sort of main ether scan or block explorer. It had some data, obviously, but I couldn't even get numbers on transactions over time. Nobody had anything, partly because of the design decisions that are powering the scalability choices. Is that still the, like, can we get data on Solana now?
00:30:50.660 - 00:31:21.350, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a very robust data ecosystem. You've got teams like Salana Beach, Salana FM, Soul scan, flipside, Artemis. And I think because they're starting to see real demand from users for that type of insight. So that whole area is building out. I actually, at breakpoint, there was a great presentation by the Solana FM team. They're like a block explorer of kind of the integrations they've done with artificial intelligence to basically chat GPT, their block explorer. And it's crazy.
00:31:21.350 - 00:31:28.434, Speaker B: You can just type in whatever you want and it'll pull whatever you need. So I think we're seeing a lot more transparency because it is an enormous.
00:31:28.482 - 00:31:31.350, Speaker A: Amount of data to parse and index and serve up metrics.
00:31:31.690 - 00:31:43.774, Speaker B: And I think most of it is hosted on Google Bigtable right now. So I think that is probably something that over the next year or two, is going to continue to be an area of focus in terms of how do we deal with all this?
00:31:43.812 - 00:32:16.902, Speaker A: Yeah, because one of my biggest angles at looking at crypto is show me data, show me adoption. Right? Like, I don't care if no one's using something, but I become interested as it becomes used. And it was like, I'm hearing that it's being used and I can't show it, I can't prove it. That's an important feature of blockchains, that they're open and transparent. And it's like, if it's transparent, but the thing is like a 900 pound gorilla you can't wrap your hands around, then it doesn't really matter if the data is there.
00:32:17.036 - 00:32:54.258, Speaker B: And I totally agree. And I do think one thing is interesting is that I think over the past two years, obviously, on chain activity has been way down. And so a lot of the improvements that we've been talking about have just gone under the radar because nobody's using the chain. But if you are using the chain, you could see those updates and those developments happening in real think. You know, one of the things I said coming out of breakpoint is the big challenge for Solana going forward is they need to get more on chain liquidity. And at the time, I had talked about maybe a few things that might improve on chain liquidity. So there is a huge Defi airdrop season that's going to be start rolling out in the next few weeks and will probably last six months or so.
00:32:54.264 - 00:32:55.470, Speaker A: What is this new protocols?
00:32:55.550 - 00:33:08.726, Speaker B: This is new protocols and some older protocols that have been running basically liquidity mining programs. And their view is, listen, we have ETH, they have all these tokens. It gave all these people liquidity to do stuff on chain. We need to simulate a sibling, which.
00:33:08.748 - 00:33:14.086, Speaker A: Is basically what basically everyone has done on Ethereum and all the l two s, they all run these types of programs.
00:33:14.118 - 00:33:42.194, Speaker B: And on Salana, we haven't really seen that happen yet. That's a huge event. I think that might increase on chain liquidity. I think there's two exchanges that are launching centralized exchanges that have actually very interesting integrations with blockchain, and they're focused on bringing liquidity to Salana. And then I think there's just a lot of people that are starting to see, obviously, there's this reflexivity in crypto. Everyone's starting to see things pick up. On Salana, there was like 3.5
00:33:42.194 - 00:34:20.846, Speaker B: million bridged over to Salana over the past week. We're normally seeing probably like a few hundred thousand a week. So activity is starting to pick up and as a result, people are starting to go on chain on Solana, and they're starting to say, wow, this is kind of like a buttery smooth experience. This is the UX that I want as a crypto user. And for me, it's very exciting to see people like, you saw Kathy woods go on CNBC yesterday and talk about how she thinks Solana is faster and better. That's very high level. But then you see someone like the blockworks guy tweet out yesterday, hey, I just used Jupyter, which is Solana's leading aggregator for the first time.
00:34:20.846 - 00:34:40.502, Speaker B: It's the best experience I've ever had in crypto. You see Jeremy Alair, the CEO of Circle yesterday Go, hey, I just used Jupiter for the first time. It's the best experience I've ever used in crypto. So it's really about kind of getting on chain liquidity so that people start using Solana and see that it does have a great ux, that it is as fast as people say, that it is as cheap as people say.
00:34:40.556 - 00:35:04.974, Speaker A: Interesting. Let's step back a little bit. And we talked about, I think we mentioned that. I think at this point now, Solana is sort of, I think many view it. I think I view it as potentially like the third. You have. So you have bitcoin and ether and Ethereum and its ecosystem, I'll say, which is this growing amalgamation of L2s primarily, right.
00:35:04.974 - 00:35:30.006, Speaker A: Mostly optimistic and zk rollups. And then you have Solana, which explicitly issues the layered scaling approach. I think one of the arguments I've heard, which actually makes a lot of sense to me, is like, well, if you have multiple L2s, aren't you fragmenting liquidity? And you're like, oh, I can bridge from here to there. And it's like, well, but then you have to bridge capital likes capital, and.
00:35:30.028 - 00:35:31.334, Speaker B: Bridges get hacked all the time.
00:35:31.372 - 00:35:59.354, Speaker A: That's true. Bridges have been one of the most dangerous applications in crypto, which makes sense because oftentimes they're trying to connect to unlike systems. Right. Okay. So in that world, I think it's quite notable that the Salana community continues to grow and that people are devoted. You really can't say that about other l ones. I mean, most are notably declining.
00:35:59.354 - 00:36:26.242, Speaker A: I mean, actively declining. Right. Whereas it does appear that the community in Solana is growing. And of course, there's growing interest, do you think that Solana, is it competing against Ethereum? Is it competing against Ethereum and all the l two s? Because Ethereum is very clearly focused on this layered, scaling approach, this modular approach. In fact, modularity could be even more fragmented.
00:36:26.306 - 00:36:51.466, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. I think, in my view, Salana is competing mostly with the l two s when it comes to Ethereum, and then they're competing with other Alt L1s. Everyone knows them all out there, and there's actually a few launching next year that I think integrate a lot of the design approaches that Salana takes, but do it with an EVM. So I think those are Salana's main competitors.
00:36:51.578 - 00:36:54.558, Speaker A: So alt l ones other than ETH and then ETH l two s and.
00:36:54.564 - 00:37:17.510, Speaker B: Then ethel two s. And I think you had Trey Aslani and on here. I think he made a great point, which is like, listen, Slana is more performant than Ethel two s right now. It's a better experience. So the big risk for Salana is that they don't have this stellar product before ETH l two s get to that status. And so I actually tweeted this the other day. I think the benchmark for Salana, this chain.
00:37:17.510 - 00:37:23.306, Speaker B: Sorry. This cycle, is very simple. It's product. They just need products.
00:37:23.408 - 00:37:24.474, Speaker A: Things people want to use.
00:37:24.512 - 00:37:26.694, Speaker B: Exactly. They don't need to have a currency.
00:37:26.742 - 00:37:28.794, Speaker A: They don't need to go from 600 tps to 1000.
00:37:28.832 - 00:37:34.814, Speaker B: Yes. They just need, like, one or two products where people are like, wow, this is something that I would.
00:37:34.852 - 00:38:06.822, Speaker A: Can I tell you one that I've heard of in the Solana ecosystem that I'm actually quite excited for. And it's something I've wanted for probably about seven years, is Uber on the blockchain. And there's a guy, Paul Bohm, who I've actually known for quite a while, who has a startup called Teleport, which is a Solana based ride sharing app. Right. That is something I would use. First of all, I mean, Uber and Lyft, like, ride sharing apps are an incredible product experience. Right? It's never.
00:38:06.822 - 00:38:14.540, Speaker A: Do you remember, I don't know. You're younger than me, but you used to have to call a cap. I was in Boston, the operator would be like, yeah, 45 minutes. You're like, what?
00:38:14.990 - 00:38:15.354, Speaker B: Now?
00:38:15.392 - 00:38:48.526, Speaker A: It's just like. I mean, I remember when Travis, what's his name, kalanik, he used to say, like, push a button, get a ride. Like that, get a car. And it is that simple. But to me, those companies have a huge take rate I talk to the drivers all the time. I don't know where it stands at all time, but they're taking 30 plus percent of the fees, and you're like, what service does Uber really offer the company? In my mind, it's two things. It's the software that we use to connect drivers and riders, and it's effectively the background checks on the drivers.
00:38:48.526 - 00:39:08.794, Speaker A: But I was always thinking, like, well, the software should not be an issue. This is really not that complicated stuff. Right. Peer to peer, I think that could be done. The background checks. Couldn't you have a much smaller fee and have, say, a foundation whose sole purpose it is to conduct background checks? Yeah, it seems possible to me. I'm not even saying that.
00:39:08.794 - 00:39:33.234, Speaker A: Some people have said you don't even need the background check. You could literally just rely on reputation. Obviously, the cold start problem is a problem there, because if I want to start driving for the first time, I have zero reputation. That first time driver could be any kind of murderer or whomever, and that's bad. But couldn't we obfuscate most of that? Have you looked at teleport? Is this what they're doing?
00:39:33.352 - 00:39:43.446, Speaker B: Yeah, this is exactly what they're. I haven't looked too closely yet. I did watch their presentation at breakpoint, and it's exactly what you've laid out. And they've been working on it for a long time because there are also.
00:39:43.468 - 00:40:03.120, Speaker A: A lot of decentralized Ubers. I remember, not in this way, but I remember there were some cities that had banned Uber, and so people would just like, there were Facebook groups where you could just be like, need a ride here? And somebody would come get you. That emerged in a lot of places where these apps were banned. So it's definitely possible.
00:40:04.290 - 00:40:26.382, Speaker B: I think it's totally possible. And I think actually an interesting thing about that is it's complementary to other things that are being built on Solana. So you could integrate all these really fast payment networks that are being spun up on Solana to actually facilitate. Maybe you don't need to use Solana blockchain. There's a product called Hive Mapper that is basically trying to create a GPS. You can be a driver using telephone.
00:40:26.446 - 00:40:27.458, Speaker A: And they got the phone.
00:40:27.544 - 00:40:28.340, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:40:29.030 - 00:40:32.610, Speaker A: What's the latest on this phone, this Solana phone? What's it, the saga?
00:40:32.690 - 00:41:12.610, Speaker B: The saga? I think the benchmark for the saga is not so much like mass adoption right now. It's more like proof of concept. Let's just kind of incept this idea. What the real part of it is the SMS, the Solana mobile stack aspect of it, which is basically like an open source developer kit that you can build apps to use on things like Android. So I think the phone is kind of trying to induce demand for developers to build more mobile native applications. And I think we're starting to see traction toward that. During Solana's annual hackathon called Hyperdrive this year, one of the categories, they had a specific mobile category, just that hackathon in general, it had the most participants of any hackathon for Solana ever.
00:41:12.610 - 00:41:45.710, Speaker B: So another sign that you're seeing increased developer engagement, you're seeing more developer mind share. And it's not just going to building out infrastructure, it's going to building out AI products to gaming products, deepin payments mobile. It's all over the board. And that's what I want to see as someone who is interested in seeing Solana grow as a network is. I want to see just a large amount of products coming out at all times so that users who are on the network can constantly be trying iterating, giving feedback, and eventually really do find that product market fit.
00:41:45.780 - 00:42:22.542, Speaker A: I like that a lot of what you talk about and see out there in the Solana ecosystem is not purely financial in use. Case that is interesting. That's also pretty unique, I would say. I think so in the world of blockchains. Right, Lucas, before we wrap, you were on the podcast when I had the whole team come on a couple of months ago. But can you tell us your background, how you got interested in bitcoin and crypto? And I guess Solana, too, but tell our audience who you are and give your origin story in crypto.
00:42:22.626 - 00:42:38.266, Speaker B: Sure. So it's just a weird story. As with everyone, I started out working in finance in New York, out of college, did like an analyst program for two years. Great experience. Loved it. But I had grown up internationally. I spoke Chinese.
00:42:38.266 - 00:42:40.218, Speaker B: I've been taking Chinese since I was in 9th grade.
00:42:40.314 - 00:42:41.614, Speaker A: Still do, but used to, too.
00:42:41.652 - 00:43:13.274, Speaker B: Yes, I spoke it much better then. I still speak it all right now. And after two years working in finance, I knew I wanted to be abroad, so I moved to China. I lived in Beijing for five years, and I worked at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace as a US China foreign policy analyst. So I basically moved there right before Trump got elected, and then for five years watched the relationship just kind of crater and go off a cliff. But it was an incredible time to be there. It was really interesting being at the kind of the center of all of that.
00:43:13.274 - 00:43:54.422, Speaker B: And obviously, we're continuing to see those dynamics play out today after five years, kind of knew that I really wanted to be more on the business side of things, not so much on the policy side of things. But I do love the research aspect because I think what's really underappreciated in most lines of works is, like, getting below the surface level, and that's where you really get an edge. That's where you really find new, exciting, innovative ideas. And so at the time, I wasn't like a crypto native crypto oG. I just kind of was like, held a little bit of crypto and started going up in value, and I was like, you know, like, COVID's happening. I actually flew back from China the day that Wuhan shut down by.
00:43:54.556 - 00:43:56.440, Speaker A: You got you were in.
00:43:57.210 - 00:43:59.910, Speaker B: Was like I was coming back to get stuck there.
00:43:59.980 - 00:44:00.310, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:44:00.380 - 00:44:11.694, Speaker B: For years, I was coming back to us to look at MBA programs, actually. And I get back the day that Wuhan shuts down. The next day, my boss calls me and he goes, hey, don't return. Don't come back to China. Never went back to China after that. I mean, I did go back.
00:44:11.732 - 00:44:12.570, Speaker A: You've been back summer.
00:44:12.650 - 00:44:20.910, Speaker B: Because my wife is chinese. She's the best. But shout out to. Anyway, as I started to.
00:44:20.980 - 00:44:31.202, Speaker A: You really dodged a bullet on that COVID lockdown, because we saw the stuff in China. I don't know what to believe. It was the Internet. You never know. But it looked very aggressive. Lockdown situation.
00:44:31.336 - 00:44:35.362, Speaker B: I had a lot of friends who were there and kind of stuck it out for a while, but eventually able to leave.
00:44:35.416 - 00:44:35.822, Speaker A: Eventually.
00:44:35.886 - 00:45:07.040, Speaker B: Eventually they were able. Yeah, people were able to leave. It was more of just people kind of like, maybe didn't have places to go and know there's a lot of expats living in China who can't go. So it's tough. But anyway, so I came back, I did my MBA, and before I started my MBA, I kind of had a little free time, and I really just started to be like, all right, if I'm invested in this stuff, I should understand what it is. So I took, like, a coursera course from insead on crypto blockchain and Defi gave me kind of these building blocks. And then I had a buddy who was like.
00:45:07.040 - 00:45:12.960, Speaker B: He used to do, like, YouTube streams, but great guy. Love him.
00:45:13.410 - 00:45:14.670, Speaker A: I love how you're discounting that.
00:45:14.740 - 00:45:36.386, Speaker B: He was driving Grubhub and streaming. Driving Grubhub so that he would take his profits from Grubhub and buy crypto grinding. It was grinding. And I just reached out to him, I was like, hey, I kind of want to use this stuff. He basically introduced me at the deep underbelly of crypto, so I never started at the bitcoin ETH level. He was like, let's go to Polygon.
00:45:36.418 - 00:45:39.254, Speaker A: And you went right in the dirty stuff.
00:45:39.292 - 00:46:00.606, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. But that was great. It really showed me, like, all right, this is how communities are built in crypto. This is how Defi happens. This is how you identify trends and narratives. And what it really instilled in me is the only way to truly know what's happening is to be actually using these chains. And you never should be discounting any chain until you've tried it.
00:46:00.606 - 00:46:31.702, Speaker B: So I was on Polygon for a while, and then I saw this mint happening on Solana that I thought literally, I was just like, the art looks awesome. Why don't I try it? Did the mint and never looked back. It was the best, actually. The mint went terribly. It took, like, 48 hours to actually get it done because the network kept getting congested. But once it happened and I started transacting on the network, just the difference between using Salana and using any other chain was so extreme. I was like, wow, this is the user experience.
00:46:31.702 - 00:46:51.934, Speaker B: It's still very rough around the edges, but this is kind of what you need. And so from there, I got very involved. I started out as kind of like an NFT community person, got very involved in NFTs. That led me to get interested in all other areas of the thing. And as I was doing my MBA, I kind of just thought to myself, like, this is what I spend. I'm not even going to my know. This is what I spend all day doing.
00:46:51.934 - 00:47:00.226, Speaker B: And I love reading about it. I love researching it, I love using it. Why is this not what I'm doing full time and was very fortunate to get connected with you and end up here.
00:47:00.328 - 00:47:17.494, Speaker A: Yeah. I should actually remind our audience because Lucas was an intern at Galaxy Research before he graduated from Georgetown MBA, and then, of course, now works at Galaxy research. But you may remember if you're a longtime Galaxy brains listener, Lucas was on galaxy brains, actually, your third appearance, I think.
00:47:17.532 - 00:47:18.102, Speaker B: Yes, it is.
00:47:18.156 - 00:47:21.382, Speaker A: You were on in summer 2022 telling us about Maker Dow.
00:47:21.446 - 00:47:22.106, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:47:22.288 - 00:47:37.470, Speaker A: Which is just another hilariously overly complex and. But that gives a lot of interesting things to talk about. Well, Lucas, thank you for coming to galaxy brains, and we'll connect again soon. Lucas Chian from Galaxy Research.
