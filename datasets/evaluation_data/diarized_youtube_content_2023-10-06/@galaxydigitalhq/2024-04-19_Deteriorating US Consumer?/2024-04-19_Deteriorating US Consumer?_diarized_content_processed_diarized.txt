There was a company today, a freight company, and they basically were like, this quarter, our loads are down and their expenses are also high because of things like car insurance, commodities, energy prices. Their margins are getting squeezed because people want less stuff. And in order to do the exact same activity, the cost of that has gone up. And there are also a couple of consumer discretionary companies, retailers that have given guidance recently, and that guidance has been not so great. And so there's actually genuine concern about the US consumer.
