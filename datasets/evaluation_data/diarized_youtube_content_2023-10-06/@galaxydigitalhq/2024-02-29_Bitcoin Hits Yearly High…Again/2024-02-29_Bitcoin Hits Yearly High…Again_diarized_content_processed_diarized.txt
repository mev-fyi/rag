00:00:00.440 - 00:00:04.814, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:04.934 - 00:00:06.154, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:06.454 - 00:00:39.964, Speaker A: So, you know, bitcoin, I guess, is technically flat a little bit, although what we did earlier this week hit a yearly high of, like, nearly 53k. But now we're back in the 51 range. I mean, it's basically the same range. We've been over 50k for nine consecutive days. Ether has outperformed a little bit in the last week or two, but still, I would say below where it was the last time bitcoin was at 50k. So still also kind of in its range in the scheme of things. So not a ton of news, crypto, major price action wise, since we last spoke.
00:00:39.964 - 00:00:43.244, Speaker A: Is that your view of the crypto markets at the moment?
00:00:43.704 - 00:00:57.184, Speaker B: Yeah. I would tell you that the price action we've seen over the past week is incredibly constructive. What you're seeing is an asset class maturing in front of your face.
