00:00:00.200 - 00:00:50.024, Speaker A: Why this also. Why the proof act also? Sure. I think that's a great question as well. And it really kind of boils down to, on our end, we saw a very acute instance occur with FTX and the implosion of FTX, where there were a number of misgovernance and malfeasance actions that occurred there that, you know, if you took something such as the proof act, would pretty readily address that. You know, with FTX, you saw that they were comingling institutional and customer funds, and with FTX, you saw that they were diverting customer funds to subsidiary, which was allamated research. And I think Sandra Tillis is a big fan of taking something that is happening, a real world event, and trying to craft a solution to that. I think that's certainly something that Senator Hickenlooper brings to the table as well, too, in his approach.
