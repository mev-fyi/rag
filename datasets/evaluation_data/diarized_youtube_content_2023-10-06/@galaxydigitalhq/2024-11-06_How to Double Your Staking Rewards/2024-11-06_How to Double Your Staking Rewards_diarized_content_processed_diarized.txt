00:00:00.320 - 00:00:49.293, Speaker A: So, speaking of learnings, let's start with pleasant learnings with things that we like about simpledvt. And the first thing is definitely the increase of number of node operators. So with SimpleDVT, 220 net new node operators joined LiDAR. So before SimpleDBT there has been 37 active node operators in LIDA. With SimpleDVT we are now at the point where there's two hundred and fifty seven independent node operators, which is astonishing. This is like super cool. And the coolest thing is that almost half of this, or even more than a half, like around 120 of this node operators are pure community stakers.
00:00:49.293 - 00:00:56.405, Speaker A: So they are not professionals or semi professionals. They are pure home and community stakers, which is great.
