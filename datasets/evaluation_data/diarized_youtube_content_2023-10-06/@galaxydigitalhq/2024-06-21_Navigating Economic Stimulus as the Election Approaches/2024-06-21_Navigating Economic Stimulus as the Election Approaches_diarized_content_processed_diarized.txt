00:00:07.160 - 00:00:12.006, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy brains.
00:00:12.110 - 00:00:13.094, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.214 - 00:00:37.680, Speaker A: What is happening? Because we are recording this a day earlier than we normally do. So it's Tuesday the 17th, sorry, Tuesday the 18th. And so it hasn't been that long since we talked last Wednesday, but some data came in. I mean, where did we stand? I saw a headline that said a big bank was maintaining their two cuts before the end of the year outlook. Despite hawkish language last week from the FOMC stuff. Where do we stand in your mind?
00:00:37.872 - 00:01:16.194, Speaker B: I think that the Fed is going to be more inclined to cut this year than was stated during FOMC versus what they had in the dot plot. I think you've seen CPI data turn lower and key components in CPI move lower, like housing came in at 0.3, PPI was soft. And if you extrapolate the components of CPI and PPI, you're looking at a PCE print next week that is gonna be anywhere from like 0.15 to 0.2. The Cleveland nowcast has it at 0.21 month on month.
00:01:16.194 - 00:02:03.340, Speaker B: And so you're looking at an annualized PCE number that's gonna be close to like your two six area, which is right on target, which is what the Fed wants. In addition, you've seen softening in employment indicators. You've seen, although non farm payrolls is the small exception to that. And then you've also seen retail sales missed to the downside today and over the past couple of releases. In addition to that, you had revisions lower to retail sales of the prior month today. So it looks like spending is coming in soft. You've got inflation indicators that are moving more towards target and you've got employment kind of softening as well.
00:02:03.340 - 00:03:01.422, Speaker B: And that means that the Fed is definitely headed in the right direction and could certainly be warranted in cuts. Taking it a step further, I think that the data is going to continue to deteriorate over the next couple of months. We're going to see probably a bigger uptick in unemployment as a function of some revisions, and you're probably going to see continued slowing in broader economic trends as well. And then you're going to start to be in a situation whereby the September FOMC or even the July FOMC where it really makes sense to start cutting. Because if you think inflation is moving to target and you're confident that it's moving to target, then you are probably 200 basis points too high in terms of where rates are currently set, neutral is probably somewhere close to 3%. And right now, the Fed funds range is 525 to 550. And so that means you could, in theory, be very far away from neutral.
00:03:01.422 - 00:03:57.188, Speaker B: So I really think that you're on the cusp of a very significant kind of light switch going off in the market. That being that data's turned enough to warrant cutting. And if logically, you're at the point where you're like, I'm comfortable cutting, then you should really be thinking about the magnitude of your cut and how quickly you should be doing your cuts to get to neutral. And so I really think you're on the cusp of the market starting to think about cuts in the 50 bp increment, back to back fifties even. Because realistically, if unemployment really is coming lower, I've got a guy telling me that the payroll revisions coming out in August are going to take unemployment close to four three. The summary of economic projections that were released for June during last FOMC had unemployment going to 4%. Right.
00:03:57.188 - 00:04:00.564, Speaker B: And so I think we're at three nine now. And so if you could.
00:04:00.604 - 00:04:01.196, Speaker A: Pretty big jump.
00:04:01.260 - 00:04:22.733, Speaker B: You could be at, like 4243 pretty quickly. And then you're going to tell me that peak core PCE is at 2.6%, which is, let's just say that's pretty good. And so quickly, the market could be at a point where they're like, wow, employment softening. Inflation is softening. Everything seems to be turning lower. So why are we at 5%?
00:04:22.853 - 00:04:36.965, Speaker A: And now this is the soft landing attempt. Right? Because the other argument would be that the risk of reinflation is so high that, like, it can still bear more. Yes, but the danger from that is that you end up having the economy have a pretty hard landing.
00:04:37.029 - 00:04:37.341, Speaker B: Correct.
00:04:37.397 - 00:04:42.189, Speaker A: Because once you start accelerating from 3.9, you're seeing the 4.3. That's a pretty big jump if that were to happen.
00:04:42.301 - 00:04:43.077, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:04:43.125 - 00:04:51.464, Speaker A: All of a sudden, it's like, holy crap, unemployment pictures looking a lot worse, better if you want to cut worse. If you are, there are so many.
00:04:51.504 - 00:04:56.720, Speaker B: Things that already are signaling, like, you know, part time employment this year is up 18%.
00:04:56.832 - 00:05:10.088, Speaker A: Well, isn't that a big, like, you know, you look at these numbers. Isn't that a big part of the unemployment picture when we say that, you know, when the president, for example, takes credit for having unemployment come down so much in a lot of those jobs, like doordash and stuff like that?
00:05:10.136 - 00:05:10.978, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:05:11.056 - 00:05:12.110, Speaker A: Like, more than ever before.
00:05:12.182 - 00:05:24.926, Speaker B: And there are, like, estimates about sole proprietorships how many jobs that those things at. And so there's lots of weird anomalies, and Powell is openly talking about it. And so, and that's why they pay attention to things like the revisions.
00:05:24.990 - 00:05:54.266, Speaker A: So is there a, we've talked before on this podcast about, for example, Trump politically or the White House generally politically, either trying to influence the Fed or not influence the fed or the Fed's role in that sort of political situation? Like wouldn't cut, like big cuts or like any cuts even right before the election. I mean, isn't there some risk, I think you might have said before that theoretically you'd prefer not to do that if you're trying to not to appear to be apolitical, doesn't that have a big impact, you think? I mean, one way or another.
00:05:54.450 - 00:06:11.296, Speaker B: I mean, at the end of the day, there's a ton of people that vote with their wallets. They don't care if the politicians are giving them the money or it's a private corporation. And so I think there's a lot of voters that are like, I'm happy with where my wallet is and what policies are. And so I might, because if they.
00:06:11.320 - 00:06:20.920, Speaker A: Cut rates, it gets easier to buy homes cheaper and possibly your assets go up. So you possibly, maybe. I mean, no, no, it's, well, probably in the long run, totally possible.
00:06:21.032 - 00:06:57.570, Speaker B: But what I would say, though, is I would pay attention to the measures that are currently being talked about by the administration. They're stupor, stimulative. Right. They're talking about more relief for first time homebuyers or first generation homebuyers. I think there was a program announced the other day that gives you 25k back, which is tantamount to closing costs on the average home these days. There are more measures to enhance Social Security in terms of eligibility. Folks that are on SNaP benefits, they might now become more eligible to receive some Social Security benefits.
00:06:57.570 - 00:07:13.098, Speaker B: There's chatter about home equity loans and what Fannie and Freddie can do to help assist in that. And so what you're basically seeing from the democratic administration is all hands effort to stimulate the economy going into the election.
00:07:13.146 - 00:07:20.882, Speaker A: So fair. So it's part of your point that a 25 bit cut or even a 50 bit cut, they're already doing plenty on the election side of it regardless.
00:07:20.938 - 00:07:23.714, Speaker B: So it's not like, and asset prices are at the dead highs.
00:07:23.754 - 00:07:29.400, Speaker A: Look at the stock market. I mean, do they just go, let's say we go on a cutting cycle. They just keep going.
00:07:29.552 - 00:07:49.656, Speaker B: I mean, I heard it best the other day. Some guy was like, so people were telling me that bad news is good news for stocks. And then when there's good news, people are telling me good news is good news for stocks. And this week I heard that no news is also good for stocks. So we're just stuck in the point where it looks like it's one of the best hedges in the world.
00:07:49.760 - 00:07:54.546, Speaker A: And if you look at it, is a great hedge, right? I mean, a classic inflation head is equities, right?
00:07:54.570 - 00:07:54.746, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:54.770 - 00:08:01.178, Speaker A: And they earn cash. They. But also if you look at the, like, I don't know, multi decade history of the us stock not on.
00:08:01.266 - 00:08:05.162, Speaker B: And it doesn't matter what administration is in office. Administrative agnostic.
00:08:05.298 - 00:08:16.410, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, is it, this is a little bit more existential just for the last minute or two here, but is it really up? Have you seen that, like, adjusted for inflation chart where like, the peak was like 1929 in the us stock market?
00:08:16.482 - 00:08:16.786, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:16.850 - 00:08:21.424, Speaker A: Like if we adjust for like m two or whichever metric we need, it's actually like on a real basis.
00:08:21.464 - 00:08:29.872, Speaker B: Like kind of the big popular one among crypto folks is like relative to the balance sheet. And so, yeah, you know, you could think about it.
00:08:29.928 - 00:08:32.848, Speaker A: Maybe that's why it's up. Cause the dollar is weakening and this.
00:08:32.856 - 00:08:34.640, Speaker B: Is just another expression of that.
00:08:34.712 - 00:08:37.064, Speaker A: Well, it's maybe one way to at least tread water.
00:08:37.184 - 00:08:37.528, Speaker B: Yes.
00:08:37.576 - 00:08:46.272, Speaker A: The other thing is, isn't it mostly just like we don't like to name single name equities, but isn't it mostly just like one stock that's basically leading or like a handful?
00:08:46.368 - 00:09:27.636, Speaker B: It's like four, five, and the magnificent seven is what they're known as. And the big part of about them that's very unique from any other point in history is the magnitude of the stock buybacks programs that they have. They are literally constantly on the bid for their own shares. Every day that passes that those programs are active is less supply, less float in those companies, and there's a constant bid. And then you have the performance issue where folks are benchmarked to these indexes, and these indexes just keep outperforming most of these folks. And so they're forced to chase and you're gonna have another Santa Claus rally going to the election. And if you're not long, these big names, you're short.
00:09:27.636 - 00:09:35.004, Speaker B: And so it becomes one of those things where, you know, you just have to keep up and it becomes, you know, very self fulfilling. Exactly.
00:09:35.044 - 00:09:42.116, Speaker A: I mean, even I didn't want to buy some of these big AI stocks, like, and now you're like three months ago. I thought I was super late, and I was.
00:09:42.220 - 00:09:45.580, Speaker B: No, I mean, we could talk about the AI. I really.
00:09:45.692 - 00:09:47.148, Speaker A: They called the AI rally.
00:09:47.276 - 00:09:49.548, Speaker B: Yeah, like. No, but Nick Carter, by the way.
00:09:49.556 - 00:09:54.348, Speaker A: It'S not just that one stock. It's several of those stocks. All have big AI components and.
00:09:54.396 - 00:10:05.466, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. And honestly, I think that the AI theme is here to last for decades to come. It's got implications on everything from power to productivity.
00:10:05.530 - 00:10:06.930, Speaker A: That's what Nick was saying on the podium.
00:10:07.002 - 00:10:34.946, Speaker B: And he's actually tweeting some good essays out this weekend, one of which I read. But what startled me was really how folks are dramatically underestimating the power demand growth that we're going to see over the next decade. I heard, you know, a couple months ago, you know, I was hearing figures that were like, 10% increase in power production is needed. And the paper I read is like, that's. You need at least 20% plus.
00:10:35.010 - 00:10:38.218, Speaker A: Wow. Well, it's gonna be. It's gonna be a big deal.
00:10:38.266 - 00:10:38.522, Speaker B: That.
00:10:38.578 - 00:10:47.934, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, the amount of electricity. This was just crazy. We need nuclear. I'm coming back on the nuclear train, but we'll save that for another conversation. Bim net of BB Gatsby, my friend, thank you so much.
00:10:47.974 - 00:10:48.494, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
