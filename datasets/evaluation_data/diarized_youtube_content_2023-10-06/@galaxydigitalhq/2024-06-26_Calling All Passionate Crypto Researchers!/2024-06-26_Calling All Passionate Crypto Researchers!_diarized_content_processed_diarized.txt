And I personally would love some help, you know, covering these calls, being able to have a stand in similar to how Tim has a stand in when he's not able to chair the calls to come and help me cover Ethereum protocol development. So if you are listening to this show and you also are very passionate about crypto research and passionate about Ethereum protocol development from a research angle, consider applying to the open positions for Galaxy research.
