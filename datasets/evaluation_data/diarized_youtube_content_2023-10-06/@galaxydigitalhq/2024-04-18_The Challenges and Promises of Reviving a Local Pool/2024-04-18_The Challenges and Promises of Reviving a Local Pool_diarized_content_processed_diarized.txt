00:00:00.160 - 00:00:09.966, Speaker A: So I don't know about you, but I personally can't go to the grocery store, the library, the gas station without somebody asking me when the pool is going to be done. Or what about the pool?
00:00:10.070 - 00:00:28.766, Speaker B: Our goal to begin construction on the pool is by the end of the month. Everybody in the community that knows I'm working on that project, they're always asking, when are we going to start it? Are we still going to do it? And I just assure them that it's a commitment that we are going to stick behind and complete.
00:00:28.910 - 00:00:36.798, Speaker A: My experience is people seem to be a little skeptical at this point on whether or not the pool even can be done, if it even is fixable.
00:00:36.926 - 00:00:57.824, Speaker B: It's not as simple as everybody might think. So a bunch of the equipment is going to have to be replaced and trying to stay within the footprint of the old pool without completely ripping it out and starting over. Like I said, it's just posed a couple challenges. We're wanting it to last generations, and so we're making sure that project is done the right way.
