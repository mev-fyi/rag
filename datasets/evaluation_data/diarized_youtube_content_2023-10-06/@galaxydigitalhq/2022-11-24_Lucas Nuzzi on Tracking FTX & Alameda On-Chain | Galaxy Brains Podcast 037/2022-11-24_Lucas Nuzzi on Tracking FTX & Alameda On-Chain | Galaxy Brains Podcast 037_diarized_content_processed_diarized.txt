00:00:01.440 - 00:00:34.416, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. And we have a great show for you today. We're joined by Lucas Nutse, head of research and development at Coin Metrics. He's one of the top on chain analysts in the world, and he uncovered incredible on chain evidence of FTX and Alameda's malfeasance. He's going to share with you, our, our listeners on the show. First, we'll talk with Bimnet Abibi, though, from Galaxy Digital trading about markets, lots of numbers released today in the macro world.
00:00:34.416 - 00:01:15.084, Speaker A: And then me and Christine Kim will talk about FTX bankruptcy hearings and fallout at digital currency group and Genesis Trading. But before we get to all of that, please refer to the disclaimers in the link on the podcast notes. And note that none of the information provided during this podcast constitutes investment advice or a recommendation, solicitation, or offer by Galaxy Digital or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. We got that disclaimer out of the way, so let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet abb from Galaxy Digital trading. Bim, how are you doing? What do markets look like? And I saw where there were some numbers released today. What did the numbers look like?
00:01:15.244 - 00:02:01.872, Speaker B: I mean, there was a whole host of numbers released this morning, you know, partially as a function of, you know, the holiday tomorrow. But we got an okay read on the US economy. Durable good orders came in pretty strong. New home sales came in pretty strong. Consumer confidence and inflation expectations were okay. What you saw after the broader set of data was equities continuing to rally and fixed income kind of going bid. And like right now, I'm very sort of perplexed in terms of what the response function is to data with respect to the market high level.
00:02:01.872 - 00:03:12.280, Speaker B: What that really means is, is good news good news or is good news bad news? Right. Is good news going to force the Fed to hike more aggressively, or is it going to do the opposite? And I think you're at a very interesting sort of inflection point, and that just has to do with sort of the structural setup in the US. I'll start with just the labor market. Everyone's been hearing about all the tech layoffs, et cetera, but what nobody's really talking about is sort of the onshoring that's going on. And so to put some numbers to it, I think there have been in the past couple of months, like 120,000 of jobs in that were laid off in us tech. But there's been over 300,000 in gains as a function of onshoring in terms of bringing production from abroad here. And so that leaves you with still an incredibly tight labor market and yet the interest rate markets are pricing in sort of higher for longer.
00:03:12.280 - 00:03:25.874, Speaker B: And, and more importantly though, you're pricing in a pretty sort of significant slowdown in growth on the back of this higher policy. And that's why you're seeing the curve as inverted as it is.
00:03:25.914 - 00:03:26.066, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:26.090 - 00:04:10.384, Speaker B: 210S right now is neg 77, right. The front end being 77 basis points higher than the back end tells you that the market is expecting a pretty severe slowdown in growth, but yet you're not really seeing it in the data. We added there were 600 plus thousand in new home sales. The fact that mortgage rates are at six 7% isn't materially slowing down the housing market. It depends on where you're looking. And prices are obviously moving lower but it really hasn't flinched. And unemployment is still well below 4% and yet the market is know is pricing in all this sort of negative growth stuff.
00:04:10.384 - 00:04:24.536, Speaker B: So I think you're just at such a very weird and interesting point with respect to how the market's supposed to respond to good data, bad data. Happy to dive deeper there.
00:04:24.600 - 00:04:56.314, Speaker A: Yeah. Is there seasonality here? And I mean that in the classic economic sense, but also in a more psychological sense. We've got the holidays coming up. Everyone knows this was a rough year, I think. Is it possible people, including employers but also consumers are saying let's just ride it out. Let's not dramatically shift between now and the new year, but then maybe once we're all freezing our butts off and slushy snow in the cities in January and February, then the reality sets in and everybody tightens the belt.
00:04:57.214 - 00:06:00.922, Speaker B: There are definitely seasonal components to this stuff. Like there's a lot of labor force hiring that's associated with the holidays, retailers, shipping companies, whatever it may be. So that's one seasonality too. October and November in us equity markets are typically periods where the market rallies on a pretty consistent basis. It's known as the Santa Claus rally and I love looking at it on those, the monthly grid charts of green and red and you can see past 1015 years, October, November tend to be very good months. And so there's a lot of that in addition, like corporations do a lot of their planning for the next year in the latter months of the prior year. And so yeah, I do think that there's some pretty strong seasonality elements as to why things seem a little bit peachier than they should be or peachier than what front end rates at 5% should be implying.
00:06:00.922 - 00:06:34.702, Speaker B: So yeah, there is a seasonal component to it. And I do expect that once you make it through the turn of the year, that more of the reality starts to sort of bake into the market and just backing up. I think one of the things that people don't realize with high interest rate policy is that it works very methodically and slowly. Every day that a person isn't invested in the market, their opportunity cost of their money is 5%.
00:06:34.798 - 00:06:35.246, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:35.350 - 00:07:02.800, Speaker B: So if three months go by, you will have lost 1.25% in interest accruing every day. And every day that you're not in these fixed income products, or every day you're just sitting on idle cash, your opportunity costs is just growing and growing. And so there's a reason why people say monetary policy works on a lag, and that's because it does.
00:07:02.832 - 00:07:02.976, Speaker A: Right?
00:07:03.000 - 00:08:13.464, Speaker B: Think about if you're a business and you have a floating rate debt that you're constantly paying and interest rates have moved a lot higher every day you're operating, you're having to pay those interest rates and they add up. Same thing in terms of marginal consumption, marginal consumption and marginal loan behavior, stuff that happens at high interest rates. And so when interest rates are high, less and less marginal activity, less and less marginal borrowing happens. To put that all together, when you have tight financial conditions, which is what you have now, every day of tight financial conditions impacts the markets, and over time you'll see the compounded effects. That's what I think will happen at the start of the year, where it'll be six months of really high interest rate policy. Those compounded effects will start to hit the market at the start of the year. And so my outlook for Q one, Q two is pretty bearish in terms of broader equity markets and risk sentiment.
00:08:13.464 - 00:08:20.724, Speaker B: I think the move is to get back into trend at some point, which is long dollar short rates and short us equities.
00:08:22.294 - 00:08:48.914, Speaker A: Lastly, bimnet on crypto markets. I know not much has changed from last week when things looked really bad. I mean, I guess we've got a little bit of, I don't even want to call it strength, some firmness around the 16,000 mark and 1100 on ETH, which is a positive. It seems like maybe the bleeding has, I don't even want to say stopped, but paused at least. Anything else interesting that you're seeing in crypto?
00:08:49.814 - 00:09:39.794, Speaker B: I mean, tons of stuff, right. I think there's a lot of interesting sort of basis trades to be doing in markets, right? Like December CME futures are trading at a 30% annualized discount to spot, right. There's lots of good sort of defi CFI arbitrage trades out there. And even things like GBTC, you've had that discount move from almost NeG 50 back closer to NeG 40. So there's lots of sort of interesting basis cheaper bitcoin. There's also healthy amount of activity in FTX claims, in Celsius claims. So there's been a lot of interest in the bankruptcy proceedings, especially from traditional institutions.
00:09:39.794 - 00:10:52.832, Speaker B: So lots of interesting stuff happening in crypto. But in terms of just spot BTC and spot ETH, like you mentioned, I think there's been the overhang of all this bad news. But as time passes, more and more uncertainty gets priced out of the market, and I think that's generally constructive for upside in crypto. If people are totally comfortable with the various scenarios that DCG and genesis can go in, people are getting more comfortable with the FTX claims process, people are getting more comfortable with the idea that grayscale is probably not going to turn on redemptions, et cetera. I think as you remove those elements of uncertainty for the market, people will go back to more. So the fundamentals, and the fundamentals are bitcoin is a fundamentally groundbreaking technology that's been around for 14 years that has a very aggressive investor base that's not only retail, but it's institutional. There are trusted counterparties, custodians, a whole ecosystem around it.
00:10:52.832 - 00:11:51.704, Speaker B: ETH as well. You've had strong monetary policy or economic improvements that you've had on chain activity is still going to be around. People are still going to be interested in nfts and all of the various activities that you can do on chain. I definitely think people will take a step back once they're more comfortable with the variables at play and see value in this space. And that's kind of where I'm at. And one of my favorite things to do at the end of the year is typically look at what's been the most underperforming thing. I think people call it the dogs of the Dow or something like that, where every year you're supposed to look at the bottom three underperformers in the Dow Jones industrial average, and historically the bottom three tend to be the ones that outperform the next year.
00:11:51.704 - 00:12:45.154, Speaker B: It has a very high hit rate, at least the last time I looked at. Interesting, you look at things like that. The classic 60 40 equity bond portfolio had one of its worst years ever in 2022. Maybe investing in a 60 40 bond portfolio this year, you're probably going to. It's probably much better risk reward right now, and I honestly think that's probably a decent strategy. But I often look at sort of what's super stretched, what has really been overextended this year, and try to do the opposite of it at the start of the year. And I think crypto is one of those fantastic opportunities where you've had a huge correction in the market and you're at sort of bargain prices, I think, in bitcoin and ethereum at least.
00:12:45.154 - 00:12:50.374, Speaker B: And so I'm optimistic for 2023, and there's a lot to look forward to.
00:12:51.234 - 00:13:06.254, Speaker A: Bim Netabee, the maven of markets, our friend from Galaxy Digital trading. Thank you so much, as always, my friend. Welcome. Lucas Nutsy from Coinmetrics, an excellent on chain data analyst, the chieftain of chains. Lucas. Welcome, my friend.
00:13:07.104 - 00:13:09.564, Speaker C: Thank you, Alex. Appreciate you having me on.
00:13:10.624 - 00:13:33.964, Speaker A: Great to have you here. Lucas, you've been covering the FTX fallout in sort of real time. On chain coinmetrics, for those who don't know, is a blockchain data and analytics company that specialized originally in on chain data, still does, but also has added significant market data capabilities as well. Lucas, you run labs at coinmetrics. What does that mean?
00:13:34.904 - 00:14:16.314, Speaker C: So labs is our R and D unit at climate metrics, and we do data engineering and data science. That's basically what we do. The research portion of R and D focuses on engineering, which means we're collecting data on areas that are difficult to collect data on, the blockchain corners that take a lot of data engineering and effort to collect data from, and then also the science around it, which is aggregating that data, harmonizing that data, and hopefully shedding light on things that folks don't really know or see by simply just running a node.
00:14:16.694 - 00:14:41.794, Speaker A: So let's talk about some of those things people didn't see that you've been covering related to FTX in particular. In fact, even just yesterday, you tweeted. Over the past few weeks, my team at coinmetrics has been obsessed with answering one question. How did Alameda manage to lose billions of dollars of FTX user funds? You guys have some answers that you want to give me the rundown here? How did Alameda manage to do that?
00:14:43.134 - 00:16:11.934, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, first of all, we were shocked with news coming out of FTX, right? I think everyone was, but we were also shocked at looking at their activities on chain over time, the extent to which some red flags were obvious, even if you don't have a ton of experience with on chain data. And we basically started chasing all of their activities on chain, the protocols that they were interacting with, the counterparties that they have had historically. And a really unhealthy relationship between FTX and Alameda emerged. It was a really clear picture of that. What we recently discovered is that the funds that belonged to FTX users were likely being taken out of FTX and allocated to Alameda over the course of many, many months, really starting in 2021. If you look at the, you can look at all this information on chain and actually understand the outflows, which is money being sent from these addresses, and the inflows, which is the money that is being received from these addresses, and you can actually see the nature of those operations. These might be funds that are being sent to an exchange.
00:16:11.934 - 00:17:14.973, Speaker C: These might be funds that are being received from a DeFi protocol, and you can really characterize the actions of an address on chain by looking at that. And the very first red flag in this broader analysis that we're doing is that Alameda was frequently receiving funds from FTX in the form of liquid crypto assets. So bitcoin, ether stable coins, several ERC 20 tokens, as well as illiquid assets. So think about all the Solana ecosystem tokens, various tokens that were bootstrapped by FTX, by folks within FTX. But as Alameda was receiving a lot of those funds, you didn't really see a whole lot of outflows going from Alameda back to FTX. And it was a very simple script that we used to find this out. But I think it speaks to the level of failure that this is in terms of due diligence.
00:17:14.973 - 00:17:45.654, Speaker C: FTX was able to perpetuate one of the biggest scams in financial history, and there were some red flags on chain that were very obvious. This unhealthy relationship certainly was very obvious. So that was a big finding in our study, was that there was this unidirectionality of funds coming out of FTX, going into Alameda and not returning. That was unhealthy to begin with.
00:17:46.634 - 00:18:05.654, Speaker D: Lucas, why don't you think that those red flags were caught sooner? Like, if it is so clear on chain that an address labeled as FTX is sending ginormous amounts to an address labeled as elemedia and no funds are moving back, how come that wasn't picked up sooner?
00:18:06.754 - 00:18:52.684, Speaker C: It's a great question. I think it speaks to a level of deficiency that a lot of companies have right now in being able to produce this level of analysis. On chain data is very novel. It's novel even for us. Like, depending on which corners that we're looking at, there are new topics that are coming in related to on chain data every day. And I don't think folks that were supposed to be doing this level of due diligence had the tools to be able to do that. We used a tool called Atlas to find all of these interesting tidbits that signaled Big Red and some orange flags.
00:18:52.684 - 00:20:13.324, Speaker C: And I don't think they had these tools at their disposal. And I think the traditional structure to perform due diligence on a company, when you think about traditional financial institutions, they're used to a lot more data, a lot more intel on these companies that are completely different paradigm in the on chain world, and they're trying to retrofit these due diligence questionnaires and practices into crypto and crypto companies. But this is really a different paradigm, and I don't think they have the tools or necessarily the talent at this point to be able to identify these red flags. So one of the things that inspires me and that I think is interesting about this is that we're really approaching the golden age of on chain analysis, I think, for both due diligence purposes as well as investment purposes, understanding the nature of these tokens, how they're operating, who's actually using them. But I think it really speaks to that lack of due diligence and this too much of trying to retrofit existing due diligence frameworks into crypto, when crypto is really something very different.
00:20:13.784 - 00:20:18.604, Speaker A: Lucas, what was Alameda doing with these funds, to the best of your knowledge?
00:20:20.224 - 00:21:01.378, Speaker C: Yeah. So in order to find that out, we basically looked at every single transaction that went out of their wallet and into different smart contracts. So just for context, smart contracts, they're implemented as addresses on the blockchain. They just happen to have code associated with them, and we can read the code associated with those addresses and understand. Okay, this address here is a decentralized exchange, or this address is a DeFi lending protocol. And we did that for every single transaction that Alameda performed over the course of 2021 and 2022. Wow.
00:21:01.378 - 00:21:09.154, Speaker C: That's why the obsessed part of my tweet was very real. We were doing some really deep analysis.
00:21:09.194 - 00:21:11.858, Speaker A: On literally every transaction Alameda ever did.
00:21:11.906 - 00:21:45.490, Speaker C: Basically in the past. Yeah, two years, roughly speaking. And, you know, we're talking about in the orders of over a million outflows. And the tool that we used, it was really built for this. It really is helpful in doing these bigger analysis, but you still have for each one of them to add context to those transactions. And this is where, you know, labels are useful. Right.
00:21:45.490 - 00:22:40.122, Speaker C: So we're using our own heuristics as well as third parties to understand who's behind that address. Is it a smart contract, and if so, which application does it represents? And when we applied that to Alameda, we saw that they were really on the. If you think about the risk spectrum, they were engaging in incredibly risky activity. They were engaging with very nascent, novel protocols that were not tested, and they were doing so with billions of dollars on a monthly basis. So that was really fascinating, especially their use of cross chain bridges. As we know, last year, and even this year, we've had several high profile bridge hacks. Bridges, there are security nightmares.
00:22:40.122 - 00:23:13.230, Speaker C: They're very difficult to implement properly. So as a result, you've seen, you know, so many bridges just get hacked, and they've interacted with a lot of these bridges. They've interacted with wormhole, and that might explain part of where the funds might have gone to. And they didn't really tell anyone that they were one of the folks that got hacked in that process, but they were really fearless when it comes to interacting with these protocols, and that was the second kind of biggest insight there.
00:23:13.382 - 00:23:44.274, Speaker A: Yeah. And it looks like I'm looking at the data, which you tweeted, the vast majority of the transaction outflows to Alameda. Sorry. Outflows from Alameda wallets into these various other applications was also, like, the last quarter and towards the, I guess, probably Q three, Q four of last year, 2021. You had speculated that it was possible that Alameda was even essentially broke by the time Luna even happened. How do you arrive at that?
00:23:45.374 - 00:25:11.756, Speaker C: Yeah, if you look at the outflow of funds that Alameda was sending out, the majority of that happened in Q four of 2021, when all crypto assets decreased quite considerably. And given what we know about their strategy and the nature of how they're trading, that tells me that they made a really bad trade in Q four. Maybe they were long and levered, and as markets contracted, they might have taken a pretty big hit. Hypothesize that, because after Q four, we noticed a considerable decrease in outflows from their wallets. They still retain a lot of tokens, especially ERC 20 tokens, but they weren't really moving those tokens as much. And the moves that they did after that really spoke to the desperation involved. Basically, their risk profile after Q four of 2021 became a lot more focused on illiquid tokens and became very damning when it comes to their activities.
00:25:11.756 - 00:25:45.168, Speaker C: They weren't really trading as many stable coins as an example. And what that tells me, at least, is that something happened in Q four. It might have been that they were directionally wrong and they took a pretty massive hit. We know that from the filings, from the bankruptcy filings. I believe they already had a $3.7 billion hole FTX did in their balance sheets, and who knows, in terms of, from an accounting perspective, how they structure that. But it might have been that Alameda.
00:25:45.168 - 00:26:03.164, Speaker C: Alameda was a lot worse. So there is that possibility that by the time Terra blew up, they were impacted because they still were holding crypto, but the impact was a lot lower than what happened in Q four of last year.
00:26:05.024 - 00:26:18.484, Speaker A: I see another interesting thing real quick. On the second chart that you tweeted yesterday, there's in week 38 of this year, which I guess would be around September, it looks like there's a $4 billion outfit flow from Alameda back to FTX.
00:26:19.944 - 00:27:31.610, Speaker C: Yeah, that was the, in my opinion, the smoking gun that a bailout, or at least an advance actually happened. And I found myself in a crazy on chain rabbit hole a couple of weeks ago when FTX hadn't even, I think was the 9th. FTX hadn't really file for bankruptcy just yet. But what ended up happening was we captured one of the largest transfers of ERC 20 token in the history of the token standard on September 28 of this year. And I remember looking at that and thinking through, I wonder what this represents, what transaction this was? It was an FTT transaction, or actually two transactions, transfers totaling, I believe, over $8 billion in total cents within that day. And when it happened, we really didn't think too much about it. It was just odd.
00:27:31.610 - 00:28:32.640, Speaker C: It was gigantic as a daily transfer. But when this whole situation emerged and it was clear that Alameda NFDX, they were blowing up, I decided to actually look into all those transfers that happened that day, and I ranked them, and I wanted to find the biggest ones and start from there. And I found these two very incriminating transactions, that the first transaction was actually a vesting transaction. So for context, you can implement vesting schedules using smart contracts. So if I launch a token, and I want you to have part of the supply of that token in two years, I can add that logic to the blockchain very simply, and have, in two years, the tokens being dispersed to you if you're an early investor, for example. But I don't want you to unwind all of your positions all at once. I can do that.
00:28:32.640 - 00:29:08.454, Speaker C: And that's exactly what that contract was. It was releasing billions of FTT, billions of dollars worth of FTT. I think, I believe $4.2 billion worth at the time. And it went into Alameda's wallet. The moment it hit Alameda's wallet, it was actually sent directly back to FDX. And that was a big rabbit hole that I found myself in, because I was trying to find other transactions that fit that category, and I really couldn't.
00:29:08.454 - 00:29:52.414, Speaker C: It was very unusual in the history of FTT. It was, you know, the biggest FTT transfer that had ever happened at that point. And Sam Bankman Fried actually tweeted that they were doing some wallet reshuffling. He, you know, lied, saying that it was a normal operation. It wasn't. It was between two different entities, and it was a clear transfer of over $4 billion from Alameda to FTX. You couple that with the revelation that FTT was the largest position in FTX's balance sheet, and that starts looking like a bailout to me, or at least a level of paying back for something.
00:29:52.414 - 00:30:36.808, Speaker C: My hypothesis, that something was user funds that were sent to Alameda at some point, and now it's becoming clear that was over the course of 2021 and 2022, wasn't just large transactions that Alameda subsequently lost. And to try to repay for some of those losses, they were actually transferring the FTT back to FTX and saying, hey, at least you have this massive bag of FTT, which we now know is very liquid. And Sam was doing mark to market accounting, which is completely delusional. But that was another really fun rabbit hole that we found ourselves in.
00:30:36.896 - 00:30:38.044, Speaker A: Yeah, what a find.
00:30:39.464 - 00:31:10.164, Speaker D: It's really fascinating to hear how you went about investigating this. And I'm curious to know, Lucas, what some of the biggest frustrations were in this process of trying to use on chain data to fix, figure out what the heck is going on. I'm sure there are aspects in which on chain data just can only go so far in this process of your investigation with the entire coinmetrics team. What were some of the biggest frustrations when working with on chain data?
00:31:11.504 - 00:31:56.866, Speaker C: I think the biggest frustration wasn't really with the work, was with the findings. It was really realizing how much of a scam this was and how many risky protocols they interacted with, and really just seeing the funds from hundreds of thousands of users being sent so recklessly across all these transactions. It was really sad and frustrating. I think that the more we found about their degenerate behavior, the more frustrated we're getting. But there were also frustrations with. With the data itself. Right.
00:31:56.866 - 00:32:26.834, Speaker C: There are a lot of false positives that you encounter as you're. As you're doing these. There's a lot of information that is very damning that you really need to be careful with these labels. Like the address tags, they have varying degrees of certainty. Right. Because an address is labeled as elemeta, it doesn't necessarily mean that it belongs to Alameda. So we have to be very careful.
00:32:26.834 - 00:33:15.524, Speaker C: But in this transaction, specifically this four plus billion dollar transaction, we could say with confidence it was between Alameda and FTX, because Alameda, I believe that was the address that they had used for Nico. You know, they were on the cap table. The supply matched, and the FTX address was the actual deployer or owner of FTT, which is FTX. Someone within FTX has that key. So for this one, it was deterministic. For a lot of the other ones, you know, we had to be very careful and diligent when it comes to assigning those tags. But dealing with the false positives was not an easy task, especially in building the story of what happened.
00:33:15.984 - 00:33:45.444, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm sure. And during this FTX fallout, I feel like everyone suddenly became an on chain data expert. Everyone suddenly was talking about what they were seeing on Etherscan and hearing the way that you guys were going about it. There are times when there's false beliefs, positives, there are pitfalls you have to watch out for. Were you seeing any kind of, like, wrong analysis on Twitter that was trending? I mean, was there? Yeah. And triggering.
00:33:47.024 - 00:34:10.804, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, there were so many bad takes and just. Just mistakes. Right. Like you said, everyone became chain expert, and you could kind of see the challenges with dealing with on chain. Right. Even folks that think they know what they're talking about, you know, might fall prey to.
00:34:10.804 - 00:34:42.384, Speaker C: You know, to give you an example, I can call any. I can deploy an ERC 20 token in five minutes and maybe, maybe less, but I can call that token anything that I want. ERC 20 spoofing is a thing. It's used to scam people all the time. I can call that token, you know, USDC. I can call that token FTT, and I can mint any arbitrarily large amount of these tokens. I created a token etherscan will still showcase.
00:34:42.384 - 00:35:30.794, Speaker C: It will read the metadata associated with this token. It will tell users, what is the name of this token? And there were a lot of folks that were doing this and spoofing transactions. This is called DRC 20 spoofing. And folks going crazy on Twitter saying, look, look what's happening. Like the hacker is sending all this USDT or binance is next. Or so many really, really bad takes on the basis of information that they were just manipulated and they just weren't able to filter through. So that was also kind of revealing in terms of where we really are when it comes to on chain analysis.
00:35:30.794 - 00:35:58.584, Speaker C: At times it's better not to say anything and try to really get to the point of reality and not try to speculate too much, because there are a lot of things that might be deceiving. And I think a lot of folks maybe kind of fools of themselves by preemptively just sharing just bad data. So that was interesting too.
00:36:01.724 - 00:36:03.344, Speaker D: Alex, I think you're muted.
00:36:05.284 - 00:36:35.524, Speaker A: I said not coinmetrics, though. You guys are consistently high quality and deliberate. What does it take though, Lucas, for coinmetrics to be so on top of these chains? I mean, this is all mostly ethereum analysis you guys were doing. But what about how hard is it to operate on other chains? All the data's got to be differently structured across all these chains. Just give us a little quick background on how complex and laborious it is to operate a multi chain data analysis firm.
00:36:36.544 - 00:37:19.354, Speaker C: Yeah, we do everything from the ground up, right? So we're running these nodes, we're building custom exporters to these nodes. We are parsing through these nodes, we are creating metrics around them. We're normalizing the data so that it becomes easier for analysts and data scientists to use. And there's a lot of work involved with that because not all blockchains are built for transparency. Transparency gets tossed around as a huge value proposition of all this. But some of these blockchains can be incredibly cumbersome to work with. One frustration for us was Solana.
00:37:19.354 - 00:38:06.014, Speaker C: So Solana, just to give some context, produces new data in one day. The amount of new data that it produces in one day is what bitcoin produces in one year. That's roughly 100gb of new data per day. And that is really, that really entails some challenges. First, running that node, we had to test different specs on that node. It was a trial and error process of getting the configurations of the actual hardware to be able to operate adequately. It was a very costly process.
00:38:06.014 - 00:38:41.296, Speaker C: There are all these crazy requirements around it. But even we've been running slantino for a really long time. But even running a node, which just wasn't enough because it produces so much data, the node forces you as a doesn't force you, but by default, it will start erasing old data. So transactions that might have been incredibly incriminating by Alameda within Solana, they simply just don't exist anymore for basically all type.
00:38:41.400 - 00:38:44.164, Speaker A: The vast majority of nodes are doing this right.
00:38:45.064 - 00:38:52.264, Speaker C: So many different nodes, they actively prune. This is called pruning. Even ethereum does that.
00:38:52.424 - 00:39:05.644, Speaker A: You can't do this if you're going to be building a giant archive and a data lake of this Solana data for you to peruse and for your customers to access, though. So you can't prune.
00:39:07.024 - 00:39:57.336, Speaker C: Yeah. If you want to index data and produce this type of insight into what happened, potential fraudulent or risky behavior that's happened a long time ago, it's just very challenging for you to do that with Solana and with several other blockchains that are structured similarly, and the tooling is just not out there. We're all as blockchain data companies trying to support Solana, but there are some unique challenges when it comes to it. You need to host that data using a distributed database. You need to use Google Cloud products and bigquery and some really novel data tools to be able to even index all of it. We had all of the data. It.
00:39:57.336 - 00:40:32.164, Speaker C: We decided to just focus on ethereum because it was really cumbersome to work with. I do think we'll get there. We'll get to the point where we'll be able to parse through the entire history. We have all of 2021, which is, I think, where a lot of that activity might have happened. So I do think we'll get there. It is incredibly challenging, especially if you're comparing it with nodes that we know and love. You know, bitcoin runs beautifully, and it really puts things into context in terms of the quality of the clients.
00:40:32.164 - 00:40:40.720, Speaker C: We just have these crazy blockchains that throw a wrench on our process every once in a while.
00:40:40.832 - 00:41:11.560, Speaker A: Hey, Lucas, just a couple more things before we wrap. You mentioned bitcoin here. There's been a really interesting. You've been a bitcoin analyst for years at this point. You're one of the brightest folks I know on bitcoin technology. What's going on with this debate about the RBF switch? So replace by fee is a mechanism by which you can bump your transaction once it's already in the mem pool. You can speed it up, replace it with a new transaction by paying a higher fee and tell us what's going on.
00:41:11.560 - 00:41:25.184, Speaker A: I see a lot of back and forth between protocol developers, analysts, and then also a lot of the payments companies in bitcoin. They're opposed to making RBF the default. Um, why is that? And what's the background here?
00:41:26.604 - 00:42:11.544, Speaker C: Yeah, it's. It's interesting that you see the separation of powers in bitcoin, um, especially when it comes to things that are as controversial as. As, uh, fee bumping and RBF. So, just a little bit of context. So, RBF stands for, uh, replaced by fee. It is a mechanism that you can basically increase the fees that you're paying with a transaction by simply rebroadcasting that transaction. So, in the unprocessed transactions that every node has to hold of users that have broadcast transactions, but those transactions have not made their way into the blockchain just yet, they have to index all those transactions in the mempool.
00:42:11.544 - 00:43:20.274, Speaker C: And RBF has been criticized over time because it does entail some inefficiencies. There are potential attack vectors that emerge via the structure of RBF. And there's another way that you can actually increase transaction fees, which is the child pays for parents mechanism, which is another transaction that you broadcast that, you know, tells, okay, my parents, this transaction that's stuck in a mempool because I underpay for fees, I'm paying for its transaction, too. And that expedites settlement. The challenge here is finding the optimal fee bumping mechanism and their trade offs involved with bo chop pays for parents and RBF. RBF can really pollute the mempool. It can entail some attack vectors that might require you to wait additional confirmations for a transaction to be final.
00:43:20.274 - 00:43:42.974, Speaker C: You can. It's also created a lot of fear and misconceptions within. Within bitcoin. I don't know if you guys remember this, but I believe this was back in 2020 or 2020 or 2019 when it was reported that there was a double spend on bitcoin. Yes, I remember.
00:43:43.394 - 00:43:49.134, Speaker A: BitMex ended up breaking this down for us, I think, pretty well. Johnny Beer there, but tell it.
00:43:50.114 - 00:44:36.284, Speaker C: Yeah, it was an RBF that was misinterpreted, because when you're doing an RBF, you can really change the outputs of your transaction and effectively change the composition of that transaction, the nature of that transaction. And that's exactly what happened in the case of this mislabeled double spend, to the point where people, they were freaking out, they thought there was a bug in bitcoin. They completely misunderstood how bitcoin worked. So it can be very confusing because especially for. If you're. If you don't have, like, a robust custody schema to handle rbfs. So payment providers, you know, they.
00:44:36.284 - 00:45:02.732, Speaker C: They don't tend to like child pays for parents, or at least, you know, some of the folks that I've talked to, they prefer RBF simpler, just rebroadcast a transaction. But there are these trade offs, right? You start clogging the mempool. The mempool where unprocessed transactions live, there's a cap of 300 megabytes, unless you actually manually reconfigure it and remove it.
00:45:02.908 - 00:45:23.960, Speaker A: So I'm very generous. I run like, a 600 megabyte mempool. Very generous with first storing them. But aren't a lot of the payments companies. It seems like some of the bitcoin payments companies, in some cases, you know, had missed, even misrepresented this fact. But. But even in other cases, just generally are.
00:45:23.960 - 00:45:26.656, Speaker A: They're basically relying on zero comp payments.
00:45:26.720 - 00:45:26.984, Speaker C: They're.
00:45:27.024 - 00:45:38.804, Speaker A: They're actually upset about changes here because they're crediting client accounts when stuff hits the mempool to make it seem faster. Right. But not when they're confirmed on chain. Is that. Is that what you're seeing?
00:45:39.824 - 00:46:13.318, Speaker C: Yeah. One, you should never accept a zero conf transaction, especially because of RBF, because I might send you a transaction, it might have the adequate fees, and it might get included in a block. I might rebroadcast a transaction and send the same. Create a whole new utexo that spends my. My coins and sends that to Christine. Depending on which transaction gets picked up, you're going to get credited. Alex or Christina is going to get credited.
00:46:13.318 - 00:46:51.852, Speaker C: So it's really bad for payment companies to make zero conf the norm. Even though we don't see reorgs to happen in bitcoin reorgs, they tend to be very shallow in bitcoin, one block deep, and they happen once a month, roughly speaking. So they can get away with doing this. But the attack vectors are there, and it. It's really bad practice if you want to, you know, be, you know, more risky. One confirmation at the very least.
00:46:51.948 - 00:46:53.572, Speaker A: Right? At least get it into a block.
00:46:53.708 - 00:47:11.324, Speaker C: Yeah, it's pretty, pretty insane. So we'll see how that unfolds. But it is one of those things that I don't think it's getting that ton of attention because it's very technical in nature, and I think there are a few folks that have strong opinions on it.
00:47:11.404 - 00:47:25.024, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's a lot of other stuff going on in the bitcoin and crypto ecosystem, news wise to focus on. Lucas, write us out here. Tell us what's up next for coin metrics and what are you guys really excited about?
00:47:25.804 - 00:48:00.608, Speaker C: So the saga will continue. I think this is not the end of FTX. There's a lot more to uncover. So, yeah, be on the lookout for new state of the networks. We have a free newsletter that you can subscribe to with all of the amazing insights that our team produces. So subscribe to state of the network to keep in touch. But there's some interesting developments that will this close once we have a lot more data around it.
00:48:00.608 - 00:48:04.712, Speaker C: But it is not the end of the FDS saga. That's, that's for sure.
00:48:04.808 - 00:48:16.044, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I love it. Thank you, Lucas Nutsy, the chieftain of chains, head of labs at Coinmetrics, our friend. What a great discussion and thanks for all your work.
00:48:16.624 - 00:48:18.204, Speaker C: Thank you guys for having me.
00:48:18.904 - 00:48:50.348, Speaker A: Quick break for our listeners. Our poll last week was, do you think Sam Bankman freed will testify before Congress? One third said yes, but a whopping two thirds said no. This week our polls also about FTX. No surprise there. The judge in the FTX bankruptcy case ruled that the names of unsecured creditors to the exchange will not be released for now. When will we learn the names of users or entities with assets stuck or lost at FTX? Before the hearing in January 23. Q.
00:48:50.348 - 00:49:08.100, Speaker A: One of next year. Q. Two of next year or later than that or never make your voice heard. Go to our Twitter profile, xyResearch, answer the poll and we'll get the results back to you next week. Now back to the show. We're back. I'm here still with our friend Christine Kim from Galaxy Research.
00:49:08.100 - 00:49:17.484, Speaker A: What a conversation with Lucas. I can't imagine the stuff that they do on a daily basis trying to decipher the these data and gain insights from it.
00:49:18.144 - 00:49:18.496, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:18.520 - 00:49:41.144, Speaker D: And it's not an easy job. Like hearing him talk about the difficulties of doing this across multiple chains. The amount of infrastructure you need, the amount of brainpower you need to parse through all of that. It's quite a feat. I think people have this misconception that just because blockchain data is transparent, it's easy to analyze. It's not two different ones.
00:49:41.484 - 00:50:15.782, Speaker A: You need entire research and development lab just to get great insights. And I will say, I mean, Coinmetrics has been at the forefront of the FTX unravel analysis, so great work from that team. We've been customers and users of coinmetrics for a long time, and I've always been very happy and a great team over there. So, Christine, you were the FTX bankruptcy. The first live hearing in this FTX bankruptcy happened on Tuesday. You were listening and watching live. They did this thing on Zoom for us, which I laughed.
00:50:15.782 - 00:50:32.194, Speaker A: They didn't use the webinar functionality. So like everyone, it was just like a million people on a zoom. Luckily, nobody interrupted or turned on their video that I saw. But what did we learn in this hearing? What stood out to you in general from the lawyers from FTX and the trustees that were there speaking?
00:50:33.174 - 00:51:56.714, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the most consequential decision from the hearing was this decision to redact the names and the addresses of FTX creditors, both large and small, at least in the interim period until court the proceedings continue on. Further, there was a lot of arguments to be shared on both sides, like the US trustee arguing that, you know, at the very least, we should be revealing the names of, like, the top 50 FDX creditors. And the judge did say that he would remain open to kind of revisiting this matter if it becomes, if it becomes clear that, you know, this is a necessary part of the hearings. And I think one of the other big consequential decisions was there's a lot of push to have these hearings happen sooner rather than later. So at the end of the first bankruptcy hearing, there was a motion to kind of schedule the second one for January. And this, there was a little bit of pushback on this, and now there's gonna be kind of an interim hearing before the one in January, actually in December. And so I think that was because, again, like, there's a lot of fallout that's still happening, and there's some core key decisions that need to be made just to give a lot more clarity and stability to the industry.
00:51:56.714 - 00:52:46.644, Speaker D: So I thought that was kind of interesting to see. And since it was the first hearing, there was just a lot of, like, procedural matters to get through most of the motions. There wasn't very much back and forth discussion. There wasn't any, like, new evidence presented in the hearing. It was all going over what had been written down by John Jay Ray in his filing and procedural matters, like, you know, we still want to be able to pay our current employees and new employees that we've hired to even, like, help FTX go through this bankruptcy. So, yeah, I mean, it was, I think those were the two biggest things, you know, the timing of the next hearings and then the decision to redact the names. And other than that, I think that was just a lot of procedural matters.
00:52:47.544 - 00:53:21.130, Speaker A: Yeah, there were some just like, you know, audio clips, you know, saying that, you know, their significant assets are lost or stolen. But we already knew that, to your point. Yeah. The redacted unsecured creditors was an interesting discussion. It is standard for these unsecured creditors to be named. And obviously the market in a bankruptcy filing proceeding, and obviously the market is waiting to see who is on that list. They did release on, I think, on Friday.
00:53:21.130 - 00:53:54.934, Speaker A: Maybe they filed it Friday. It didn't get published, I don't think, until Sunday. A list of the top 50 creditors and how much they have stuck on the exchange, quote, unquote, quote, or lost, but with no names. Right. So we knew that they range from 21 million in exposure at the 50th to 226 million at the number one spot. But we don't know who those are. And I think it's very hard for crypto market participants or analysts and researchers like ourselves to really assess the full fallout and contagion from this event at FTX without knowing that.
00:53:54.934 - 00:54:20.404, Speaker A: And so there is significant public demand and interest in knowing those. But on the other hand, I guess the argument from FTX was, we have millions of customers, and these customers are involved in digital bearer assets, and there are significant cybersecurity and personal safety risks to their information being released. Don't get me wrong. I definitely sympathize with that as well.
00:54:20.984 - 00:55:23.404, Speaker D: And the other point that the lawyers at Sullivan and Cromwell was making, which is the law firm that's representing all the FTX debtors, was that in the process of these hearings, as they bring forward evidence, some of those names will have to be revealed, and a lot of these names will be revealed in a voluntary manner. Like, people are going to have to come forward as witnesses. So even if the full list isn't revealed, like, what is necessary for these trials will be. So I think that'll be really important to watch. Like, I think the first hearing, we didn't, again, we didn't hear a lot of, like, new evidence around the FDX fallout. But I think the second hearing and the third hearing, it'll be interesting to see if the decision of the redactions gets reversed. But also, what are the names that are revealed in this process? And it's funny that you had mentioned in the beginning, Alex, that this was a Zoom meeting because there was a point in which the judge was like, okay, guys, we've been talking about this for like, an hour and a half.
00:55:23.404 - 00:55:41.144, Speaker D: Let's take a quick break. And it was at that point, the DJ's in the room just, like, revealed themselves, started to say very random words, and someone started to play the Justin Bieber song. Sorry. And everyone on the call was like, can you please shut up? And, like, could someone please mute participants?
00:55:41.444 - 00:55:42.100, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:55:42.132 - 00:55:46.108, Speaker D: There was a lot of, like, weird kind of activity like that.
00:55:46.276 - 00:56:14.504, Speaker A: We got to get these courts up into the 21st century. All right, Zoom has that functionality, folks. You can run a webinar where the listeners cannot participate. That's what it should have been. It also made it hard to actually watch because you had to manually pin the video of the court because it was showing you a grid of, like, you know, on one page, like, a hundred participants, all of whom were, you know, video off with one little, tiny one of the video, because there were, like, five or 600 people listening to that remotely. I saw.
00:56:15.524 - 00:56:36.088, Speaker D: Yeah, at one point, I counted 666 participants, and I was counting through the. The names to see if I could, like, you know, dox anyone, like, reveal anyone's, like, who else is listening in on the call? And I. I noticed that a lot of people had. Had probably just used, like, pseudonyms or something because they knew. It's a public Zoom call.
00:56:36.256 - 00:56:55.298, Speaker A: Yeah, there were some. There were some. I saw a couple, too, that were. I'm not gonna say them here, but, you know, even, like, you know, dirty joke names that I saw. It really was. It was huge news, though. The redacted creditor stuff is irregular in a bankruptcy filing proceeding, but I understand why.
00:56:55.298 - 00:57:31.732, Speaker A: But I would bet that we eventually do get a lot more information. But it's one of these things that's upsetting for market participants. We want to know who's at risk, not just us at galaxy, but everyone in general who participates in these markets. They want to know if their counterparties are at risk, if their customers are at risk, if they're whomever. We really do want that clarity, but it's a tough balance. I mean, I think one of the proposals I heard was, well, what if we were to release the names of the unsecured creditors? If they're entities and they're not individuals. Right.
00:57:31.732 - 00:58:08.472, Speaker A: And I think that that will happen and that should happen. I don't think there's any business entity that should be hidden here. They're not exposed in the same way that an individual's name, email address, phone number is in terms of phishing attacks and even the $5 wrench attack, or I should call it a $10 wrench attack these days because of inflation, which is real. I mean, that's a real risk. Right. This happened one of the hardware wallet manufacturers sales databases. So not like sensitive, like, you know, not like financial information, but the database where they email everyone, they have their names.
00:58:08.472 - 00:58:32.304, Speaker A: And if you had bought a hardware wallet on their website a couple years ago, it was hacked and leaked. And then those people are known by attackers to own digital bearer assets because they had bought hardware wallets. So they're a great target for phishing and scams. And people were texting those people saying, oh, hey, I'm from the hardware wallet company. Like, you know, by the way, we have an upgrade. You got to click this link right. And getting phished.
00:58:32.304 - 00:58:37.564, Speaker A: And so this type of info, who owns digital bearer assets is very sensitive though.
00:58:38.144 - 00:58:45.044, Speaker D: Yeah. Do you know what happened with the Celsius bankruptcy hearings? Like how they had handled customer information?
00:58:45.554 - 00:59:06.574, Speaker A: Yeah, they released it all publicly. It's very bad for, I believe even for small holders. They really, they published a giant list. I think that's good. That's normal, unfortunately. So maybe they can find a path forward. I like maybe entities and not individuals would be away, but bankruptcy proceedings by nature, they kind of occur inside a fishbowl.
00:59:06.574 - 00:59:37.080, Speaker A: It's supposed to be extremely transparent. And so it's an interesting tension here, to be honest. So the other thing that we've been watching a lot, and I know many of our listeners will have as well, is what's going on at Genesis and digital currency group. So I think was it last Wednesday, Gemini. Genesis halted redemptions from their lending book. And Genesis is. It's called Genesis Global Capital, maybe, which is the lending business.
00:59:37.080 - 01:00:29.212, Speaker A: They were the largest, historically the largest lender in crypto, centralized lender, and they halted redemptions and said there was a liquidity issue. And then Gemini earn, which is apparently a deposit bearing interest account for crypto assets operated by the Gemini Exchange, which is located in New York and regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. They had to halt redemptions because I guess they were using Genesis to help generate the yield that they were paying back to their depositors, which is, by the way, kind of crazy because Gemini earn is still operating. Coinbase got prohibited from offering this product by the SEC. Blockfi had to settle with the SEC and halt interest bearing deposit accounts in the US. Weren't these. I'm surprised that this was even still operating.
01:00:29.212 - 01:00:38.184, Speaker A: It seemed like the various us regulators and whatnot had put an end to these types of onshore interest bearing accounts. So that was surprising.
01:00:39.244 - 01:00:42.692, Speaker D: Their program might have been just far too small to really.
01:00:42.748 - 01:01:19.208, Speaker A: Yeah, it could have been under the radar. Or maybe it was only like accredited investors, for all we know. I mean, maybe it wasn't mom and pop retail. We actually just don't know. But anyway, the fallout from that has continued. Genesis, a key market player counterparty to many in the space, appears headed for bankruptcy, it looks like. I mean, I think on Tuesday it was reported that they had hired Molis, an investment bank, to help advise on possible, possible stuff, you know, including perhaps bankruptcy, although they said they.
01:01:19.208 - 01:02:24.704, Speaker A: That no bankruptcy filing was imminent. And then Barry Silbert, the CEO and founder of digital currency group, wrote a letter to investors yesterday that many shared online saying they were strong and that they're going to get through this and that they're working to get through it. And there's other details there. But he primarily detailed the strength of the DCG family of companies, which is grayscale, Genesis Foundry, Luno HQ and Coindesk. And it's honestly a big question. Everyone immediately got concerned, aside from any additional fallout that Genesis itself might create, was if this contagion goes up the chain to the. To the parent company, DCG, could that also imperil something like Grayscale? And that's a big question because Grayscale is the largest crypto asset asset manager on earth, with, I think, ten to 15 billion under management at this time, but at one point, well over 30.
01:02:24.704 - 01:02:59.324, Speaker A: And they're the operator of GBTC, the largest single bitcoin investment vehicle in the world. And so lots of people wondering about whether or not any kind of contagion could spread to grayscale. And what would that mean for GBTC? You heard bim. Net earlier on the podcast mentioned that we don't think that there's any real likelihood of redemptions being turned on at GBTC. The nature of that trust is such that it can only create shares. You cannot redeem them. It's kind of like hotel California, you know, like you can check in, but you can never leave.
01:02:59.324 - 01:03:22.964, Speaker A: And so we don't think that's likely for a variety of reasons, but also everyone trying to understand, like, the bankruptcy remoteness of a trust that is sponsored by a sub to a top co that could have problems. Right. Very complicated questions. Doesn't look like there's any imminent risk here, but the social media folks were up in arms worried about it.
01:03:23.654 - 01:03:49.954, Speaker D: Yeah, it sounds like the face of the entire industry is shifting and changing, and that key players, like you said, you said the biggest lender at one point, you know, the biggest asset manager. We're getting concerned about the stability of these players. I mean, who's left? Like, who's left standing and who is going to become the new face of the industry in the wake of this fallout, you think?
01:03:49.994 - 01:04:30.454, Speaker A: Alex, it's such a good question. I agree. As we get through the actual squall, I think that's where a lot of people's attention will turn, and not just from the, on the industry side, but I think it's fair to say on the protocol side, too. I mean, you start to, we start to put the 2020 to 2022 cycle, market cycle in the rearview mirror and you start to look at like, you know, all l one chains, you're like, are they going to last this one? I'm not. We won't throw shade at the moment on specific ones, I think. But, you know, and the same is true for, for market infrastructure players and counterparties in the space. I mean, I do think in one or two years it's going to, the big players are going to look a lot different.
01:04:30.454 - 01:04:52.124, Speaker A: Some we know a binance is going to be around. I think a coinbase is going to be around. I can assure our listeners a galaxy will be around. But there's a lot of stuff swirling around that's going to reshape this industry. Absolutely. And how regulation plays into that is also another question which could have a big impact on who the winners and losers are as well.
01:04:53.024 - 01:04:54.044, Speaker D: Definitely.
01:04:54.824 - 01:05:28.360, Speaker A: That's, I think that's all we got. I really enjoyed that interview with Lucas. I'm really happy we had him on. He's someone that, if you're in this industry a long time, you probably do know, but he's not, you know, the rightly so. He's not into the clout farming, clip bait social media game like many others are, so will probably be a new face and voice to most of our listeners. Hope you enjoyed Lucas and we'll have him back at some point in the future. As always, thank you Christine, my friend, for joining and your insights.
01:05:28.360 - 01:06:11.756, Speaker A: Thank you also to Bim net Abbi from Galaxy Digital trading. And like I said, thank you to Lucas Nutsy from coin Metrics, that's all we've got.
