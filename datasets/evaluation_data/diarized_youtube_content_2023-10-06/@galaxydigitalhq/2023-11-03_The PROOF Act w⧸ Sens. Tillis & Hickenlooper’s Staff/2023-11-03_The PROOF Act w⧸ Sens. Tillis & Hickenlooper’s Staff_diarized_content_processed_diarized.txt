Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. Ryan Adam from the office of Senator Tom Tillis and Naveen Parmar from Senator John Hickenlooper's office are here to talk with us about the proving reserves on others Funds act. The proof act. Fascinating bill that was introduced on a bipartisan basis in the US Senate that would help protect cryptocurrency users and consumers in the United States from commingling, would also require that exchanges and custodians perform cryptographic attestations of proofs of reserve.
00:01:42.466 - 00:02:17.494, Speaker A: Fascinating bill. It's a good discussion, of course, we'll also check with our good friend bimnadabeebee from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro before we get to that, and to remind you to please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. I am very excited about the proof act. I think it would take the space in a great direction. It's a narrow but powerful bill that would directly address the types of blow ups like FTX that plagued the industry last year. Can't wait to get to that discussion with Naveen and Ryan. But before that, let's hop right into it with Bimnet Abibi and talk about markets.
00:02:17.494 - 00:02:23.460, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:02:23.562 - 00:02:24.560, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:24.672 - 00:02:33.640, Speaker A: It's always great to have you on. And so we have a great time because you're on every week. This is a special week, like every couple are. Today is Fed day.
00:02:33.712 - 00:02:34.320, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:34.472 - 00:02:36.728, Speaker A: The Fed has announced what?
00:02:36.896 - 00:02:43.752, Speaker B: That they are keeping rates on hold. Rates are upset in the band of 525 to 550 right now.
00:02:43.808 - 00:02:47.724, Speaker A: Fair to say they announced nothing. But they said things. But they said things.
00:02:48.344 - 00:03:39.634, Speaker B: They released the, their statement as per usual. They kind of gave their rationale as to their decision and kind of gave an overview of what they're concerned about, what they're watching high level. They are seeing how financial conditions react to the tightening that we've had, particularly in the back end of the US interest rate curve. They're looking into how that's going to impact things like, you know, credit conditions and how that's going to impact, like, households. And so, you know, largely they're saying we're going to wait and see as to how things develop. And so you're seeing pretty muted price reaction to the statement. However, we are still waiting on the press conference that's going to happen in the next 15 minutes or so.
00:03:39.634 - 00:04:22.281, Speaker B: But, you know, and then we should get a little bit more additional context for as to, you know, the rationale. However, there's very little in terms of pricing, in terms of additional rate hikes for this year. And so a lot of participants are focused on cuts. And, yeah, it's an interesting day for the statement to come out because you did have a lot of data this morning in addition to the specifics around refunding came out. And so it looks like there's going to be less coupon paper. And the data this morning, particularly isms or ISM in particular, was really soft.
00:04:22.337 - 00:04:23.449, Speaker A: That's the manufacturing data.
00:04:23.521 - 00:04:38.305, Speaker B: That's the manufacturing data. Prices paid was soft, and so were new orders. So much so that the Atlanta GDP now tracker went from like mid twos in, like, forecasting GDP to, like, low ones.
00:04:38.369 - 00:04:38.761, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:04:38.817 - 00:05:05.974, Speaker B: And so. Cause new orders are like a big part of it, I believe. And so there is soft data, and we had less back end supply than the market was expecting today, all before a relatively benign FOMC statement. So you've had a pretty significant rally in us yields today. We've seen the two year yield take out 5%. We've seen tens go from 493, 494 at the highs to 480. Right now.
00:05:05.974 - 00:05:26.464, Speaker B: The dollar has been a little bit more bid than I would expect, given we've had a little bit of a risk on move in. Stocks and bonds are rallying, however, that may just be more eurocentric. And then the other thing to keep in mind is we had Boj earlier this week.
00:05:26.504 - 00:05:35.764, Speaker A: What did they do? I saw, is it yield curve control? It looked like there was. Because JPY USD was getting above 150 or dollar USD.
00:05:36.984 - 00:05:37.448, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:37.496 - 00:06:42.490, Speaker B: No, so basically they're stuck in between a rock and a hard place. That's a function of having easy monetary policy for better part of half a century, and you just can't get out of that instantaneously. And so what they did this week was say that the 1% band was really, in terms of the ten year was really more of a reference area, even though their official target for the tenure is still technically 0%. And so they're stuck between a rock and a hard place in the sense that, you know, if they don't materially address the bond market dynamics, their currency is going to devalue like crazy. And unless they're willing to defend it super aggressively, they either have to hike up rates and do a little bit more enhancement of the yield curve control, or it's just more status quo and they own all the paper in the economy, all the. The risk assets, and the currency continues to devalue. But high level.
00:06:42.490 - 00:07:19.938, Speaker B: It speaks to just the entire how disingenuous monetary policy is right now, whether it's domestic or abroad. These guys in the BOJ have literally transformed their economy in the sense that it's just built on zero interest rates and the BOJ endlessly expanding their balance sheet. If they started jacking up rates and bond prices started selling off, their banking system would be in trouble. Similar to the US. And then in the US, it's like, wait, they have a fiscal situation that has just come totally unhinged.
00:07:19.986 - 00:07:22.906, Speaker A: You don't think Powell's gonna address the fiscal situation in the.
00:07:22.970 - 00:07:24.178, Speaker B: No, not in effect.
00:07:24.266 - 00:07:24.810, Speaker A: He hasn't.
00:07:24.882 - 00:07:29.922, Speaker B: He hasn't. But like, what is he supposed to do? Like, he actually can't do anything about it.
00:07:29.978 - 00:07:31.322, Speaker A: It's literally outside his remit.
00:07:31.378 - 00:07:36.410, Speaker B: It is, but. And then if he's like, well, you know, the Fed's gonna have to monetize it at some point, then it's like.
00:07:36.442 - 00:07:45.750, Speaker A: Wait, like, I mean, he could also get called an activist or get politically targeted on it if he were to do this type of stuff. So it's tricky.
00:07:45.822 - 00:08:14.104, Speaker B: It's super tricky, but high level. It's like, there will be a moment of reckoning there, I think, eventually. But for me, it's just more like, I hate being lied to or deceived by my central bankers telling me, oh, everything's okay, we got it all managed. Right. Like, that didn't work out last time with telling me inflation is transitory. Right. And I think generally, there's just a lot of angst in the investor community and just people in general.
00:08:14.104 - 00:08:41.002, Speaker B: And, like, that's why, like, you know, an asset like bitcoin resonates with a lot of folks, whether it's the traditional macro types or whether it's the guy that can't afford a home because, you know, the fed jacked rates to zero and everybody bought all this property and all the wealth effects, all that jazz. It's like, there's a lot of disenfranchised folks out there. And so I think it's. I continue to remain constructive on bitcoin.
00:08:41.058 - 00:08:46.546, Speaker A: And bitcoin's over our shoulder, right. We're around 34 five. It's basically exactly where we were when we recorded last week.
00:08:46.610 - 00:09:14.730, Speaker B: I mean, it is, for all intents and purposes, at the tradable high in real size liquidity. I mean, 34,500, it is the best performing or one of the best performing assets of the year. And it's not by coincidence. You are having real size, real institutions like folks coming in and recognizing the value that's there. And it's highly differentiated. It's been uncorrelated to other risk assets as well. It's deeply liquid.
00:09:14.730 - 00:09:30.174, Speaker B: There are drivs. I mean, it's really having its moment. And obviously, the upcoming catalyst with the ETF, the bull case really writes itself. But to be honest, the bull case is made every day by these stupid central bankers. Every single day.
00:09:30.474 - 00:09:42.618, Speaker A: I mean, at least to your point, you've been more defensive of the central bank bankers in the past, but it seems like you're sort of. You're reaching a tip breaking point here.
00:09:42.746 - 00:10:15.474, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I've just generally just grown frustrated over time because it's just, it's like, wait, oh, we got to get involved in another conflict. What is that? And other conflicts involved cost money, costs money money you don't have money. You just print. And, like, if the dollar wasn't the reserve currency of the world, like, this wouldn't be happening. And there's no one in, well, there's very few folks in Congress that are like, hey, guys, we gotta spend a lot less. And I'm willing to take the political consequences of not spending it.
00:10:15.474 - 00:10:17.018, Speaker A: Is that a very difficult political, it's.
00:10:17.026 - 00:10:33.130, Speaker B: A political impossibility at this point. And so, you know, I think there's a handful of senators that talk about it. But really, in terms of, you know, rubber meets the road actions, you can't. And what President Trump, exactly what president's gonna get elected being like, I'm gonna raise your taxes and I'm a cut spending.
00:10:33.162 - 00:11:04.464, Speaker A: This is what I like about why couldn't, could the fed not, I mean, we talked about how they're in their own political conundrum because they only have this very clear mandate by law, by the way. Right. So if they were to start speaking out about fiscal, they could be accused of meddling in politics and that could hurt the fed overall. But they're not elected representatives in the same way that Congress members and senators are. So theoretically, like, they are in a position to be the, like, you know, the big kid in the room and offer a longer term view here.
00:11:04.504 - 00:11:28.938, Speaker B: But they haven't, I mean, let's just be honest. Like, boring economists on television doesn't sell. Like, people aren't going to turn on the tv to hear about, like, we got to get house in order and monetary and fiscal, like, that's just not like a popular thing. What do people want? They want checks in the mail. They want Social Security, the governor's safety. They want their potholes fixed and stuff. Right.
00:11:28.938 - 00:11:42.214, Speaker B: And they don't want to worry about walking down the street and getting attacked or whatever. It's national security. Right. And so, yeah, this is a bit wonky for them, but it's just like, you can't have everything you want, but, like, you can't have your cake and eat it, too.
00:11:42.254 - 00:11:45.558, Speaker A: We've never really learned that as a nation. Certainly not in generations.
00:11:45.726 - 00:11:46.174, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:11:46.214 - 00:11:51.654, Speaker A: There are many other nations where the general populace is very familiar with the ills that can befall you.
00:11:51.694 - 00:11:55.270, Speaker B: I mean, there are countries that really, like, you know, surpluses.
00:11:55.382 - 00:12:07.430, Speaker A: Yeah, well, and there are countries that have dealt with crippling inflation that actually blows up their entire economy and social order in their countries. And so those people are well aware of these types of issues. Americans really just aren't.
00:12:07.502 - 00:12:07.662, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:07.678 - 00:12:11.030, Speaker B: I mean, we're, Americans are inflation.
00:12:11.102 - 00:12:11.862, Speaker A: We're not there.
00:12:11.998 - 00:12:19.550, Speaker B: We didn't even understand inflation properly till, like, maybe even we still don't. I know, like, and so it's a very tricky dynamic.
00:12:19.582 - 00:12:39.574, Speaker A: We're not there at the, you know, the societal or economic blow up with inflation yet, but I think what we're talking about is the very long term national debt that's going to tie this country's hands in terms of what it can do fiscally because of the interest on that debt. And you've got the central bank really not speaking about that part of the equation.
00:12:39.994 - 00:12:46.898, Speaker B: And it's frustrating, but because it's not just about now, it's like five years from now, what does the profile look ten years from now, what does the profile look?
00:12:46.906 - 00:12:47.058, Speaker C: 10%.
00:12:47.066 - 00:12:47.858, Speaker A: We've seen some estimates.
00:12:47.906 - 00:12:51.250, Speaker B: It looks awful. And the estimates, you know, are badly.
00:12:51.362 - 00:13:07.450, Speaker A: Projections are not good. Well, maybe. Maybe if bitcoin becomes more popular, people will learn more about a scarce fix, commodity type money and that that will change some attitudes about and education about. About money and spending. That maybe that's asking a lot.
00:13:07.482 - 00:13:12.786, Speaker B: But, you know, I think asking the bare minimum because money isn't what it used to be.
00:13:12.850 - 00:13:15.506, Speaker A: Yep. Bimnet, abibi, galaxy trading. Thank you so much.
00:13:15.570 - 00:13:16.374, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:13:18.314 - 00:13:30.538, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guests, Ryan Adam and Naveen Parmar. Ryan Adam, economic policy advisor to Senator Tom Tillis and Naveen Parmar, chief counsel for Senator John Hickenlooper. Guys, thanks so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:13:30.626 - 00:13:34.490, Speaker D: Yeah. Alex, thank you for having us. This is Ryan Adam and greatly appreciate.
00:13:34.522 - 00:13:39.258, Speaker C: To be here, being here. Thanks. Thanks again for having us and looking forward to this discussion.
00:13:39.346 - 00:14:18.858, Speaker A: So we're going to get into it a little bit. And I have Ryan and Naveen here because their offices, Senator Tom Tillis and Senator John Hickenlooper, have introduced the proof act, the proving reserves of others Funds act, which mandates proof of reserves and auditing requirements on crypto custodians and exchanges in the United States. It's a super interesting piece of legislation that, of course, I'm supportive of. But before we do that, maybe we start with Ryan. Tell us who you are, how you got into your position. I think people are interested to know how people who work in Washington get there. And then, of course, tell us about Senator Tillis and his interest here in this bill.
00:14:18.946 - 00:14:41.050, Speaker D: Sure. No, happy to, Alex. Thank you for the question. So, yeah, Ryan Adam, originally from Raleigh, North Carolina. So representing the home state and working for my home state senator. Senator Tillis, economic policy advisor. I also serve as the minority staff director for the banking committee subcommittee on financial Institutions and Consumer Protection.
00:14:41.050 - 00:15:29.436, Speaker D: So in that capacity, I lead most of Senator Tillis efforts on banking committee. So anything that touches financial markets financial institutions, fintech, and then also do some broader budgetary work for the senator as well, too. Been with senator for about seven years now and certainly have enjoyed my time here. And working for Senator Tillis is a pretty fantastic opportunity because he is, I think, a very pragmatic member of the Senate, very pragmatic member of Congress, and someone that is prioritizing getting stuff done a lot of times and really is a pragmatic conservative. He often tells us about don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And I think that governs a lot of how we approach legislation through this office.
00:15:29.580 - 00:15:38.812, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks. Ryan and Naveen, same question to you. Just maybe quick background on you and how you got to the Senate and tell us about Senator John Hickenlooper from Colorado.
00:15:38.868 - 00:16:07.004, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to. Naveen Parmer. I'm the center's chief counsel. Like Ryan, I handle a policy portfolio that consists of tax, banking, financial services, small business, fintech. As one of the lawyers in our shop, I also handle things out of the Judiciary committee, which Senator Tillis also sits on. So things like immigration and voting rights, cannabis, etcetera. So wear a couple different hats for the senator.
00:16:07.004 - 00:16:51.078, Speaker C: Prior to joining Senator Hickenlooper, I was the general counsel for the committee on Small Business during the pandemic. So that was an interesting time, trying to keep small businesses open through the paycheck protection program. And a little bit about my boss. He used to be former mayor, former governor of Colorado, two term mayor, two term governor. He's a first term senator. I joined his senior team shortly after he was elected in the 2020 cycle. The senator, like Mister Tillis, as a former governor, as a former, like, executive, wants to get things done, wants to work across the aisle and with, with folks that he thinks he has some commonality with.
00:16:51.078 - 00:17:21.869, Speaker C: And senator Tills is one of those folks. And then the fit for myself and the senator was he wanted to focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. I think there's only a few things. The senators in general have a lot of things coming at them. You know, maybe sometimes pick two or three things to work on, and entrepreneurship and innovation are two things that are one thing that the senator wants to focus on. And that was my background. Working in small business policy seemed like a natural fit for him.
00:17:21.981 - 00:18:10.538, Speaker A: Thanks, Naveen. So I was thinking about, and I think our audience probably heard that Senator Tillis is a Republican from North Carolina, Senator Hickenlooper, a Democrat from Colorado. Neither of your offices that I'm aware of, and correct me if I'm wrong, have previously been involved in policy issues related to digital assets or the crypto economy, at least in terms, certainly in terms of introducing legislation. While several other offices in the Senate have been, and I remember that Senators Tillis and Hickenlooper had given a speech at the BPC earlier this year, and they spoke about the deal making caucus in the Senate and their interest on focusing on singles and doubles. From a policy perspective, how does that deal making philosophy inspire or influence your office's interest in working together on this proof of reserves issue? Maybe. Naveen, I'll kick it to you first.
00:18:10.666 - 00:19:32.414, Speaker C: Sure. You know, it kind of goes back to some of the things that I mentioned earlier. The senator wants to get things done, just the nature of the Senate, because of the way the rules are structured, you have to get 60 votes to get anything done or across the finish line. So that sort of relationship building and that ability to see different points of view and want to work across the aisle just sort of has to be a fundamentally part of, like, if you want to get things done in the Senate and legislate. So that combined with my boss's inclination to support innovation, support like, new ideas and to support the entrepreneurship economy, I think that's what we're part of the financial innovation caucus. I think that just from my background and the senator's background as well, he's a former small business owner. He's familiar with traditional finance and traditional access to capital and some of the struggles that some people face accessing traditional capital, I think that's part of the reason why he's interested in this space is because unlike many industries, like technology or aviation or what have you, I think the financial services industry has been lacking in innovation.
00:19:32.414 - 00:19:58.350, Speaker C: I think this sort of the same products and the same players over the course of 50, 60, 75, 100 years, and that sort of disruption might be needed in this industry. And I think that's one of the reasons he found this interesting, or is finding the aspects of blockchain and, and innovation in the financial services industry interesting?
00:19:58.462 - 00:20:07.982, Speaker A: Ryan, what about you from the senator Tillis office? What about the deal making caucus discuss makes this seem like an interesting opportunity?
00:20:08.078 - 00:20:59.594, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it's a great question. I think Sandra Tillis and Senator Hickenlooper certainly been there as well, too, has been kind of at the forefront of a number of the major legislative pushes that Congress has made over the last couple years. And I think Senator Tillis certainly to kind of retreat back to what I said earlier with his comments about not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Well, looking for singles and doubles is kind of the legislative way in which you do that. And so certainly to your point, Alex, we haven't introduced other crypto related or other digital asset related pieces of legislation until the proof act. But that doesn't mean that Sandra Tillis wasn't part of the coalition of the willing that wanted to work on this issue. I think we can certainly get into a larger conversation about where that stands and where that's going.
00:20:59.594 - 00:21:24.938, Speaker D: But Sandra Tillis certainly thinks that some clear rules of the road are definitely necessary for the digital assets industry. And we objectively saw the proof act as a good first step into that area. That was something that is easy to understand and industry best practice, and certainly something that we think just incrementally moves the ball forward in a productive way.
00:21:25.026 - 00:21:55.956, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, can we just talk a little bit about. Because I see that this is a single and double kind of play, right. It's narrowly focused, I think, from, you know, I'll describe it as if I look at some of the larger comprehensive packages that have been proposed in both the Senate and the House. This is significantly more tailored, you know, just to build on that. Ryan, what about this? Like, what was the strategy there? Why is this interesting, as opposed to, say, signing on to, not that the others aren't, but like, why this also, why the proof act also?
00:21:56.100 - 00:21:56.716, Speaker C: Sure.
00:21:56.860 - 00:22:44.434, Speaker D: I think that's a great question as well. And it really kind of boils down to, on our end, we saw a very acute instance occur with FTX and the implosion of FTX, where there were a number of misgovernance and malfeasance actions that occurred there, that if you took something such as the proof act, would pretty readily address that. With FTX, you saw that they were comingling institutional and customer funds, and with FTX, you saw that they were diverting customer funds to subsidiary, which was Alameda research. And I think Sandra Tillis is a big fan of taking something that is happening, a real world event, and trying to craft a solution to that. I think that's certainly something that Senator Hickenlooper brings to the table as well, too, in his approach.
00:22:44.804 - 00:22:51.036, Speaker A: Yeah, Naveen, maybe build on that and tell us also, what is the proof act, if you can start throwing that in at the end of this?
00:22:51.100 - 00:24:01.034, Speaker C: The proof act just simply says that crypto companies have to have the assets of their customers that they say they have. It's a pretty basic concept. It's a pretty basic in terms of traditional finance, the reason we got interested in this particular piece of legislation is we sort of looked at the traditional financial services industry and said there's things in the crypto industry that have flavors of that. And are there things, we sent a letter to SEC chair Gensler, I guess, about a year ago now, particularly specifically stating, are there things you can do? Are there things you can do right now that you don't need a legislative path for? That sort of mirror traditional finance and Sec rule 15 three, I believe, is a brokerage custodial. Custodial requirement rule. And we just thought that's something that can be imposed on or layered onto the crypto industry right now. So that was impetus for our joining this bill because we thought there's a similarities that should be taken into account right now.
00:24:01.894 - 00:24:26.830, Speaker A: Maybe start here with this question, too. What is the path forward? So the bill was introduced at this time. We're recording on, on Monday, was introduced last, I guess, a week, about a week and a half ago. I mean, just for this bill specifically, a bill like this, like, what are the next steps? I mean, is it a matter of talking with other members of the Senate and spreading the view of it, or where does this go from here?
00:24:26.942 - 00:25:17.814, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's part of the strategy, is opening up and having those conversations with other potentially interested members of the Senate. I mentioned earlier that it takes, you know, 60, 60 members or to get something across the finish line on the Senate side. Or at least it takes a lot of bipartisan work to get something across the finish line. So I think one thing we'll be doing is working with, with Ryan, I'm working with Team Tillis on socializing the bill with other banking members, socializing the bill with other, other senators. I mean, I will say that I think when we first started CR's or there's some research out there that bills generally take about eight to ten years to get signing into law from time of introduction to passing. So, like, this is one step in the process. But I think we're also looking for potential vehicles that are in the crypto space.
00:25:17.814 - 00:25:38.834, Speaker C: If a vehicle would move, then we would be looking to potentially attach it to that. That's just sort of how things happen in the Senate, where you got to find some sort of legislative pathway or, or train, as we, as we like to call it. And if there's a crypto sort of path for legislation, I think we'd be looking for an opportunity to add this to that.
00:25:40.094 - 00:25:40.446, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:40.470 - 00:26:41.578, Speaker D: And I just add on to that that, you know, I certainly think for Senator Tillis's perspective, for our perspective that, you know, it's important to have something out there with our name on it that we kind of have on the shelf ready for the crypto and digital assets industry writ large. There has been a lot of talk over recent years about a much more comprehensive package you've seen that come together to be introduced with Lumas Gillibrand. Some of the other stuff that's come out of the Ag committee jurisdiction, and a lot of how this institution works, similar to what Naveen said, is you get these large packages together and then this gives both of our bosses an opportunity to be part of that coalition of the willing that pushes something forward. And so certainly in our minds, would be a really strong addition to any sort of cryptocurrency or digital assets related package. And obviously gets our bosses involved in that negotiation as well, too, which was an important point.
00:26:41.746 - 00:27:02.722, Speaker A: Awesome. Let's step back for just a minute, and I want to understand where I think FTX has certainly raised the profile of crypto in Washington, obviously not for good reasons. Where does crypto, as a policy matter stack up against other matters Congress is facing, either in the broader economy or financial services, maybe specifically Ryan.
00:27:02.858 - 00:27:59.634, Speaker D: Sure, I could maybe start with the Senate banking committee perspective and we can expand from there, but obviously it's a hot button issue and it's something that's incredibly important. That said, there are a lot of other moving pieces in the financial markets right now that are also incredibly important. Important. I think that a lot of time and attention is being pulled away because of the Basel. Basel capital requirements. The holistic review by vice chair Barr at the Fed on capital levels within the US banking system, and other actions by the SEC as well, are kind of pulling away the ability and the bandwidth for members to address cryptocurrency and digital assets with a lot of the rulemaking and the pace of rulemaking coming out of the SEC. So from the banking committee perspective, I think I've yet to see indication that Chairman Brown may want to move something in this space.
00:27:59.634 - 00:28:16.532, Speaker D: That said, cryptocurrency and digital assets remains a pretty high priority for members of the House Financial services committee, and there may be some opportunity to negotiate something between the Senate and the House at some point. The future that includes at least some crypto related packages.
00:28:16.708 - 00:28:58.494, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I agree with everything Ryan was saying in terms of Senate banking's priorities. I think we mentioned that the last few weeks have been tough in terms of the Congress doing the basic blocking and tackling of the budget. So I think short term, those kind of things will still be at the forefront, budgetary issues, and then next year we're heading into an election cycle as well. So that sort of is a potential impediment as well. But I think there is an opportunity for if a package does come together, there's folks like my boss and Senator Tillis and other House financial services members that care about this issue. And there's also another angle. There's a lot of folks, my boss is in this camp as well, really cares about consumer protection.
00:28:58.494 - 00:29:16.352, Speaker C: So once you have those sort of alignment of interests, where I think the proof act is something that creates some regulatory certainty for the industry, but also creates consumer protections. Once you have, my boss likes to talk about alignment of interests, and once you have those alignment of interests, there's a potential opportunity to do something.
00:29:16.488 - 00:30:10.314, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like from my look at and thinking about the proof act, that there is an alignment of interest that both industry looking for. First of all, a number of regulatory issues in the United States, clarity, standards. But also this is something that clearly is designed to combat some of the malfeasance we've seen from some industry players on a consumer protection and safety basis. So one thing I like about that, I think it's a nice way to describe it. Naveen, I'll start with you on this question. So some in the crypto industry have referred to how some of the market regulators, specifically the SEC, have, have pursued and involved themselves in the digital asset industry as regulation by enforcement. Would you agree with that criticism? Or also how important is it that Congress be heard on these policy matters in your mind?
00:30:11.414 - 00:30:54.696, Speaker C: We're actually on record on this. Right. The letter that we sent to Chairman Gensler outlined both those points, that there probably are spots where the SEC should be. There are probably outfits out there that are probably acting as they're treating assets like securities and acting like securities and financial entities, and they should be regulated. But there has to be a balance. And I think Congress has a role to create some, you know, create some rules and create some guidelines so that the industry can know exactly what is, you know, what is a security and what is not a security. I think that's exactly where someone like my boss and senator tell us our position.
00:30:54.696 - 00:31:25.048, Speaker C: Because to be like the voices of reason and not to be not a cheerleader on one side or the other, but try to be somewhat balanced in that approach. My boss was the governor of Colorado. Whenever we legalized cannabis, he was not supportive of that measure, but he saw it coming. The voters wanted, it seems like in the crypto industry, that the industry is here. It's a 1 trillion or $1.5 trillion industry in the US. So it's here and it needs to be regulated.
00:31:25.048 - 00:31:50.270, Speaker C: And I think he thinks about that in the same way as he viewed cannabis regulation. It wasn't something he was for, but this is something that is required of public policymakers to sometimes put their big boy pants on and deal with industries or create rules and regulations for something that you may not agree with, but you also understand there's a market for it and you need to create some clear guidelines.
00:31:50.382 - 00:33:17.552, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that those are great points by Naveen, and I think Senator Tillis would echo a lot of the same sentiment. Sentiments. At the end of the day, we as Republicans in this office, I think, have been pretty concerned with a lot of the actions taken by the SEC. We see them acting even not so much as regulation by enforcement, but regulation through public example of a lot of digital asset institutions and companies. And while it's certainly right and correct for the SEC to go after bad actors in the system, trying to establish a regulatory construct where it's just one off actions against specific companies to then threaten other companies not to take similar actions, doesn't really establish any concrete or bright line rules of the road for companies to follow. And at the end of the day, I think with Sandra Tillis economic portfolio and how we try and think about legislation in this office, especially given the geopolitical implications going on around the world today, we want to make sure that the US remains at the forefront of financial institutions, the forefront of financial and capital markets, and obviously the forefront of financial innovation as well. And so it's really important for there to be clear rules of the road that Congress establishes that's going to incentivize companies to stay here or start here, as opposed to having any sort of brain drain or talent flight to other jurisdictions.
00:33:17.728 - 00:33:28.592, Speaker A: Last question. I'll start with you, Ryan. What would you say to our audience here in terms of advice on how to interact with Congress and congressional offices generally, but on this issue specifically?
00:33:28.728 - 00:33:29.048, Speaker B: Sure.
00:33:29.096 - 00:34:29.226, Speaker D: No, it's a good question. And I think Naveen kind of alluded to it a little bit earlier when he talked about the research that it takes average of eight to ten years to get something passed. Proof of reserves is a fairly niche topic, fairly niche concept. And I think to the extent that listeners and yourselves can continue to educate members that this solution is out there there, that this solution is already an industry best practice and standard that can apply to instances of malfeasance like we saw with FTX would be very important members to have a lot that are thrown at them, not only in the banking and financial services space, but with all the other issues that are on their plate. And it takes a while to get traction on some of these things. But that's not to say that it isn't important to continue to educate folks on it. So I think that would be my primary advice, is just continue to beat the drum for this support for our bill.
00:34:29.370 - 00:35:04.594, Speaker C: It would be much appreciated. I think the sort of grassroots advocacy is really, really important. I think folks outside of DC maybe think that their voices are not heard whenever they come to Capitol Hill or whenever they interact with lawmakers. I can tell you from across the political spectrum, whether it's conservative or democrat or liberal progressive, they listen to constituents and they listen to people that take the time to voice their opinion. So I would say two things. Keep doing that. Keep educating, keep advocating.
00:35:04.594 - 00:35:44.528, Speaker C: And I would suggest also potentially doing it in a way that is focusing on the policy and sticking to the facts. And I say this as someone who's worked in a, in political entities for the last, probably 15 years of my life. Like, try not to over politicize or potentially or strive to depoliticize some of the messaging. And not that I think I've seen some of that in sort of the space. I think that helps sort of legitimize the industry where you can just focus on the facts and focus on the policy. And that helps out people like Ryan and myself who are in the weeds on some of this stuff and helps out members who have literally 1000 of things on their plate at any given day.
