00:00:07.200 - 00:00:13.934, Speaker A: Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Great to see you here. You were on vacation last week. Yeah, we had a good stand in.
00:00:14.054 - 00:00:14.614, Speaker B: I know.
00:00:14.694 - 00:00:18.262, Speaker A: Not a bad guy to have it. How's it going?
00:00:18.358 - 00:00:20.302, Speaker B: It's going great. It's going great. How are you doing?
00:00:20.358 - 00:00:23.686, Speaker A: I'm good. It's been a bit of a rocky ride.
00:00:23.790 - 00:00:24.206, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:24.270 - 00:00:36.636, Speaker A: The last few weeks in crypto, I guess, in all markets. But, you know, we've already talked about the bank runs and crises, which, you know, I guess we. I don't know if we can say it's abated, but it's now at a low simmer.
00:00:36.780 - 00:01:20.834, Speaker B: It's at a low simmer. But what I would say is that, one, it's still a point of conversation across basically every boardroom and kitchen table in the sense that bank rates are incredibly low and treasuries are incredibly compelling in the context of bank rates. And two, the safety around regional banks is still under question. And the third thing I'd like to highlight is that most people are like, oh, this stuff is abating. And they're looking at data that is really old. The Fed's discount window usage data and the facility data normally is on a one week lag. And so the data we have now.
00:01:20.834 - 00:02:06.510, Speaker B: And this is what date is it today? March 30 or something? Yeah, it's 9th and pretty sure it only covers the 15th or something like that. So people understanding of how much usage of these facilities is lagged, I think you're probably still at the point where usage is likely to increase. I think the clear implications of what's likely to happen are pretty clear. One, bank rates are probably going to have to get more competitive. Your JPMorgans, boas, citigroups of the world, the large bulge bracket, gsibs of the world are going to have to raise rates to stay competitive. And even the regional guys, they are probably also going to have to raise rates to stay competitive.
00:02:06.582 - 00:02:07.382, Speaker A: Deposits. Right.
00:02:07.478 - 00:02:19.654, Speaker B: And they're probably going to lose deposits, and you're probably going to have a contraction in credit and lending, and that's going to reverberate throughout the economy and the impacts are yet to be felt.
00:02:19.774 - 00:02:23.554, Speaker A: So it's on the simmer, it's not abated, but it's ongoing.
00:02:23.854 - 00:02:24.558, Speaker B: Ongoing.
00:02:24.646 - 00:02:47.044, Speaker A: I will say, though, you had crypto, you had bitcoin. Obviously, we talked about this, performed very well the week, and we just apparently issues with the Wi Fi in here. But we're at like, as we speak, we're at 28 450 or so on bitcoin, which is almost at pre fed high, to be honest. Right. So we came off a lot after.
00:02:47.164 - 00:02:49.132, Speaker B: We'Re at the one year high or trend high?
00:02:49.188 - 00:02:57.828, Speaker A: Yeah, trend high. Yeah. And so we came off after Jay Powell was hawkish and they, and they raised and they signaled more raises. They didn't come out with a dovish hike. It was a hike.
00:02:57.996 - 00:03:00.972, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a hike. And they still told you their dots.
00:03:01.028 - 00:03:22.418, Speaker A: So then we dumped and then we came and then we came back and then this CFTC case against binance came out and we, I wouldn't say we dumped, but we'd bled lower into the 26s. But then overnight last night, we rallied back to trend high again. So it seems very resilient. Bitcoin and you know, and ETH obviously like, but bitcoin is the main marker here. Very resilient in the face of a lot of turmoil.
00:03:22.546 - 00:04:00.470, Speaker B: Incredibly resilient. The technicals are super strong right now. When you see price action like this, I mean, we're on track to post a bullish outside month or what's known as an outside reversal. Technically what that speaks to is you set a lower low than the prior month and yet you're going to close above the high of the previous month and you're coming from a pretty low base. And this is going to be the third month in a row where it's up. And so it strongly suggests trend continuation. And we know that twenty eight k, twenty eight four is resistance.
00:04:00.470 - 00:04:09.734, Speaker B: So if you close above there, especially on quarter end, I mean, technically speaking, it looks incredible, incredibly constructive to the side.
00:04:09.854 - 00:04:12.458, Speaker A: Week, month, quarter, they all look nice.
00:04:12.566 - 00:04:37.930, Speaker B: Absolutely. Basically every meaningful dip this year has been bought. It speaks of a market that is under positioned and feels like they don't have the upside. It trades like folks are short gamma in certain instances, which can further perpetuate a squeeze higher. The other sort of big picture macro thing that I'm keeping an eye on is gold. You're constantly testing two k. Now that is an all time high.
00:04:38.002 - 00:04:41.602, Speaker A: That's got a break, right? It's been testing it for weeks now, right?
00:04:41.778 - 00:05:04.618, Speaker B: It has. And I definitely think that the banking crisis and the flight to quality and the bidding treasuries, et cetera, has helped. But technically speaking, if you break through the highs that the gold is set, you will be in price discovery and folks will be talking about how underinvested they are to gold as it is breaking out to new all time highs. And what is bitcoin but digital gold.
00:05:04.706 - 00:05:08.434, Speaker A: Or could be many things, but a lot of people view it that way. I agree.
00:05:08.554 - 00:05:10.372, Speaker B: And that's my primary view of it.
00:05:10.498 - 00:05:15.800, Speaker A: Dollar, you've talked for a long time too about the, the bitcoin gold chart as one that you like, the ratio.
00:05:15.872 - 00:05:16.784, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:05:16.904 - 00:05:40.646, Speaker A: And yeah, I mean I think, I think it's very clear too. I mean you see a safe haven trade happening with gold. There's also the geopolitical stuff that is favor, favorable to gold. And I mean I don't know yet. I'm not saying that, you know, the nation states of the world or the sovereign, the sovereigns or anyone else is yet using bitcoin in that way, but they could and they, and they are using gold that way a lot right now.
00:05:40.710 - 00:05:41.198, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:05:41.246 - 00:05:48.766, Speaker A: Because you got this whole dynamic with Russia and China and Saudi and India and like none of whom really want dollars, Saudi's in bed with us still.
00:05:48.950 - 00:05:50.734, Speaker B: But they're, they have enough dollars.
00:05:50.814 - 00:05:53.558, Speaker A: They have plenty of dollars and they're quartering the Chinese pretty.
00:05:53.686 - 00:05:54.846, Speaker B: So absolutely.
00:05:54.950 - 00:06:01.462, Speaker A: There's a demand for a non dollar, you know, settled trade and perhaps other, you're not going to settle trade physically.
00:06:01.518 - 00:06:05.122, Speaker B: With gold, but there's a demand for dollar alternatives.
00:06:05.178 - 00:06:05.922, Speaker A: Right. Thank you.
00:06:06.018 - 00:07:00.770, Speaker B: And there's strong interest from global players to end the dollar dominance. Not necessarily to take it over with rubles, but the fact that the US can just print money infinitely gives it such a tremendous advantage over the world from a trade security from various perspectives. There's a lot of folks that are actively trying to move away from that. I think one of the key things about gold is that you actually have central banks that buy it, BBoC being a big one. But other central banks across the world, basically they print money on the side by gold and so there's a healthy demand for it. I think if you're looking at global asset allocators, they're probably underweight gold as well. Positioning oriented potential.
00:07:00.770 - 00:08:18.138, Speaker B: There's central bank oriented buying potential and then there's the technical break of two k or 2100 that likely going to get meaningful follow through. So I think there's a lot of constructive things at play. And then the other thing and my favorite thesis about gold or one of the reasons why I like it a lot is because of the price action over the past two years. If you think about where gold was at the start of the US tightening cycle and what the markets went through, Nasdaq plunging, bonds selling off like crazy, flash crashes in the pound, in the yen. We went through an incredible year of global macro markets and what did gold do from the start of 22 to end of 23, it was basically unchanged in one of the most historic years and markets ever. And that just shows you how strong of a store of value it is. And two, if it can withstand huge macro risk off, how is it really going to perform in huge macro risk on when the world realizes that you're going to be at low rates for a really long time and it's basically structurally impossible to get back to a higher rate regime.
00:08:18.138 - 00:08:29.274, Speaker B: And so I like gold and I want to protect myself against dollar debasement. And I think bitcoin is the better way to play it. But I definitely see gold doing well.
00:08:29.434 - 00:08:44.765, Speaker A: Let's talk about rates, because we had the 25 bip hike, we were joking here, and I think this is overheard on the street. In general, a lot of people thought it would either be a hawkish pause or a dovish hike. I think we actually got a pretty hawkish hike. I mean, a smaller hike.
00:08:44.789 - 00:08:46.237, Speaker B: I would say it's probably a hawkish hike.
00:08:46.285 - 00:09:01.553, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, and that's why markets reacted negatively but have rebounded. At least crypto has rebounded. But we were joking. Like, we look at where the sort of, what do they call, is it a futures market for rates that we look at the street where.
00:09:03.293 - 00:09:05.237, Speaker B: Fed funds sofas.
00:09:05.365 - 00:09:23.306, Speaker A: And this had, in the end, the market had come to an agreement. It was more likely than not going to be a 25 bps hike, which is where that ended. But what are they pricing now? And because it looks like the market is still sort of against the Fed on this, doing even cuts by as early as July. Right?
00:09:23.330 - 00:09:25.894, Speaker B: Is that what it looks like halfway through the year?
00:09:26.194 - 00:09:27.906, Speaker A: But the Fed is really signaling that.
00:09:27.970 - 00:09:51.724, Speaker B: They don't like cut through this year. Basically, the Fed's like we're going to take rates to like around 5%. 510 is where the dot plot had things. The terminal rates are currently priced at 491. Expect it to peak next meeting, basically. And then you have about another 50, 60 basis points of cuts price through this year. I think.
00:09:53.424 - 00:09:57.784, Speaker A: The market is currently kind of calling the Fed bluff. They're saying the Fed's bluffing.
00:09:57.864 - 00:09:58.464, Speaker B: Basically.
00:09:58.584 - 00:09:59.760, Speaker A: They're disagreeing with the Fed.
00:09:59.832 - 00:10:37.552, Speaker B: They're disagreeing with the Fed. And I think it's totally reasonable to disagree with the Fed, particularly in the context of what we know is going to be a very slow consumer in the back half of this year. And data that's probably going to slow. Again, we've talked about as student loans, you have to start repaying auto loans, the ballooning auto loan payments, the continual decline in savings balances and credit card balances going up. We know the back half of the year, I think, is going to be really slow data wise. I think the market is picking up on that. And the market's saying, Fed's going to see that data.
00:10:37.552 - 00:11:15.870, Speaker B: Fed's going to see owner's equivalent rent moving lower. They're going to react to that. They're going to react and the credit conditions are tightening, blah, blah, blah. At the same time, the market has to price in what kind of a cut? Because a cut can be 25 basis points, 50 basis points, or 100 or even 200. You have to probability weight what you think the first cut is going to be and when it's going to be. That leads to certain distortions in the pricing. But largely speaking, I think the biggest takeaway is that the right tail of rate risk has gone away from the market.
00:11:15.870 - 00:11:24.854, Speaker B: We're not in a world where we're feasibly taking rates up to 6% plus seven, eight. That right, tails impossible right now. Exactly.
00:11:24.894 - 00:11:25.046, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:25.070 - 00:11:35.008, Speaker B: Yeah. And so the idea that rates have peaked or expectations for terminal rates have peaked has fully set into the market. And I think that is, can the.
00:11:35.016 - 00:11:36.524, Speaker A: Market be wrong about this?
00:11:39.024 - 00:12:13.574, Speaker B: Potentially? The area where it could be wrong is one, it's twofold, right? The labor market is still tight as basically been in history, 3536 unemployment rate, nobody's losing jobs quite yet in a meaningful way. You get a spiraling wage pressures, et cetera. And that kind of takes inflation higher. The other is commodity complex. If crude oil for some reason went to $100 a barrel tomorrow, we'd have inflation issues again. And so, yeah, there are scenarios where inflation does tick up.
00:12:14.194 - 00:12:32.182, Speaker A: So basically, if inflation is high, it's stubborn, it becomes even bigger problem, let's say, then Powell's got to go Volcker and really smack us down. And then the right tail of higher rates really could rear its head. But outside of that, outside of that market, we're like there, we're chilling.
00:12:32.238 - 00:12:47.966, Speaker B: And generally speaking, you can ask if you asked me a year ago or right when we started the tightening cycle, when I think it'd be a great time to own bitcoin, I tell you, it's probably when the fed ends its.
00:12:47.990 - 00:12:49.574, Speaker A: Hiking cycle right when it goes stops.
00:12:49.734 - 00:13:16.026, Speaker B: Or just right before in and around there, right? Big picture of thinkers trying to think about this asset class from the perspective of where it's going to be a couple years down the line and in the kind of terminal state of monetary policy. And so right here, right now. And I'm looking at the end of US monetary tightening and the US looking at the real limits starts to look.
00:13:16.050 - 00:13:17.818, Speaker A: At it seriously and think about.
00:13:17.986 - 00:14:00.814, Speaker B: And the other thing while we're on bonds, it's so crazy. Bill Gross had this tweet the other day, Bond king, former bond king at Pimco. He's probably gone a little crazy now. But again, he spoke to one of the key points about the state of debt at the moment, that being you need more debt to just refinance the existing debt out there in the US. It's really tough for me. I understand bond markets really well, you know, running twin deficits and how those deficits gets financed by central banks, foreign parties, et cetera. And I have a solid appreciation for what money is and how it gets moved and stuff.
00:14:00.814 - 00:14:55.502, Speaker B: And my terminal state of monetary policy always gets me to, you want to be long gold, you want to be long bitcoin, you want to be long hard assets, because money is constantly being devalued. And I think there's a natural conclusion most people get to. But I think more and more as you get through this stage and people realize that it's bailouts, it's stimulus checks, it's student loan forgiveness in perpetuity forever. And rates aren't going up, and your bank account's not going to pay you money even though the rates are going up. And just how quickly money moves now, the ability to go from fiat to crypto or from one fiat location to another fiat location, you know, I think all of that is really gonna start, become self reinforcing and, you know, people are gonna become aware, but it's just a matter of time. Just a matter of time. I think.
00:14:55.598 - 00:14:58.854, Speaker A: Bimnet, abibi galaxy trading. Great to have you, as always, my friend.
