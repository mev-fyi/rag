00:00:00.160 - 00:00:22.038, Speaker A: First, you've got a pretty fascinating story how you got to working on crypto. You're a lawyer, you've worked in big law. You've done. Tell a little bit of that story. Yeah. I mean, so when I graduated law school, I basically, I think there's a quote from Bill Clinton that said he walked out of law school running for office. And that's what I wanted to do.
00:00:22.038 - 00:00:52.102, Speaker A: But I got some advice around the time that that's a terrible idea because, and probably it's because the game has changed. Right. When Bill Clinton was graduating law school, he was going to Arkansas and he was able to run an attorney general campaign and like a shoestring budget with no money. I'm getting out of law school, have no money, have no access to connections. No connections, no access to capital. And you need that apparently, as I learned running for office. So I did the big law thing.
00:00:52.102 - 00:00:59.334, Speaker A: I worked at Kirkland and Ellis, a big law firm, did mergers and acquisitions there. Loved it. It was great.
