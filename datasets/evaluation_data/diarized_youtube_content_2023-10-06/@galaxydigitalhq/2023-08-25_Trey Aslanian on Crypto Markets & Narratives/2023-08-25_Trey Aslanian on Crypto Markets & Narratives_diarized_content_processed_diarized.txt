00:00:07.080 - 00:00:24.982, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. Flying close to the sun, supernova when we burst I often drop flames and I flow with little devious. You're talking blockchains. Tell me how much is. It's DP's. Ha. Silly metrics get rejected.
00:00:24.982 - 00:00:51.286, Speaker A: You might know about your rights, but have you seen how strong my left is? Haters take the pain they have and outwardly projected hope your vision gets corrected for you. That image is reflected back. Bust a track and build a citadel in Zion disciples are my scions crumble pyramids like mayons. We're talking shop with my homie trade the lion. Let's build the future we deserve and not just one to spy on. As always, I'm your host, Alex Gorn, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains.
00:00:51.286 - 00:01:14.904, Speaker A: As I said, Trey Aslanion from Galaxy Digital trading. Trey of the House of the lion is our guest. He's a repeat guest. He is back to talk about interesting stuff that's happened in crypto over the last month or two. We'll talk about world coin and french tech and base and who knows what else. We'll also check in with our good friend Bibnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. Big Crash happened last week in crypto markets, and we'll get into it.
00:01:14.904 - 00:01:36.690, Speaker A: Before we get to all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. I love having Trey on the show. It's been a while since he's been here, so let's just dive right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnett Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, bim. Net. Great to see you.
00:01:36.762 - 00:01:38.106, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. How are you doing?
00:01:38.170 - 00:01:39.114, Speaker A: I'm good. How are you doing?
00:01:39.194 - 00:01:41.786, Speaker B: Yeah, hanging in there. It's the middle of August, you know.
00:01:41.850 - 00:01:53.786, Speaker A: That's what I was gonna say. Like, well, we've had a little bit of excitement, finally. We did, but it has. Overall, it feels like a long summer. Pretty. There's been lots of doldrums. I'm not sure what a doldrum is, but it's been.
00:01:53.786 - 00:01:56.210, Speaker A: But we had some. We had some volatility.
00:01:56.322 - 00:01:56.970, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:01:57.042 - 00:02:00.610, Speaker A: Last week, right after we recorded last Thursday.
00:02:00.802 - 00:02:34.090, Speaker B: It was ironic because we were talking about how volatility was low, and I was saying that it seemed reasonably justified. Obviously, that was wrong. But what we saw happen last week was a deterioration of market conditions in terms of liquidity, forced stopouts. In the middle of August. You had a pretty aggressive move lower down to 2016, six k. And it happened at, like, in the afternoon.
00:02:34.202 - 00:02:34.498, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:34.546 - 00:02:36.754, Speaker B: When, like, not many desks were on.
00:02:36.834 - 00:02:39.934, Speaker A: It was like four to 06:00 p.m. Or so on Thursday night.
00:02:40.274 - 00:02:46.466, Speaker B: And there's, you know, lots of forced liquidations into, you know, no liquidity. Basically, that's why we had that big move.
00:02:46.570 - 00:02:53.842, Speaker A: Yeah. I think we saw the largest and just been bitcoin, specifically the largest bitcoin liquidation event since FTX. Yeah.
00:02:53.978 - 00:02:57.482, Speaker B: So this is on the magnitude of, you know, FTX, three arrows.
00:02:57.578 - 00:02:58.122, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:58.258 - 00:03:09.298, Speaker B: So this was a very large liquidation event. Generally speaking, my approach to large liquidation events is they're normally good opportunities to fade the trend.
00:03:09.426 - 00:03:09.810, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:09.882 - 00:03:48.602, Speaker B: Basically, all of the forced selling has had to happen, or most of it. And most of the time, if you're on the other side of that trade, it tends to perform well just because people are just so scared at that time. And so if you can manage that anxiety, it's typically a good time to own assets, particularly alts. Alts tend to have the most exacerbated moves. And so in the liquid, alts in particular, you tend to get very aggressive bounces when they happen, just from a percentage standpoint, because of things we've spoken about before.
00:03:48.658 - 00:03:54.714, Speaker A: Basic facts. Lower liquidity. I love that he said manage the anxiety. Is that a large part of a trader's job?
00:03:54.754 - 00:03:59.010, Speaker B: Is that the part that's like 95% of it or not? 95%.
00:03:59.042 - 00:03:59.814, Speaker C: Yeah, I know.
00:04:00.794 - 00:04:12.954, Speaker A: So, but, and then the movie people were asking why? Right. And there were some weird headlines, but none of them really lined up. And. But to me, it felt just like we've had a deterioration of the broader investing landscape globally.
00:04:12.994 - 00:04:13.714, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:04:13.794 - 00:04:18.450, Speaker A: Yeah. What context would you put this? We'll call it the bitcoin crash that happened last week.
00:04:18.482 - 00:04:24.786, Speaker B: But I think broader markets were generally selling off pretty aggressively.
00:04:24.930 - 00:04:27.610, Speaker A: Couple weeks, even a couple weeks. Two, three weeks.
00:04:27.682 - 00:04:55.100, Speaker B: Right. It was asian equities. Because of the chinese deterioration, the bond market was selling off very aggressively, particularly in the back end, like everywhere. Nasdaq reacted S and P reacted like euro stocks reacted like hang. There was a global risk off move that occurred over the past couple of weeks. And we spoke about it last week. Higher us rates, lower bond prices, lower equities, and a stronger dollar.
00:04:55.100 - 00:05:01.558, Speaker B: These are all things symptomatic of a risk off move. And bitcoin was holding up okay.
00:05:01.606 - 00:05:01.982, Speaker A: That's what I mean.
00:05:01.998 - 00:05:02.782, Speaker B: It was coming into it.
00:05:02.798 - 00:05:13.494, Speaker A: It was strange. It was kind of like one of the last dominoes to fall. Usually crypto is one of the first. I feel like in a risk off. Yeah, it held up for weeks at 29. It was just sitting there at 29.
00:05:13.614 - 00:05:55.594, Speaker B: No, I mean, it just eventually, I think anecdotally, it seemed like you had a reasonable amount of positioning left in crypto, and so you're not close to year end, et cetera. But if you're a crypto fund, there's not really a compelling reason to be long aggressively at the moment. And we spoke about it. It's really like bitcoin is going to move on the ETF stuff. Once the ETF is actually in the market and the flows can actually happen in terms of how high bitcoin can get to. On just the hype of the ETF, we reached that pinnacle. I think we did already, which was 31.5.
00:05:55.594 - 00:06:11.686, Speaker B: And that's kind of your bar. And in terms of known buyers in the market right now, it's very few. It's microstrategy that has that publicly announced ongoing bitcoin program.
00:06:11.750 - 00:06:12.358, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:12.526 - 00:06:15.646, Speaker B: Other retail aggregators, retail aggregate and then tether.
00:06:15.750 - 00:06:16.394, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:17.494 - 00:06:27.950, Speaker A: There's a wallet that's basically like quarterly buying or whatever. Correct. Right. It's not that much. I agree. The narrative catalysts are pretty dry here. We got like some court cases to pay attention to.
00:06:27.950 - 00:06:55.470, Speaker A: The grayscale thing is so funny because everyone was convinced that this, including, I should say I wasn't convinced, but I was also part of this analysis of following the grayscale ruling is very likely to come out in August. But now it's so late in August that it's like, maybe it isn't August, maybe it's months from now. It could be. And even then, that's a weak catalyst, like a grayscale victory, doesn't actually mean that. Doesn't really mean that much in the scheme of things. So you're looking out at a landscape. Narrative landscape.
00:06:55.470 - 00:07:19.230, Speaker A: Pretty dry, I don't want to say bleak, but pretty dry of catalysts at the moment. I will say you start to approach the halving we are starting to get into. I think in a couple of months it'll be reasonable to start thinking about the halvings impact on bitcoin prices and cycles. But even that, really, you shouldn't be. Historically speaking, eight months out isn't like a major time. So, yeah, it's doldrums. It's a little bit of doldrums.
00:07:19.302 - 00:08:07.408, Speaker B: It's doldrums. And I think when you're in a world where there's aren't meant too many crypto specific catalysts, I do tend to think that crypto follows the broader market as a whole. And so my outlook for the broader market is very rates oriented. And I still am of the view that your risks are that inflation, there's the risk of reinflation, commodity prices might start to move higher. The US consumer is still strong and data is generally holding up. Okay, imagine the US economy right now can handle mortgage rates that are like seven, 8% just fine. We just had new home sales print 4% higher month on month.
00:08:07.456 - 00:08:07.864, Speaker A: That's wild.
00:08:07.904 - 00:08:08.928, Speaker B: And beat expectations.
00:08:08.976 - 00:08:10.920, Speaker A: Who is buying these homes at those rates?
00:08:11.032 - 00:08:13.136, Speaker B: Well, I mean a ton of people.
00:08:13.200 - 00:08:15.096, Speaker A: I think it's a lot. We were talking about a lot of cash buyers.
00:08:15.160 - 00:08:26.502, Speaker B: Cash buyers, absolutely. And it's just demographically a new family, right. They still need a home. They got to upgrade from an apartment. Well fair enough.
00:08:26.558 - 00:08:32.774, Speaker A: I don't know. Yeah, but yes, I'm saying you're right. That is a strong number. That 4% is a strong number.
00:08:32.854 - 00:08:53.548, Speaker B: It's super strong. And what you have to realize is that there's so many things that get impacted from a robust housing market, right. Like you buy a home, you need a plumber, electrician, construction. Right. The state and locality that gets the taxes from. From the home, right. There's just such a multiplier to the housing industry and it's still super strong.
00:08:53.548 - 00:08:58.108, Speaker B: And the story is simple. Nobody like the supply is tight because nobody wants to get out of their.
00:08:58.156 - 00:09:00.224, Speaker A: Low mortgage scarce asset, right.
00:09:00.604 - 00:09:04.780, Speaker B: And there's still buyers, right. And people still have a job.
00:09:04.812 - 00:09:24.576, Speaker A: Three. So theoretically what I mean the basics are pretty simple until there are not buyers, right. Or people become for sell or there's more supply, right. If they become for sellers or if the rest of the economy breaks down, people get unemployed off and stuff, they need to move to a cheaper home. Then you see a supply influx and that's objectively not happening right now.
00:09:24.600 - 00:09:24.968, Speaker B: It's not.
00:09:25.016 - 00:09:26.776, Speaker A: So we still have that strength.
00:09:26.960 - 00:09:48.698, Speaker B: And so that's why I think the US economy can handle higher interest rates. And this week we're actually going into Jackson Hole, which is happening. And the discussion is, part of the discussion at least is around neutral. What is the definition of r star neutral interest rates? Where is the baseline for the US going from?
00:09:48.746 - 00:09:50.738, Speaker A: Krugman finally came out and said, I.
00:09:50.746 - 00:09:51.914, Speaker B: Don'T believe that in Krugman.
00:09:51.994 - 00:09:57.242, Speaker A: I don't either. But he came out and said the Fed should target 3% instead of 2%.
00:09:57.418 - 00:10:01.174, Speaker B: That's actually very interesting given that he's a little more.
00:10:01.714 - 00:10:13.934, Speaker A: He's on the closer on the unity kind of side, more dovish that people are joking around. So 1% increase? No, dude, that's a 50% increase in the target, some people are pointing out.
00:10:14.994 - 00:10:16.218, Speaker B: But that's a big deal.
00:10:16.306 - 00:10:29.530, Speaker A: That is a big deal. So much that Krugman specifically is saying. And although he is influential, he's a New York Times columnist, he's got a large audience. But that would be a big deal if they did change the target. But we've talked about this before. Do you think. Let's say they change.
00:10:29.530 - 00:10:38.194, Speaker A: Would they ever even say they've changed? They would never say that because they would immediately get more inflation. Right. They can't admit it even if they kind of do. Soft target three.
00:10:38.274 - 00:10:59.104, Speaker B: No, it's a very hard thing to change, especially given that decades of monetary policy have been based on an r star, around 2%. And that's the construct of, like, academia, et cetera, right now is around 2%. And it's not just the same for the US. We're talking Europe, pretty global.
00:10:59.524 - 00:11:04.620, Speaker A: That's basically the global consensus for 2%. Decent amount of inflation. That's not too much, but it's good enough to.
00:11:04.652 - 00:11:06.224, Speaker B: Not too hot, not too cold.
00:11:08.004 - 00:11:08.984, Speaker A: Just. Right?
00:11:09.484 - 00:11:39.204, Speaker B: Yeah, basically. So it makes things challenging for them, but communication is such a tough thing for them because they have to worry about their credibility at the same time. But all in all, what I think it highlights is a level of uncertainty around inflation and rates that is really unprecedented. And that makes owning assets, particularly long duration assets that have exposure to this variability and inflation and policy much tougher.
00:11:39.334 - 00:11:39.624, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:39.664 - 00:11:52.496, Speaker B: Because if expectations for neutral are moving around, expectations for inflation moving around like this, it's just really tough to stomach, especially if you're in a 20 year bond. Which is why my favorite trade still is curved.
00:11:52.520 - 00:12:01.016, Speaker A: Steeper. Yep. Bimnat abibi from galaxy trading. My friend. Thank you so much. Pleasure. Let's go to our friend and our guest, Trey Aslanion.
00:12:01.016 - 00:12:05.320, Speaker A: Trey of the house of the lion from Galaxy digital trading. Trey, great to have you back on galaxy brains.
00:12:05.392 - 00:12:06.280, Speaker C: Likewise, my man.
00:12:06.352 - 00:12:14.856, Speaker A: I was just laughing because I love your last name. Right. We were just talking about this and it's people, really. I say tray of the house of the lion. Right? It's armenian for House of the lion.
00:12:14.920 - 00:12:15.480, Speaker C: It is.
00:12:15.592 - 00:12:22.776, Speaker A: It's Aslon from Lion and the Witch and the wardrobe. Right. The Narnia series is my favorite. King. Aslan means lion king.
00:12:22.840 - 00:12:27.352, Speaker C: Those movies came out when I was like young. We were all so pumped to go.
00:12:27.368 - 00:12:30.928, Speaker A: See them in the theaters. And you got a big family too. You have what, five brothers and sisters?
00:12:30.976 - 00:12:34.792, Speaker C: We got a squad. My dad's one of five and they all have a bunch of kids.
00:12:34.848 - 00:12:36.072, Speaker A: So tons of aslans out there.
00:12:36.088 - 00:12:38.872, Speaker C: There's like 21st cousins roaming around the.
00:12:38.928 - 00:12:41.432, Speaker A: Do you guys do like family reunions in general and stuff? Occasionally?
00:12:41.528 - 00:12:42.690, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, we party all the time.
00:12:42.792 - 00:12:43.718, Speaker A: Big, big family.
00:12:43.806 - 00:12:44.334, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:44.454 - 00:12:45.718, Speaker A: Everyone of the house of the lion.
00:12:45.766 - 00:12:47.222, Speaker C: And it's good cause we're all like around the same age.
00:12:47.278 - 00:12:49.174, Speaker A: I love that. Yeah, that must be fun.
00:12:49.294 - 00:12:54.006, Speaker C: I wish other people are like trickling back into New York, you know, post college. Like everyone went and did their own thing.
00:12:54.070 - 00:12:59.062, Speaker A: I love that. So now you got the. So it's the house of the lion is large and reuniting perpetually.
00:12:59.158 - 00:12:59.622, Speaker C: Yes.
00:12:59.718 - 00:13:38.640, Speaker A: Trey, welcome back. I love having Trey on. I think for longtime listeners of the show, I think you've been on at least two other times. So you may know Trey from those, but if you don't know Trey, he's been working at Galaxy almost the entire, maybe the entire time, pretty much, or almost close to galaxy's entire history. Trey runs our OTC trading desk and is well known in OTC crypto trading. So a lot of our listeners will know Trey maybe from his work. But I love to talk with Trey about crypto mumbo jumbo because as a person who's been trading these markets and operating a desk that trades these markets for years, Trey follows the news flow like I do as a junkie.
00:13:38.640 - 00:13:41.460, Speaker A: So it's been a while since we've chit chatted.
00:13:41.532 - 00:13:47.668, Speaker C: Yeah. I don't look at my phone screen time, but I suspect it would cause me to.
00:13:47.756 - 00:13:56.748, Speaker A: Trey's got a Twitter account that's like, you know, he's got like ten followers, but he follows like 5000 people. You can clearly tell he's like a hardcore crypto Twitter lurker.
00:13:56.836 - 00:13:57.584, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:13:58.244 - 00:14:11.112, Speaker A: Before we even start, I once, funny for a crypto trader, somebody asked you as a junior employee, you had, I remember a couple years ago and I was here, they said, well, what are you going to do with your bitcoin? What was your answer to them?
00:14:11.208 - 00:14:12.176, Speaker C: Give it to my kids.
00:14:12.280 - 00:14:33.232, Speaker A: Yeah. So I love this take because Trey loves bitcoin also, which I think is frankly kind of rare, at least in the public discourse. I think most people that love crypto also own and love bitcoin I think most people are bitcoiners, but for someone who really follows and trades crypto markets, like, you have a very long term bullish view on bitcoin.
00:14:33.368 - 00:14:46.792, Speaker C: It is my northern star. It's like where I anchor everything to, but it's the one thing that I know will work. I'm pretty sure the other stuff will work, and I'm very bullish on it for specific reasons. But bitcoin will work.
00:14:46.848 - 00:15:09.024, Speaker A: You're very confident. Yeah, I am too. Love to hear that. But that being said, let's dive into some other, what I said, mumbo jumbo. Jumbo the other parts of the crypto industry. One of the huge stories and things that's been happening in crypto and has captivated crypto, Twitter is this new app, friend tech. It's a social.
00:15:09.024 - 00:15:12.984, Speaker A: I don't know what it is. A social monetization app.
00:15:15.084 - 00:15:40.304, Speaker C: I look at it as more like a token gated discord like Telegram vibe, where I see the example, if you could have been Mrbeast's first subscriber, that subscriber is more valuable than his millionth. And the kind of bonding curve that they use reflects that. And, yeah, I mean, it kind of took the stigma away from paid groups in a sense. Right. You would get ragged on that pretty often.
00:15:40.384 - 00:15:42.896, Speaker A: Yeah. Like run a paid trading group or whatever.
00:15:42.960 - 00:15:58.576, Speaker C: Exactly. You know, I don't know how much we want to get into this. Too much. But we're seeing a big take off in like the, you know, the social media influencers from, you know, all across the Internet that you can imagine.
00:15:58.640 - 00:16:17.304, Speaker A: Yeah. So friendtech is what? It's an app. You link your Twitter account and then people can buy and sell keys to your chat, essentially. And the price of the. How does the pricing work? Cause you're not issuing them. The protocol's issuing them.
00:16:17.384 - 00:16:32.240, Speaker C: It's like a quadratic bonding curve. So when I buy a key to the Alex chat, Alex doesn't get that ETH. That ETH is, think about it as an amm, right? So if someone wanted to sell that share, they would sell it and get that ETH back.
00:16:32.272 - 00:16:34.552, Speaker A: It comes out of a pool or creates a pool for each user.
00:16:34.568 - 00:16:40.440, Speaker C: Exactly. Think about it. I think it's quadratic or it's something.
00:16:40.472 - 00:16:42.576, Speaker A: So basically some algorithm, the difference between.
00:16:42.600 - 00:16:44.696, Speaker C: The second follower and the 200th or.
00:16:44.760 - 00:16:45.924, Speaker A: The 200 can be significant.
00:16:46.304 - 00:16:52.406, Speaker C: And then 200th, it's like, as they get bigger. Yeah, obviously, like the next marginal.
00:16:52.550 - 00:17:15.606, Speaker A: And so the user is the. We'll talk about the account. Like, if you're buying and selling my keys. So me as the account, not the buyer and seller, although you also have to have your own if you're gonna participate. They also collect a portion of a trading fee. Right. So if you buy and sell my keys to my chat, then I think there's a tax that goes to the friendtech team.
00:17:15.710 - 00:17:16.146, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:16.230 - 00:17:19.734, Speaker A: And also a portion that gets delivered to the chat owner.
00:17:20.274 - 00:17:30.746, Speaker C: It's quite large. I think the number it can be. I saw it's 20% total. Total. Half to the team and half that is quite large to the greater they had.
00:17:30.810 - 00:17:43.094, Speaker A: I saw some of the big Twitter accounts that are on there have collected 2030 ETH in fees so far. Like Kobe and like, you know, but like you said before, there's some non crypto people starting to get interested.
00:17:43.132 - 00:17:43.668, Speaker C: That's gonna be in the key.
00:17:43.716 - 00:17:47.052, Speaker A: There's that guy from Faze, which is what the gaming team.
00:17:47.148 - 00:17:56.836, Speaker C: Yeah. I brought this up to my brothers, and I was like, oh, like a famous guy joined this crypto app. Like, who is it? I'm like, this guy Faze banks, and they're like, dog, how do you not know?
00:17:56.860 - 00:17:57.620, Speaker A: He's mega famous.
00:17:57.692 - 00:17:58.388, Speaker C: He's mega famous.
00:17:58.436 - 00:18:15.612, Speaker A: So it's like ninja. Yeah, back when ninja. I don't know if he still is, but I used to enjoy watching ninja play fortnite, so it's an interesting. You think this is like, people have tried this. There have been several past attempts at this with bit Clout. EVen Steemit was social media that had. It wasn't really the same.
00:18:15.612 - 00:18:17.364, Speaker A: It was more like a Reddit style thing.
00:18:17.404 - 00:18:37.124, Speaker C: But it feels like a Uniswap moment, and I might. And I know I'm kind of gassing it up a little bit. But the idea of Uniswap wasn't new. Right. Bancor did it. We had ether delta back in the day. Obviously, bit Clout was a giant scam, but their idea of a bonding curve was actually pretty good.
00:18:37.124 - 00:18:47.476, Speaker C: Good like that. That was the part that actually made sense to me. So it feels like these guys got the. So the UI is still a little bit buggy. Yeah, and that's. But that's the beauty of crypto, right?
00:18:47.500 - 00:18:50.584, Speaker A: Like, you're trying it in production, their official app.
00:18:51.044 - 00:18:53.740, Speaker C: Like, they already have alternative front ends for. I saw that.
00:18:53.812 - 00:19:08.134, Speaker A: Friends, mechs or whatever. Yeah, it's like a way better because it's on chain. Right? Like, you can build the a. But the other thing that I think was really interesting that they've done, which I think we'll actually see more of. And who knows if Apple and the Google Store or whatever start to take.
00:19:08.174 - 00:19:09.150, Speaker C: I know. Yeah.
00:19:09.342 - 00:19:13.110, Speaker A: This is called a PWA app. A progressive web app.
00:19:13.182 - 00:19:13.534, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:13.614 - 00:19:19.222, Speaker A: So you go to the site on your phone and then you press the little share button or whatever and you can add to home screen.
00:19:19.278 - 00:19:19.886, Speaker C: Yep.
00:19:20.030 - 00:19:44.250, Speaker A: But it's not just. I didn't realize this, but those added to home screens, I thought they were just like, you click it and it's like just a link to the website and it opens it in Safari. It doesn't. It opens it in its own little window type of thing. Some kind of new web app that works really well on mobile and it bypasses the App Stores. So there's no approval from Apple because as you know, Apple has been hostile to some crypto use cases. Right.
00:19:44.362 - 00:19:54.218, Speaker C: Yeah. And I worry that. I don't know, I worry that they might close it because if I'm Elon Musk and like, I'm beefing with Apple over these, like, payments, I would just fucking make Twitter that.
00:19:54.306 - 00:19:59.690, Speaker A: Yeah, you could definitely get around. Yeah. Maybe there's like a loophole from these. Yeah, there are some issues trade off.
00:19:59.722 - 00:20:01.698, Speaker C: Maybe it makes sense for smaller apps but not bigger apps.
00:20:01.746 - 00:20:27.098, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it makes me think. I know Damas, the not the sort of main iOS noster client was removed from the App Store. They had to go back to test flight because you could tip people's posts over lightning and call it zapping them. And the App Store was claiming that was like buying an in game item which violates their store if they don't get their 30% cut. And of course people were like, that's not buying an in game item, dude. It's tipping.
00:20:27.098 - 00:20:40.104, Speaker A: It's not like they're not buying anything. There's nothing being changing. But anyway, maybe they and others could become these progressive web apps. That was one of the. Probably the main things reason this thing has taken off is it was a pretty solid mobile first experience, 100%.
00:20:40.184 - 00:20:56.928, Speaker C: And this is why I know, like, it's a little bit off topic, but the Solana guys got a lot of shit for this. But we really do need our own phone. Like the Apple Monopoly. Like, and I respect the fuck out of Apple as a company. Like, they are like a. Generally in terms of our options, privacy preserving out of the other major ones.
00:20:57.016 - 00:20:59.832, Speaker A: And the iOS is awesome. I mean, it's been great for years.
00:20:59.888 - 00:21:01.960, Speaker C: But monopolies are not good for consumers.
00:21:01.992 - 00:21:20.704, Speaker A: And this is a public. We're building in a open source based public world. These tools. And to not be able to access them easily is very limiting. Right. And it puts a real cap on adoption of public blockchains if, like, you can't really use them well on your phone.
00:21:20.784 - 00:21:23.824, Speaker C: Everything's mobile these days. Yeah, you're irrelevant if you're not on mobile.
00:21:23.864 - 00:21:35.446, Speaker A: I agree, but I agree, I think. I mean, I'm not mention this, but not go deep on it, but there are regulatory pushbacks that have been happening to Apple and Google and these others and jurisdictions around the world.
00:21:35.510 - 00:21:37.454, Speaker C: Dude, in the UK, they're gonna take away.
00:21:37.534 - 00:21:37.982, Speaker A: I saw that.
00:21:38.038 - 00:21:38.790, Speaker C: The iMessage.
00:21:38.862 - 00:21:44.094, Speaker A: Yeah, because they. That was a little different, but similar. It's because they. The UK was passing a new surveillance law.
00:21:44.174 - 00:21:44.834, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:45.294 - 00:22:07.120, Speaker A: That would basically require Apple to hack their users messages. And rather than iMessages encrypted, rather than decrypt it or build a backdoor, they were just gonna shut off imessage for the whole country. Which, by the way, I support Apple's stance on that. That's a little different than the tax on the App Store and the gatekeeping. But back in the day, you could jailbreak your iPhone.
00:22:07.192 - 00:22:08.024, Speaker C: Oh, that was so sweet.
00:22:08.064 - 00:22:30.452, Speaker A: It was great. Cydia was one of the alt App Stores. But honestly, it's just, for a working regular person, it's just a, it's too hard, b, it's just not viable. You can't, obviously, it bricks the warranty on the phone and other stuff like that, but like, you just can't actually do that on an ongoing basis. You got to use the phone. You can't be required to hack into your phone just to use it.
00:22:30.588 - 00:22:42.900, Speaker C: And this is what scares me, is the free and open Internet. The global Internet is very much at risk. Obviously, China, they have their wall. You have Canada and the UK, supposedly.
00:22:43.012 - 00:22:58.598, Speaker A: You have GDPR related stuff. Yeah, no, we're building. It's the everywhere. It's a great firewall of everywhere. I mean, everyone wants their own piece of it. Both parties in the US have called for varieties of forms of censorship and crackdowns on big tech.
00:22:58.686 - 00:22:59.214, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:59.334 - 00:23:24.476, Speaker A: And I think personally, I think most people in the crypto sector believe this, that big tech does have too much power. That's partly why we're all trying to build stuff on an open Internet. That's obviously a key part of the web. Three thesis is sort of redecentralizing the web. But, yeah, the phones are a big barrier to that right now. And I agree. I mean, look, I think the saga, the Solana saga, is an interesting experiment for it.
00:23:24.476 - 00:23:31.504, Speaker A: I mean, and all right, let's talk about. So we talked about friend tech. I mean, you think it's gonna be big in general, this type of thing. If not this one, then another one.
00:23:32.844 - 00:23:38.484, Speaker C: It's so easy to onboard and right now, like celebrities, like take the free money.
00:23:38.564 - 00:23:39.836, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:23:39.860 - 00:23:44.260, Speaker C: So I. Super low barrier to entry because it's on the crypto rails enough.
00:23:44.292 - 00:23:49.716, Speaker A: To pay just to have a private chat with people. Like, dude, seems like is that enough utility?
00:23:49.740 - 00:23:54.980, Speaker C: I mean, I think only, onlyfans, they make almost like generally the creators.
00:23:55.052 - 00:23:55.412, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:55.468 - 00:23:57.364, Speaker C: Make way more on the messages really.
00:23:57.404 - 00:23:59.412, Speaker A: And subscription than on the other stuff they post.
00:23:59.468 - 00:24:02.028, Speaker C: Yeah, generally people, like, there are a lot of lonely people in this world.
00:24:02.076 - 00:24:02.524, Speaker A: I get it.
00:24:02.564 - 00:24:06.604, Speaker C: This is lonely plus, like, I mean, how many people are in like paid trading chats?
00:24:06.644 - 00:24:29.188, Speaker A: Like, I liked what you said about Twitter also that, like shouldn't they, like, why should they have this value outside the protocol, the Twitter app, like they could and they are starting to. Right. They're not doing the buying and selling the access to the accounts as tradable keys. They're doing the revenue sharing with the creators. I've started to see some big chunks, some big numbers.
00:24:29.316 - 00:24:30.024, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:30.604 - 00:25:01.062, Speaker A: So let's talk about Friendtech is a blockchain app. Technically it's not on a blockchain. It's on a roll up. It's on base. The optimism based roll up that Coinbase launched and operates, is this the op stack winning? Remember, Arbitrum was winning for a while in this optimistic roll up world. This is getting a lot of play base. I saw Aave, I think is going to launch on base now too.
00:25:01.158 - 00:25:01.982, Speaker C: They launched yesterday.
00:25:02.038 - 00:25:04.254, Speaker A: They launched yesterday. What do you think?
00:25:04.294 - 00:25:40.542, Speaker C: Arbitrum is still very much the king of Defi on chain. They have your gmxs, all that good stuff they do consistently. I think it's right behind BNB in terms of Dex volume by chain. Optimism isn't close. And the traditional crypto only stuff hasn't really grown on optimism. They have the synthetix as their main thing, but the social fi, the gamefi, kind of like what you would have thought a couple years ago might have gotten built on like high throughput layer ones. That's what base is winning.
00:25:40.542 - 00:26:04.424, Speaker C: Right. So they have the friendtech stuff like that's just new. That's not like sucking in liquidity from, you know, wherever I'm playing zero sum games. They also, they had this hackathon that they did and something called like base 64. It's like some prediction market thing. So they're going after different segments, which I think is really interesting. You know, Coinbase, I think, had a very clear plan with this rollout.
00:26:04.424 - 00:26:07.980, Speaker C: And it wasn't just going to be a uniswap fork.
00:26:08.012 - 00:26:30.040, Speaker A: Abe fork, your typical classic try to vampire attack other. Well, because there's not much of a differentiating value prop there. But yes, if they have other types of apps, that can be interesting. Friendtech definitely won. I saw the chart's been going around. I think we published the chart in our newsletter maybe last week or the week before. I think daily active, or maybe it was daily active users.
00:26:30.040 - 00:26:37.632, Speaker A: Some version of the user metric on base had exceeded all other optimist and arbitrum. So it's growing. There's a lot of users.
00:26:37.648 - 00:26:39.648, Speaker C: They did more transactions than Mainnet the last couple of days.
00:26:39.696 - 00:26:45.104, Speaker A: Wild. It's wild. What do you think about Coinbase launching its own l two? Is that.
00:26:45.184 - 00:26:46.264, Speaker C: It's pretty fucking awesome.
00:26:46.344 - 00:26:47.496, Speaker A: Is that interesting?
00:26:47.680 - 00:26:58.572, Speaker C: It's interesting because, I mean, this is again, like, this was the Cosmos vision, right? This was the cosmos vision and it made a lot of sense to a lot of smart people.
00:26:58.668 - 00:27:07.668, Speaker A: Which is what, like commoditized layers, app chain tech. Yeah, app change and launching one. But you don't need necessarily one for each app. But it's like multiple chains.
00:27:07.756 - 00:27:08.124, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:27:08.164 - 00:27:09.748, Speaker A: Multiple versions of the same chain kind.
00:27:09.756 - 00:27:11.892, Speaker C: Of coming to that. Mainnet hub.
00:27:11.948 - 00:27:13.924, Speaker A: And this is the ethereum is the main net hub.
00:27:14.004 - 00:27:31.106, Speaker C: Now ethereum is the mainnet hub, not the Cosmos hub. And that's like everything in crypto is execution. They had the right idea and it always made sense to me. And I think that's why a lot of smart people liked cosmos for so long. But that's the beauty of being ethereum. If it's a good idea, you can just steal it.
00:27:31.250 - 00:27:35.090, Speaker A: World coins. Not on base, but they're on their ops. It's an op stack.
00:27:35.122 - 00:27:39.890, Speaker C: I think it's definitely op stack. I don't know if it's on the main op or they have their own.
00:27:39.922 - 00:27:43.064, Speaker A: I don't remember if it is. But it's also. It's on optimism either.
00:27:43.234 - 00:27:45.904, Speaker C: Well, they have one click deploy, right?
00:27:46.604 - 00:27:56.980, Speaker A: You're right. That's sort of the app chain. Vision here is blockchains of blockchains that all roll up to the same place. Instead of individual blockchains, they're now these roll ups that aggregate.
00:27:57.092 - 00:28:14.130, Speaker C: Avo is another one. It's like the old ribbon. They're doing an options exchange on the op stack, so a lot of. And they have token gating for nfts while they're in beta. So you get this blockchain right out the oven and you can tweak parameters as you see fit. It's awesome.
00:28:14.242 - 00:28:29.002, Speaker A: It really is that cosmos vision, actually, which was always a smart thing. That's why a lot of the crypto world has always loved the cosmos idea. It just never really worked. Well, it has worked, but it never got huge. And there's reasons for that. We won't delve into that. It's beyond the scope of our conversation.
00:28:29.002 - 00:28:48.174, Speaker A: I mentioned Worldcoin, so we'll move on from base and friend tech, which is still interesting, but Worldcoin is kind of, I guess, been a couple weeks, but they launched, like, what, a month ago or so. Do you have any thoughts on world coin in general, either on the idea or the. Whatever it is?
00:28:48.334 - 00:28:58.302, Speaker C: Yeah. First of all, having biometric data as your username is a really bad idea because you can't change your username.
00:28:58.358 - 00:28:59.398, Speaker A: Right? Right.
00:28:59.486 - 00:29:00.062, Speaker C: Or your password.
00:29:00.118 - 00:29:06.458, Speaker A: Well, if somebody acquires my eyeball scan, I can't change my. Right. You can't rotate your keys.
00:29:06.546 - 00:29:22.178, Speaker C: I never want. The easiest way for someone to get my money is to stick something from my eyeball. That's what I want to avoid. I mean, listen, it's not, like, a laughable idea. A lot of smart people in crypto want to bring identity on chain. I personally just. I don't see the point.
00:29:22.266 - 00:29:37.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't. I don't either. Now, we got. One of my teammates is writing a white paper on crypto and identity. So we'll have probably a smarter, certainly a smarter opinion than mine on it at some point from Galaxy research. But I agree. It kind of seems like a problem, a solution without a problem.
00:29:37.314 - 00:30:00.874, Speaker A: Like, everyone's been talking about it. There have been many attempts at digital id, like, you know, and you could maybe in some places you really need it, but, like, is anyone having. I'm just not sure I understand what the reason is. Why do I need a digital id? You know, we've talked about. Mike Novogratz has talked about one example a lot, which is you go to a bar to prove you're over 21, you're not supposed to have to give over all your other info. Actually, they don't even need to know your age. It's really just a binary.
00:30:00.874 - 00:30:13.732, Speaker A: Like, is 21 or over or not? Okay, I can see that being a thing, but how many instances of a bouncer memorizing your home address and coming back and robbing you do we really have. You know what I mean?
00:30:13.788 - 00:30:26.676, Speaker C: Well, I agree in the sense that you shouldn't be needlessly giving away extra information. That said, this is one of those things that feels like a perk. I don't think it's a product. Yeah.
00:30:26.700 - 00:30:36.488, Speaker A: It's interesting. I think many people agree that the Cambridge analyticas and the other big data miners are perhaps misusing our personal info.
00:30:36.576 - 00:30:36.968, Speaker C: No.
00:30:37.056 - 00:30:50.960, Speaker A: Right. And so you would want more control over your personal identity. It's just not clear that any of these solutions give that. I mean, and Worldcoin isn't really that. It's. Right. They're using it for civil resistance.
00:30:50.960 - 00:30:54.672, Speaker A: They're trying to make it very difficult to just like farm the token, essentially.
00:30:54.728 - 00:30:55.140, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:55.232 - 00:30:56.348, Speaker A: And also to.
00:30:56.436 - 00:30:57.668, Speaker C: They want the money now.
00:30:57.796 - 00:31:18.716, Speaker A: Yeah. And they wanted widely distributed. They want to try to, rather than giving it to the first couple people that find out about it either. Bitcoin miners who, you know, the people on the cypherpunk mailing list, like, they got to mine it early. Right. Which I think is totally fair. Satoshi basically told anyone on earth who could have possibly cared at the time it was effectively free, or the ICO or the SA or the private investors and the set.
00:31:18.716 - 00:31:30.494, Speaker A: Right. Instead of those initial distribution methods, they said, what if we could figure out a way to put it in every individual unique person's hand on earth? I think intellectually that's an interesting idea. Right, from a distribution method.
00:31:30.954 - 00:31:38.570, Speaker C: I do. I do. And that's kind of like why the friendtech numbers are so popping is because you do have to link at Twitter.
00:31:38.642 - 00:31:39.042, Speaker A: Right?
00:31:39.138 - 00:31:47.142, Speaker C: And so, you know, those are, I mean, for the most part, right? Like, it's not just or, you know, it's not Tron transfers back and forth, right.
00:31:47.338 - 00:31:58.194, Speaker A: I mean, you can create fresh addresses and Twitter accounts, but they're not likely to be viable. They're not likely to earn you a lot of ETH on friendtech because.
00:31:59.934 - 00:32:00.246, Speaker C: It'S.
00:32:00.270 - 00:32:07.198, Speaker A: The reputation of the account. If you have no reputations, you're not gonna. There's no point in really sibling it. And you're right, there's that extra step to make it harder to Sibil.
00:32:07.246 - 00:32:28.594, Speaker C: And also in terms of distribution, I think that's a bad argument because. Right. Like something like bitcoin, like, yeah, there were a lot of early adopters that sold and that, like, that is like the markets, right? Like it's, it's gravity. Like, okay, everyone has this asset. Now I want stuff. New people come in, okay? I don't want this. I don't want money.
00:32:28.594 - 00:32:30.298, Speaker C: I want. I don't want stuff. I want this asset.
00:32:30.346 - 00:32:30.746, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:30.850 - 00:32:35.058, Speaker C: Eventually, if enough people find it useful? It'll disrupt enough, people will own it.
00:32:35.106 - 00:32:35.490, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:32:35.522 - 00:32:37.002, Speaker C: Like, people find a way.
00:32:37.058 - 00:32:58.154, Speaker A: I agree. And I don't like the. I'm broadly going to say I don't like worldcorn. I think if you followed me on Twitter, you've seen that I've talked, I've criticized it, but it's interesting, and it does go to that broader id question. And I don't really know what the supposed use of id on chain is. I agree. I think it's kind of like, I talk about this sometimes.
00:32:58.154 - 00:33:37.290, Speaker A: The Wall street crisis in the 1960s, there was something called the paperwork crisis. It was a huge boom in stock trading post war, but there was no net settlement, there was no central stock repository. So when you sold through your broker, let's say you sold 100 shares of widget and somebody else bought 50 shares of widget at a different brokerage firm. If I sold 100, if my firm sold my 100 to the other brokerage firm and their firm bought that 50 from my firm, should only have to net settle 50. But they had paper certificates and they had to do so. There's no bilateral netting. So you literally have careers currying around paper securities all around Wall street.
00:33:37.290 - 00:34:04.084, Speaker A: And they'd, of course, you know, slip and fall in mud and, like, get destroyed or get left on some dude's desk. And it got so bad. It's called the paperwork crisis. NYSE would close every day at noon, every Friday, Wednesday at noon. There was no afternoon trading on Wednesdays, just to give the brokerages time to catch up all the paperwork. It got so bad, 25% of all brokerage firms went out of business in the sixties because of this, because of back office. That's why the DTCC was created, that central repository.
00:34:04.084 - 00:34:37.720, Speaker A: My point is, if we had. I think if we had blockchain, we wanted to do it peer to peer, but we didn't have the tech to make it viable. So what do we do? We centralized. That's what has been being done in markets for efficiencies forever. You get significant efficiencies out of centralization, but you create central points of failure and trusted third parties, which are securities holes, security holes, as Nick Zabo says. So if only we'd had the tech, we certainly would have used it. The DTCC themselves, in like, 2015, wrote one of the seminal papers on blockchain, saying we should be disintermediated by this awesome blockchain tech.
00:34:37.720 - 00:34:57.934, Speaker A: They saw that and they were right. The problem is switching costs and all this stuff. So it hasn't happened I kind of think of ideas. A long way of saying, I think of ideas similar. If we'd had it when we started making our whole identity regime, I'm sure we would have used it. But now it's like we got dmvs and driver's licenses and stuff, and you got bankruptcy. Is it a ten x? You said it's a perk.
00:34:58.054 - 00:34:58.670, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:34:58.702 - 00:34:59.318, Speaker A: It's not a.
00:34:59.406 - 00:35:08.246, Speaker C: Exactly. It's not enough for the switching costs. There's something about having a personal information being physical also, that comforts.
00:35:08.270 - 00:35:28.306, Speaker A: That's kind of nice, too. It comforts me. All right, let's talk about the balancer vulnerability that was disclosed yesterday. So today's what, Wednesday, August 23? Yes, Wednesday, August 23. We're recording this. So on Tuesday, balancer, which is Defi protocol. Defi app, I should say.
00:35:28.306 - 00:35:42.546, Speaker A: Try to be precise with language. Protocols are layer ones or L2s. Applications that were built on them are apps. So a Defi app, first tell me what it does. I forget if it's lending or whatever it is, but they disclosed a significant vulnerability.
00:35:42.730 - 00:36:19.924, Speaker C: It's a more complicated uniswap. So you can have three things in a pool, four things, five things, different weightings. It's mostly things called boosted pools, where they, on an amm, you're providing liquidity from zero to infinity. And so they say, okay, we're only probably going to need this 20% range, and we're going to lend the rest out to aave or lend the rest out to whomever. And then all these things are atomic, so you can get it back in the same block if someone wants to trade. So I believe it was a lot in the boosted pools, but I haven't read the entire series.
00:36:19.964 - 00:36:40.364, Speaker A: Yeah, so there was something, some vulnerability, and my team looked into this. They said 4% of the total TvL, not a huge amount on balancer v two, was at risk, but they were praised for. Because this actually was uncovered earlier. And was it patched also, or. They're about to patch it, but they.
00:36:40.484 - 00:36:43.768, Speaker C: So the pools are, I believe, immutable.
00:36:43.956 - 00:37:21.304, Speaker A: So I think they're just advising people to pull out of those pools and make new ones or whatever. But they were praised on Twitter for having a really responsible disclosure. Really good comms around this. Apparently they disclosed enough to help people be safe and recover their stuff. Not so much that it was easily replicatable, timely. They dropped a list of all the affected pools right away and stuff. So, anyway, but it brings me to my question, which is, like, this year in particular, although in the totality ever since yams, there have been smart contract vulnerabilities and sometimes maliciously utilized by hackers.
00:37:21.304 - 00:37:37.336, Speaker A: But this continues to happen. And even this balancer vulnerability apparently was two years old. It wasn't recent, it was maybe recently discovered. Can it just seems like it just keeps happening over and over again. Can defy work? Is this like.
00:37:37.460 - 00:38:10.754, Speaker C: It can definitely work. I will say the more complicated you get, the higher the attack surface. Right. And anytime you're working with another protocol too, then you're inheriting all of their security risk. So I think something like uniswap, for example, that's something where I don't want to jinx anything, but it's very simple. It has had a lot of eyes on it. You feel like comfortable with that risk because it's simple.
00:38:10.754 - 00:38:30.190, Speaker C: I think you can use more primitives on uniswap. You can use some of the v three stuff for replicating options, payouts. I think that's going to be huge. You can take that building block, it's a simple thing, and then you can extrapolate out rather than building it all.
00:38:30.222 - 00:38:31.750, Speaker A: Into the app directly.
00:38:31.942 - 00:38:32.874, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:38:34.084 - 00:39:04.584, Speaker A: What I'm hearing is that, to my question, it can work. It works best if it's simpler. The other thing I've been thinking about with Defi is, because I love the concept, I want to do really as much as possible in my life in a self sovereign way, if I can. Like I said, they wanted to trade the stocks directly. They didn't want to have to build the intermediary, but they needed it. If we don't need it, like the intermediaries, I'd like that to the extent that's possible.
00:39:04.664 - 00:39:09.104, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, another simple, like, outside of uniswap is like all the lending stuff.
00:39:09.264 - 00:39:11.336, Speaker A: Like compound's been around compound.
00:39:11.360 - 00:39:33.072, Speaker C: Compound's been awesome. Aave has been awesome. Makerdao has been awesome. And that's one of the products that really works. The over the counter credit market has been pretty decimated post the events of 22. Yeah, that's like being used not just for yield farm. Like, the incentives are dried up and like, they still have billions and billions of dollars.
00:39:33.128 - 00:39:34.120, Speaker A: There's real utility there.
00:39:34.152 - 00:39:37.248, Speaker C: While treasury bills are yielding 2345.
00:39:37.296 - 00:39:37.928, Speaker A: That's a fair point.
00:39:38.016 - 00:39:40.200, Speaker C: Right. It has product market fit.
00:39:40.312 - 00:39:51.624, Speaker A: Right. The incentives, the new token, primarily new token issuance in 21 was driving tons of TvL coupled with the low tradfi rates, which were zero.
00:39:51.704 - 00:39:52.324, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:52.754 - 00:40:11.842, Speaker A: And so that's why that made sense. A lot of money found its way into defi to earn those yields you couldn't get elsewhere. But your point is, those yields, I mean, money market's paying 5%, so why would you put your. So they're not putting their capital there to earn yield. They don't need to go to defi for yield. And to your point, there really isn't much.
00:40:11.898 - 00:40:25.364, Speaker C: Yeah. Over collateralized loan. If you're a market maker and you can't get uncollateralized borrows anymore, or even collateralized for that matter, because inventory is so spread out, you go to defi.
00:40:25.484 - 00:40:45.596, Speaker A: Interesting. So this is the other thing I was gonna raise, is like, love it, love the concept. And while I used to criticize Defi a bit in 21, I said it was deep pocketed. Whales re hypothecating to each other. It was a lot of that. It's not really the case now, you've pointed out. It's got utility.
00:40:45.596 - 00:41:10.464, Speaker A: It really is being, to the extent it is being used, and obviously, the total volume activity is down a lot. But again, absent incentives from its peak, and a lot of those numbers were juiced at the time. But the guy from curve, the curve founder who had all this curve tokens, and he's borrowing off of him to pay for his life, makes sense. He didn't want to sell. He's long curve. He didn't want to sell him. So he's using Defi to borrow stables, aka dollars.
00:41:10.464 - 00:41:18.166, Speaker A: Wouldn't he have gone, though, to fidelity investments to borrow off his curve if he could have?
00:41:18.300 - 00:41:36.474, Speaker C: Yeah, it's good and bad. It's the accessibility of it, which makes it super awesome. And anyone can use the tough part. And this is all of crypto. This isn't just defi is if you breach your margin level, there's no, like, a phone call and like, give me my money by 09:00 a.m.. Tomorrow. It's like you're out.
00:41:36.514 - 00:41:40.254, Speaker A: Weren't they saying, unless you're on the BNB chain. Right.
00:41:41.794 - 00:41:43.314, Speaker C: If you get the protocol, the whitelist.
00:41:43.394 - 00:41:43.890, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:41:43.962 - 00:41:44.490, Speaker C: Liquidation.
00:41:44.562 - 00:42:03.064, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I hear you. I guess my point, though, is that it's not really competing with tradfi like that. I think a lot of people think the end goal of DeFi is it's just there are enough people with crypto native wealth, and they want to access financial services with it, and that's the only game in town.
00:42:03.404 - 00:42:03.812, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:03.868 - 00:42:30.814, Speaker A: And so it's not. It really is. It's secular, it's insular. It's not. I guess there is real world assets moving, like, trickling their way into it. But no one is like really saying, I guess maybe one of the main counterpoints here would be like uniswap versus coinbase. There are people who prefer to trade in DeFi rather than use CeFi, but I feel like it's mostly just financial services for token holders.
00:42:31.194 - 00:42:46.366, Speaker C: Totally agree. Well, people in the real world want to speculate on the biggest companies in the world, right? You look at what Makerdao is doing with their treasury, their real world asset stuff. Yeah. Like that's finding a way on chain because people want it on chain.
00:42:46.430 - 00:42:47.034, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:48.214 - 00:43:01.806, Speaker C: To your point, with the central repository, like, yeah, I would love for companies just to issue their stock directly on ethereum and we can all punt it around like we see fit. But, yeah, until, and to be frank with you, I'm not sure if we ever get there.
00:43:01.870 - 00:43:03.390, Speaker A: Right. Me neither.
00:43:03.422 - 00:43:07.234, Speaker C: How much it would be cool to take out a loan against my.
00:43:07.814 - 00:43:40.862, Speaker A: Yeah. And not have to call up the brokerage firm securities lending desk and do like. It'd be cool to do it directly if you could, or against a pool or in a peer to peer way. Okay, so let's keep going. A lot of the conversation we've had so far is really focuses all around the Ethereum ecosystem, right? And so I think if you take out Ethereum dominance again outside bitcoin, but against, it's in the smart contract blockchain world, which is basically everything. But bitcoin is inexorably rising. Right.
00:43:40.862 - 00:44:08.374, Speaker A: And we wrote a report called Ready Layer one in December 2021 called Ready Layer one, Ethereum and its smart contract competitors. And the thesis of that report was basically bitcoin's its own different thing. It's not in competition with ETH. It's like they have different goals. We'll set it aside. But inside this other major part, with the global computer type blockchains, it's really Ethereum's game to lose against these Alt L1 s. And doesn't it seem like we were right? Like the Alt L1 thesis seems pretty dead.
00:44:08.374 - 00:44:09.542, Speaker A: No, we were right.
00:44:09.558 - 00:44:19.116, Speaker C: I mean, we mentioned the cosmos thing earlier. I think Solana does some really cool things around their fee markets. And with 4844, like, we're gonna have a localized fee market for rollups.
00:44:19.180 - 00:44:19.404, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:19.444 - 00:44:29.676, Speaker C: Which, by the way, I don't think it's gonna take cost down that much because if you have ten x, the activity on the L2s and we have a new L2 spinning up every day, it's gonna be net neutral. But anyway.
00:44:29.740 - 00:44:30.340, Speaker A: Yeah, fair.
00:44:30.412 - 00:44:32.396, Speaker C: It's conceptually, it makes a ton of sense.
00:44:32.460 - 00:44:36.356, Speaker A: It's moving ethereum more in a roll up focused way.
00:44:36.500 - 00:44:49.866, Speaker C: Yeah, well, it's localized fee markets. Right. And Solana did that early on. I thought that was a really good engineering decision. And, you know, the Ethereum guys borrowed it and. Yeah, I think what's all they need to do, I think, when it comes to see what works and use it. Yeah.
00:44:49.970 - 00:45:06.266, Speaker A: And. But it does seem like l two season on ETH. We've actually seen some all l one s. I think Ceelo was one that has said this. They're actually planning to close their l one and or transition to an l two on ETH. Like, is.
00:45:06.330 - 00:45:08.666, Speaker C: It's a great business, has ETH, profit margins are won.
00:45:08.690 - 00:45:30.020, Speaker A: That game. I mean, is the Alt L1. I mean, I joked in the intro wrap for this episode, I said, oh, we're talking blockchains. Tell me, how big is its TPS? Which was always the joke. You said, not the joke. It was the value proposition for every Alt l one that's launched since 2017 was all. Yeah, but we got 10,000 transactions per socket.
00:45:30.020 - 00:46:00.504, Speaker A: Bitcoin has seven, ETH has 13, or whatever. That hasn't slowed bitcoin's adoption, and it hasn't slowed eths, but it did result in the launch of tens or hundreds of supposedly hyper performance blockchains. And not to dunk specifically, but even SwE and Aptos have launched basically under that same thesis. But if you have performant l two s, like, do you need entire other blockchains? It seems like the answer is more no than it's ever been.
00:46:01.164 - 00:46:21.796, Speaker C: Okay, I'll totally agree with that phrasing. There are things conceptually that makes sense that maybe you might need, like, a high performing l one for decentralized physical infrastructure. The issue is, if that doesn't actually happen soon, then Ethereum will scale to the point where they will include that as well.
00:46:21.820 - 00:46:22.468, Speaker A: I see. Yeah.
00:46:22.516 - 00:46:27.668, Speaker C: Just like what would happen with Cosmos, that will happen to that opportunity with the hyper whatever that.
00:46:27.716 - 00:46:28.532, Speaker A: Yeah. Latent.
00:46:28.628 - 00:46:29.660, Speaker C: The L2s aren't there yet.
00:46:29.732 - 00:46:30.292, Speaker A: Yeah, they're not.
00:46:30.348 - 00:46:36.172, Speaker C: They will be. They will be. So it's almost game. It's not quite game over, but I.
00:46:36.188 - 00:46:49.714, Speaker A: Think it's trending positive for Ethereum, sort of gobbling those use cases. I will say, just as on Solana in particular, this is one of the few alt l one s I kind of like. And it's because it's meaningfully differentiated from a technology standpoint.
00:46:49.754 - 00:46:49.962, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:46:49.978 - 00:47:09.210, Speaker A: It's not an EVM clone. Right. They've made very interesting different decisions. But what's the number one use case on Solana? Dude, it's nfts. It's not high speed. Even though it's built to handle high speed stuff, that those use cases haven't materialized at scale, which is, again, why I joke about TPS. Hasn't really matter, hasn't really been the differentiator, supposedly.
00:47:09.210 - 00:47:39.508, Speaker A: I'm told by some, uh, alt l one investors that there are these latent use cases that, but for having a high TPS blockchain, haven't been able to be explored by devs on blockchains yet. I'll believe it when I see it, but, um, it does seem like that ethereum dominance and 4844 is going to further solidify its commitment to the roll up regime. Um, is sort of taking hold, and, um. Okay, so is there any other l two stuff that's interesting that we haven't talked about that you're interested in?
00:47:39.556 - 00:47:43.380, Speaker C: Uh, some of the Z tape stuff is coming along a lot faster.
00:47:43.492 - 00:47:48.904, Speaker A: I hear such. I am not at all smart enough to understand where this is, but I do.
00:47:49.444 - 00:47:50.612, Speaker C: Tell me that you people are.
00:47:50.708 - 00:48:10.976, Speaker A: Well, that's what I'm saying. I see, like, competing narratives about ZK evms or ZK roll ups with EVM compatibility. I can't even say that we have a report. Christine Kim, I think, wrote a report on ZKVMS. Chuck on my team has written about it a lot, too. Compatibility versus equivalency, whatever. There's actually, don't listen to my uses of these terms because, I don't know, they mean specific things.
00:48:10.976 - 00:48:23.712, Speaker A: I just mean ethereum. Like ZK Rollups is sort of the goldmine. But I literally see major competing views on how close we are to these things actually launching and functioning.
00:48:23.888 - 00:48:24.696, Speaker C: Yes.
00:48:24.880 - 00:48:26.324, Speaker A: So I just don't know.
00:48:26.944 - 00:48:36.258, Speaker C: There are a few ones live in production, obviously. You need to decentralize the prover. That's the big one. And you need to make the prover not need like a data center.
00:48:36.426 - 00:48:39.746, Speaker A: Right. You know, like, it has to be, like, feasible.
00:48:39.890 - 00:48:57.858, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think, at least from my understanding, the stuff with the provers have been going well, and we're making progress there. And to me, once that happens, then you kind of have permission to go experiment like crazy, right? Throw some stuff on Mainnet and work out the kinks.
00:48:57.906 - 00:49:12.126, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think. Is that the. In your mind, I mean. So I guess just to set the tone here, we'll do an episode on ZK. It's important that we do, I think, but zero knowledge. It's private by default is the concept and thus private.
00:49:12.126 - 00:49:30.204, Speaker A: Also, it's also higher throughput because it aggregates. And the idea is these would be more efficient and more private. Yeah. And so it's seen as sort of the holy grail of l two scaling in general. Right. Is that how you view it? Is that.
00:49:32.264 - 00:49:58.022, Speaker C: Well, it's tough when you can't see it. I will say a huge concern for putting the world on chain is financial privacy. You don't want trade secrets leaking to competitors and stuff like that. So that's always been an issue with Ethereum, especially their accounts base versus Utxo.
00:49:58.158 - 00:49:59.954, Speaker A: Is a huge, it's also worse. Yeah.
00:50:00.534 - 00:50:02.590, Speaker C: So I mean, if they can figure.
00:50:02.622 - 00:50:04.238, Speaker A: That out, that seems huge.
00:50:04.286 - 00:50:05.150, Speaker C: It's a really big deal.
00:50:05.262 - 00:50:48.676, Speaker A: Do you think, let's say a really powerful ZK EVM that is incredibly decentralized, et cetera, like the real goal launches, but you have these other l two s, you have the op stack or the op stack, you have arbitrums. They're working. They have adoption already. Does usage and liquidity flow away from those into the new ZKVM? Or do they just upgrade to switch from optimistic roll ups to ZK rollups? How do you think that would play out? Because it seems a little bit like the innovator's dilemma here at that point. Most likely because it'll be a little while, probably still, maybe even years before the zks are ready. The optimistic roll ups, they're going to have been working. They're in market.
00:50:48.676 - 00:50:53.356, Speaker A: They're the incumbent. Right? Like do you think that the, with.
00:50:53.380 - 00:51:08.108, Speaker C: All these optimistic roll ups coming up, like you kind of break composability, right? So, and you lose a little bit of audibility. Like I like knowing what the Aave collateral is versus their liabilities.
00:51:08.196 - 00:51:12.508, Speaker A: And so what judging, because you have to go to all these places now to figure it out, you gotta add it all together.
00:51:12.596 - 00:51:19.656, Speaker C: No, I'm saying with the versus ozk, right. I mean you could do some, like some proofs, I guess, but the app.
00:51:19.680 - 00:51:24.848, Speaker A: Would have to like do the proofs to show you, right. Like they'd have to reveal information and.
00:51:24.856 - 00:51:57.322, Speaker C: You lose a little bit of sovereignty that you get with like the, you know, application specific roll ups. So I think those will stick around. They have a purpose for existing. I think you could have some, a lot of defi, move over to the ZK stuff just because you want composability between these roll ups and obviously the scaling benefits and transaction fees. So I think it's additive, if anything. But it's tough, right? You never know until it launches. And I think how it starts is really important.
00:51:57.322 - 00:52:05.054, Speaker C: The fact that optimistic rollups are out right now and have billions of dollars tvl those things tend to be quite sticky.
00:52:06.174 - 00:52:31.126, Speaker A: All right, let's move on. We talked about your interest in bitcoin at the top of the show. Some interesting stuff happening in bitcoin. There's obviously ordinals. Have you been following ordinals in general? A variety of. What do you think about bitcoin? Adding either nfts or even tokens? You see the BRC 20 tokens. Is that good in your mind or how do you think about that?
00:52:31.270 - 00:52:55.574, Speaker C: So anytime you take things off chain and try to put them on chain, that introduces minor extractable value. And that scares me a little bit because I think the ethereum people spend a lot of time on that. And personally I think it's fundamentally unsolvable. And so that concerns me a little bit. And it could detract from these cases.
00:52:55.614 - 00:52:59.514, Speaker A: Bitcoiners aren't ready to deal with it. They don't know how to deal with it.
00:52:59.854 - 00:53:00.534, Speaker C: Well, I just don't.
00:53:00.574 - 00:53:01.902, Speaker A: Or it just hurts bitcoin.
00:53:02.038 - 00:53:03.006, Speaker C: It just hurts bitcoin.
00:53:03.030 - 00:53:03.166, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:03.190 - 00:53:17.078, Speaker C: Like you're, you want it to be money and anytime, like, okay, I want to like inscribe data. Right. Like maybe there's some mev there, but like probably not, right. You're matching everything atomically.
00:53:17.166 - 00:53:17.794, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:18.774 - 00:53:24.242, Speaker C: And it's more fee for miners, which is great. But yeah, like I don't, you know.
00:53:24.358 - 00:53:25.554, Speaker A: It'S not why you're into bitcoin.
00:53:25.594 - 00:53:26.578, Speaker C: It's not why I'm into bitcoin.
00:53:26.626 - 00:53:33.826, Speaker A: Yeah. So. And you can do that on other things. Yeah, I mean, I think. I agree. I don't. It certainly shouldn't be the dominant use case for bitcoin.
00:53:33.826 - 00:54:04.534, Speaker A: I think. I don't think it's that big of a use case. Like when we look objectively, there are plenty of, plenty of bitcoin. Block space is being used for that. But in terms of like the number of like bitcoin supply that's like associated with this is very low. Yeah. What about if we did it elsewhere? What if we had a zk roll up on bitcoin, for example, or more expressive l two s? There's a lot of talk about drive chains which are merge mined side chains.
00:54:04.534 - 00:54:09.734, Speaker A: Does that interest you? Or is this something better left to just do on other chains?
00:54:10.434 - 00:54:26.394, Speaker C: Yeah, people using bitcoin is always good. I don't know, both culturally and from a tech muscle perspective, if bitcoin can still compete in that game.
00:54:27.214 - 00:54:50.964, Speaker A: I think it really, technically, I mentioned that. Ready? Layer one, paper. Bitcoin doing this type of stuff actually flies directly in the face of our expressed bitcoin thesis and mine personally, which is that it doesn't compete with ethereum. It shouldn't. Ethereum, contrary to what the ultrasound money boys think, does not compete with bitcoin on the verifiable scarcity of supply.
00:54:51.044 - 00:54:51.836, Speaker C: Yeah. And not only.
00:54:51.900 - 00:54:55.780, Speaker A: And they shouldn't, neither should they should. It's almost like, stay in your lane. That's one view.
00:54:55.852 - 00:54:56.268, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:56.356 - 00:55:02.332, Speaker A: And I kind of have that view. On the other hand, like you said, I think anyone paying for block space is great.
00:55:02.428 - 00:55:04.988, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. 100%. I mean, like, it is kind of.
00:55:04.996 - 00:55:09.558, Speaker A: A narrative breaker, though. If bitcoin starts to become a platform.
00:55:09.646 - 00:55:21.670, Speaker C: What's that in Silicon Valley? It's like, did I hear revenue? Like, no revenue. It's like, if you. Cause if you don't have something, then you're not gonna be compared to that other thing. If you have something and it's shitty, it's.
00:55:21.782 - 00:55:22.702, Speaker A: And you kind of look bad.
00:55:22.798 - 00:55:47.066, Speaker C: Yeah. But, like, even, like, the work they're doing with, like, account abstraction on Ethereum, like avocado wallet, which is like a product by Insta DaP, you can pay gas in any chain in USDC. I would love for them to add, like, a bitcoin option. So you pay for every however you want to do it. I think you can get. I don't know, this is a bit hypocritical. You're kind of scaling bitcoin custodially.
00:55:47.066 - 00:55:48.694, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I get it.
00:55:49.114 - 00:56:12.528, Speaker A: No, I get it. I mean, the other thing is, I really am of two minds, which I guess, technically makes me ambivalent on this overall question for bitcoin because I expressed the one obvious side of the thesis, which is like, dude, do the thing you're good at, right. Don't bog yourself down with all doing this other stuff. You're probably not going to compete on, like, smart contract type use cases with Ethereum and. Well, don't bother. Right. You know, can't.
00:56:12.528 - 00:56:24.208, Speaker A: You can't lose if you don't play, right? And instead stick to what you're good at. And that's been very good for bitcoin. It's why I. It's one of the things I love about bitcoin. One of the main things. On the other hand, I love bitcoin. I love its blockchain.
00:56:24.208 - 00:56:36.404, Speaker A: I think in many ways, it's the most credibly neutral blockchain. And, gosh, I'd rather have any other crypto stuff I want to do beyond bitcoin because I think it's the highest fidelity chain to do it on.
00:56:36.484 - 00:56:37.144, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:38.444 - 00:56:42.564, Speaker A: So I'm not really sure it's like, which way, western man? Right. I don't.
00:56:42.644 - 00:56:47.620, Speaker C: I'm probably. I lean more ossification, I think, in this world.
00:56:47.692 - 00:57:01.280, Speaker A: I think when it comes to those two competing visions, I probably do also. I'd rather not mess up a good thing. Thank shoot you for adding tons more functionality. Yeah, but I don't actually want actual ossification. I think there's just other upgrades.
00:57:01.312 - 00:57:12.216, Speaker C: No, no, for sure. And we do need upgrades, but, like, there's a lot of really smart bitcoiners, bitcoin developers, like, in the trenches, like, working on super niche things to, like.
00:57:12.320 - 00:57:12.768, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:12.856 - 00:57:15.592, Speaker C: Okay. Like, how do I download bitcoin core? Privately.
00:57:15.648 - 00:57:19.816, Speaker A: Right. Privately better. Like. Yeah, real sort of deep tech.
00:57:20.000 - 00:57:30.280, Speaker C: Exactly. And that's that you always need to maintain that. You always need to be thinking about that. And I don't mean to trivialize that, but if I was dictator of bitcoin.
00:57:30.312 - 00:58:20.904, Speaker A: That'S where I would put the resources right on the deep tech, making it function better, more securely, more privately, faster, instead of adding new user functionality. I think I fall on that thing too, but I am a little ambivalent, I think, in the scheme. I think the only bitcoin upgrade that I'm on the record really calling for is op CTV, which I think now, despite some pushback that Jeremy Rubin got last year when he advocated publicly, strongly for it, which is his, I think now most people are coming around to see that that's the simplest and safest covenants related upgrade to do so. I would love to see that, but pretty ambivalent or just have not formed a strong opinion, I think, for the reasons we discuss on most of the other stuff, and even including drive chains, which is probably the most controversial, widely talked about upgrade right now is drive chains.
00:58:21.204 - 00:58:28.424, Speaker C: Yeah. So what I don't understand, though, about the pro drive chain people are that there's not gonna be any meV.
00:58:28.804 - 00:58:29.584, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:30.124 - 00:58:31.604, Speaker C: Which is impossible. I don't even understand.
00:58:31.644 - 00:58:37.100, Speaker A: That's like, there will be Mev. Of course, the question I think they're worried about is whether miners have incentive.
00:58:37.132 - 00:58:38.988, Speaker C: To, you know, what's going on with stacks. Right.
00:58:39.116 - 00:58:40.580, Speaker A: A lot of mev, dude.
00:58:40.612 - 00:58:53.682, Speaker C: So, like, I don't know. So basically, you pledge your bitcoin and you validate the stack block, and there's this one miner who just understands this game and just doesn't include that transaction, includes their own transaction, gets all the.
00:58:53.698 - 00:59:07.090, Speaker A: Stacks rewards, literally takes the stacks transactions that are getting resubmitted but just basically replaces the Coinbase address with their own so they earn all the stacks from it. Clever. Simple. That's like very simple. Mev.
00:59:07.162 - 00:59:07.586, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:07.690 - 00:59:36.358, Speaker A: Oh, man, that's great. It's like a man in the middle attack. Yeah. That type of weird stuff would absolutely happen. And to be honest, I think in some ways it's a side chain in which the miners hold the keys, quote unquote, a drive chain. Is that better than a federated side chain of any type? I guess the peg in and peg out is more decentralized and permissionless than a hosted sidechain. Liquids.
00:59:36.406 - 00:59:51.078, Speaker C: Peg in, peg out, yes and no. Because you don't. You need enough people like the WP, like the bitco model. You don't need everyone to be able to mint redeem. You just need enough people and then there's a market price for it.
00:59:51.126 - 01:00:06.230, Speaker A: Right, right. Well, interesting stuff has happened, man. Trey, this is a great conversation. Thank you so much for coming. And we'll do it again. Dude, Trey. As Lonnie on Trey of the house of lion from Galaxy trading, my friend.
