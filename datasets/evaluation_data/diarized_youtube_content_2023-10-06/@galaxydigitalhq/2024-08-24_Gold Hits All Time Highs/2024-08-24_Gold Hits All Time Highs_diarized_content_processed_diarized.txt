00:00:00.560 - 00:00:35.995, Speaker A: Outside of that, I'm paying super close attention to the price action in gold. We're at all time highs. It's not accelerating higher, but the fact that it just continues to grind higher. It's supported by a dollar that's been weakening lately. If you've seen euro go from 107 to almost 111 now, dollar yen had the big move, so you've had a pretty decent dollar sell off. And that's helping Gold risk sentiment has been okay. S P has rallied back pretty, pretty close to the highs once again.
00:00:35.995 - 00:00:50.095, Speaker A: And so, you know, and given kind of the lack of allocation to gold in terms of just, you know, looking at, you know, large asset managers, you know, family offices, et cetera like that, that commodity exposure is still super low in a lot of portfolios.
