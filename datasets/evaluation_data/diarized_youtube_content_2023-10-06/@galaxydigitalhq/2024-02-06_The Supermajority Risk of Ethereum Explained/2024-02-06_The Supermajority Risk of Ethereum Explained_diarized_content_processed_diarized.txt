00:00:00.400 - 00:01:11.514, Speaker A: Welcome to the infinite Jungle, the podcast about the evolution of Ethereum. I'm your host Christine Kim, VP of research at Galaxy, and this is the second episode of the show. I want to give a huge thanks and shout out to everyone who tuned in for the trailer of the show last week and tuned into the first episode. I've been watching everybody's reactions and feedback on the show, and it's made me really pleased to hear about how excited people are for this series. I need to remind you to please refer to the disclaimer linked in the podcast show notes and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice, an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Today on the show we're going to be summarizing all core developer execution call Acde number 180 and we're also going to be inviting on two very special guests who are extremely knowledgeable about Ethereum staking. We're going to have ETH staker, Nixo and crypto manufacturers Torsten on the show for the second half.
00:01:11.514 - 00:01:51.714, Speaker A: But to start off, let's do what we normally do or what we're going to normally do on these shows to kick us off and summarize the latest ACD call. We're recording this on Friday, so a day after the call has happened. These calls usually happen on Thursdays. Cde 180 I'm not going to go in order of how everything was shared according to the agenda. If you want the full summary going line item by line item for what was talked about, be sure to check out the summary the write up of the summary on galaxy.com dot. You can find the full thing posted there.
00:01:51.714 - 00:02:42.614, Speaker A: I'm just going to give quick highlights and go over first, kind of my takes on what I thought was the most interesting parts of the call. First up was Denkun updates. There was the sepolia hard fork that happened last Tuesday, January 30, and developers gave a little bit of a debrief on how the Denkun hard fork went. There really wasn't much to share. It was like one sentence from Perry, who's an EF Ethereum Foundation DevOps engineer, and he basically said it went fine. It was a pretty uneventful fork. The upgrade went smoothly, which is good news, and also news that was different from when the upgrade had been activated on the prior testnet Goraly.
00:02:42.614 - 00:03:29.096, Speaker A: There had been some issues on chain, some disruptions to the network, so it was a little bit of a relief to see how well the upgrade went on Sepolia. Nothing out of the ordinary almost to speak of. So developers are going to be now upgrading the third and final ethereum test, public test ad Holski tomorrow. Well it's Friday, I'm recording this on Friday, but the podcast is going to come out Tuesday. And basically the upgrade happens on Wednesday. So by the time you guys are listening to this, the upgrade is going to be happening the day after on Wednesday, February 7. This will be the last public testnet to be upgraded before Ethereum mainnet.
00:03:29.096 - 00:04:42.934, Speaker A: So developers are really kind of getting to the end of the testing cycle for this upgrade and lots of anticipation for when exactly Denkun is going to hit Mainnet. I still have a lot of conviction that it's probably going to happen in March, but developers agreed on Acde 180 to actually decide, decide when the Mainnet fork date is going to be on the next ACD call, which is AC DC. I don't know exactly what number, but basically next week's call after the whole ski upgrade goes ahead, which developers presumably are thinking that it's going to go pretty smoothly. They want to be able to set the date for Mainnet on Thursday, February 8. So it's a really tight turnaround and developers could potentially schedule out the mainnet activation date three weeks from there, which would put the upgrade basically at the end of this month, end of February. I think that's it could happen, but that's still a very tight turnaround. That's also around the time when ETH Denver is gonna happen, which is, I believe North America is one of North America's largest Ethereum developer conferences.
00:04:42.934 - 00:05:24.974, Speaker A: So it may be that to try and kind of avoid that conference time, developers kind of push it out to sometime in early March. But of course these are all just kind of predictions of what may or may not happen. Developers going to be talking about when to schedule the mainnet activation on the next ACD call. So it'll be a pretty exciting one to watch. I will highlight though about some of the things that developers are looking at in terms of the Dankun upgrade. Two things that were pretty noteworthy. One of the Nethermine developers had said that they're trying to investigate a bug that's causing the blob mempool to grow beyond the limits that it has.
00:05:24.974 - 00:06:38.816, Speaker A: They notice that when they started spamming one of the devnets, which is kind of a closed test network just for developers, when they started spamming Devnet twelve, they noticed that validator participation rates dropped by more than 20%. So they're looking into it. They're not sure exactly what's going on, but they're going to try and do further testing on not just Devnet twelve, but Gourlay as well, which went through the Den kun upgrade. And then the second kind of thing to note about what developers are still looking at as it relates to the Den Koon upgrade is what the prison team is investigating. The PrisM team said that they noticed some unusual activity regarding a late block proposal on the sepolia testnet that didn't include any block transactions when I guess it was supposed to include those block transactions. So two kind of items that need to be dug into further, investigated further, and if it does prove to be an issue across clients that needs updating, that needs fixing across more than one client, then I can see that also delaying the upgrade on Mainnet. So something to keep an eye out for.
00:06:38.816 - 00:07:33.458, Speaker A: We'll get more details on it on the next ACD call. So yeah, that was really the summary for the update for Den Koon on yesterday's call. The most probably the majority of the call though was spent talking about what developers should be focusing on for the next upgrade after Prague. Prog electra the combined upgrade name is Pektra. I think one of the comments on Twitter when I was talking about these upgrades, one of the comments on Twitter was that developers need to stop using very obscure names for naming these upgrades. But the naming convention, I will say it's kind of a fun fact, is for the consensus layer upgrades, developers try and name the upgrades after major stars. So Elektra I believe is the name of a constellation or a star.
00:07:33.458 - 00:08:12.190, Speaker A: And then for the execution layer upgrades they name it after major cities. So Prague is a city. The upgrade after Prague is supposedly going to be called Osaka. I've been trying to get developers to try and upgrade the next upgrade after Osaka to be Seoul, but there's quite a lot of, quite a lot of what you call it support for potentially naming it after a major african city after Osaka. But anyways, not important in terms of the technical details. Let's get into a little bit of what developers talked about. For Prague, they discussed three major code changes, Verkle, EOF and history expiry.
00:08:12.190 - 00:09:19.950, Speaker A: If you want a little bit more detail on what these upgrades entail, be sure to check out the full write up. Verkl is basically an upgrade to the way that data is structured on Ethereum to make it more efficient and is kind of a necessary precursor to what developers call statelessness, which is another kind of major upgrade that Ethereum developers want to move towards, but they can't get to it until they upgrade and overhaul Ethereum's data structure, which is currently technically structured in merkle trees, and they want to change it to verkle trees. So this is the verkle upgrade they talked about. Virkl EOF is a bundle of various code changes that are all geared towards upgrading the EVM. The EVM is Ethereum's virtual machine. It's the part of Ethereum that is able to execute smart contract code. It's what makes Ethereum general purpose, the fact that you can so easily code transactions with various conditions attached to it.
00:09:19.950 - 00:10:04.790, Speaker A: It's all because Ethereum has a virtual machine and the EVM. Ethereum was the very first general purpose blockchain to ever exist in the world. So its virtual machine is the oldest. And there's obviously been a ton of development on general purpose computation on blockchains since 2015, when Ethereum launched. So there's quite a lot of major upgrades that developers want to make to the EVM, and a lot of those changes that would help improve the EVM functionality is called EOF. The third and the last is history expiry. This really has to do with kind of the size of Ethereum state growing over time, as the blockchain has to keep records of just a constantly growing amount of accounts, transactions and whatnot.
00:10:04.790 - 00:11:18.144, Speaker A: History expiry basically means that trying to transition the network so that it stops having to serve historical block data on the peer to peer layer after a certain period of time. So developers really went in depth on how ready these upgrades are for potentially a Prague upgrade. And basically they decided that Verkle, while it's super important and getting kind of close to the finish line for implementation, although some developers would still suggest that by close to the finish line they mean like, it's still probably over a year out before it can really hit main net. They agreed that as important as VRKL is, they're gonna push VRKL off to the Osaka upgrade. So not planning it for the next immediate upgrade after Dankun, but pushing it to Osaka and then for the EOF upgrade, there's still quite a bit of controversy. I noticed that there was quite a lot of discussion also about will EOF be compatible with the VRKL upgrade? Which to be quite honest, I didn't quite understand, because during the conversation.
00:11:20.644 - 00:11:20.908, Speaker B: A.
00:11:20.916 - 00:11:56.834, Speaker A: Lot of what EOF is trying to do is kind of improve the way that transactions are executed on Ethereum, improve the EVM. And it was difficult for me to grasp kind of why it wouldn't be compatible with something like the Virkel upgrade EOF. There's still conversations happening around it. There wasn't a firm, you know, yes, it's gonna go into Prague. No, it's not gonna go into Prague. Quite a lot of concern that EOF should be included in Prague. But if there does appear to be some kind of a conflict between the EOF and the vertical upgrade, then developers should just not do EOf at all.
00:11:56.834 - 00:13:00.534, Speaker A: So still more conversation to come on EOF. As for the last one, history expiry, it turns out that a lot of the preparation work that needs to happen for history expiry can happen independently of a hard fork. So developers don't need to change anything about the Ethereum protocol. They have to really focus on kind of finalizing the data formats that an alternative peer to peer network would be able to support and be able to service all this historical block data so that when users are trying to access it on Ethereum and because of history expiry, they can't because it's, the data's too old, they can go to an alternative peer to peer network called the portal network and be able to access that data. So making sure that that alternative network is up and running, reliable, has the data in the right data format. All of that work will take roughly about a year or so. So developers agreed to start working on it now in parallel to whatever prog ends up becoming as an upgrade.
00:13:00.534 - 00:14:44.524, Speaker A: So pretty good progress, I would say, on these items week, developers will continue to kind of debate and hash out the real scope of Prague. And I think now, you know, now that developers have agreed, Verkl is gonna be in Osaka and history expiry is gonna be worked on in parallel. I think the real big question to be continuing to ask is, is EOF gonna be included in Prague or not? And then on the consensus layer side, as I had mentioned during the last episode, our major items like inclusion lists and the increase to the maximum effective balance, are these code changes going to be perhaps reconsidered or re included in Prague for reasons to do with kind of like how important they are to ethereum security and how important they are to ethereum censorship resistance? So still lots of open ended questions and debates still to come for figuring out what the next upgrade on Ethereum after Dankun is gonna look like. But I think this is a good place to kind of transition over to chatting with our guests, because two of the topics on the call that I didn't one of the topics, I should say, but there were two items talked about. One of the topics that I didn't get into the call but I wanna get into with Nixo and Torsen is the topic of client diversity. So the call started off with kind of a postmortem on a major outage that happened with Baiesu nodes. Baesu is an execution layer client on Ethereum, and roughly about 70% of Bayzu nodes had suddenly went offline on January 6.
00:14:44.524 - 00:15:44.814, Speaker A: So the beginning of the call was really talking about why that happened and to that event, how important client diversity was to make sure that even if those nodes had gone offline, there were other types of execution layer clients that were still being run by nodes and still making sure that the network reached finalization. And there's also a pr, this was the second item related to client diversity. There was a pr that was opened on GitHub to try and gather some more accurate data on what execution layer clients are being run, how diverse execution layer clients really are. On Ethereum, there's a suggestion on how to make, how to make sourcing that data just a lot more accurate. So that's an important topic that developers are talking about and that I think we'll be able to get into further with Nixo and Torsten. So let's go over and chat with them now. Thank you guys so much for joining the infinite jungle pod.
00:15:45.514 - 00:15:47.514, Speaker C: Happy to be here. Thanks for having us.
00:15:47.674 - 00:17:02.044, Speaker A: I'm so excited to talk with you guys about Ethereum staking, because while I focus a lot on what developers are doing, and of course developers are important for, you know, thinking about how Ethereum could develop in the future and really being forward looking people, the people who keep the lights on on Ethereum day to day, the day to day people who are keeping Ethereum up and running are the validator node operators, it's the stakers. And I think you guys do not get enough appreciation for what you do for Ethereum every single day. So Nixxo, Thorsten, you guys are incredible and also excited to talk a little bit about how much development and how much improvement we've been seeing on a topic that both of you guys have been quite vocal on. Client diversity. Developers talked about it yesterday on the call as well, and it's been a major topic that it's always been something that people have been saying should improve, that Geth has too much of a majority. And Torsen, you've talked about the biggest risk is what if there's a bug in Geth and, you know, 90% of nodes go down. I was quite impressed to see certain staking, major staking, staking node operators say that they're going to switch away from Geth.
00:17:02.044 - 00:17:29.816, Speaker A: But how effective do you actually think that this time around things are going to change? Because from my point of view, the majority client of Geth, we've tried before to kind of change this, but it doesn't seem like a problem that's really going to change anytime soon, especially with the incentives that we have on Ethereum today. And social pressure, as we know, is kind of a very short lived.
00:17:30.000 - 00:18:22.756, Speaker C: I will say there hasn't been like a huge effort before, maybe six months ago, and that's because the other clients were not necessarily ready for that change to be relied on as replacements for Geth for a lot of large node operators. But I'll let Yorick talk about the fact that he runs a lot of keys. And we published a blog post last year that was sort of like, okay, we're ready to start. We're ready to start pushing for execution layer diversity. And so this is really like the first time that I've ever seen like the social layer engage in a way that they said, oh my God, I finally understand what this risk is because people didn't. I did a poll I think like three or four months ago that said, how much could I lose in this scenario? And 25% of people who responded the poll got it right. And so the people just really didn't understand what the risk was.
00:18:22.756 - 00:19:00.804, Speaker C: And with this latest social layer push, I'm hopeful that people are actually taking it seriously because I did reach out to quite a few node operators, large node operators, maybe four months ago. And I said, here's a blog post we just published, send this to your engineers. What do you need to convince you to switch over? What more data can we provide? And they basically said, cool, thanks for the heads up. We don't really have the engineering resources for this. They didn't take it seriously. I didn't feel like they really passed it on to their teams, but now I feel like they're taking it a little bit more seriously. York, do you have anything to add?
00:19:01.744 - 00:19:50.126, Speaker B: I agree with that. As this latest push came to be, and I think it was maybe just a combination of things, Nethermind and Besu had bugs in short order. BesU was not consensus impacting, never mind was. And people took the right lesson from that, which is really heartening. They didn't say, oh, Besu, Nethermind are horrible. We shouldn't be running them. They said, what if that Nethermind bug happens in geth, right? And then just, I think, like a week before that, Sam from Estategre had said, hey, Yorick, Torsten, you know how you keep talking about using different clients and this risk, we don't have numbers.
00:19:50.126 - 00:20:32.380, Speaker B: So that's a good point. So we created a little spreadsheet with just like, an upper bound, right? Which said we can lose as a chain some $45 billion if this happens, some stupid amount. Right? That's the loss. That's the upper bound. Maybe not quite as bad because ACD comes up with an irregular state change to allow the minority chain to finalize faster, but whatever, right? So I think those two things really. Yeah, those two things really made a difference. And then crypto zitter got all in into it, which I'm actually glad for this time round.
00:20:32.380 - 00:21:03.054, Speaker B: One thing I learned in this discussion, and this was happening on the ethnic discord, is the language we use was confusing. So we kept talking about client diversity. And I had a user say to me, you know, I always thought this was like charity. I'm like, charity? Why charity? Oh, because of what diversity means in the broader non crypto culture. Right? They were thinking it had, it was a feel good, it was a woke thing. It was a political thing. I'm like, no, it's about super majority risk.
00:21:03.054 - 00:21:16.974, Speaker B: Then why don't you say super majority risk? Like, hmm, okay, good point. So we actually renamed our channel on the discord to super majority risk because that's what it's about. Right.
00:21:17.314 - 00:21:36.902, Speaker C: I did. I also encountered that control the super majority risk. Yeah. I also encountered that, like, three months ago, I was talking to a user on Reddit who was pushing back in the east taker subreddit and saying, like, I don't want to take on this risk. I don't want to run a minority client that's maybe less stable than gethsemane just for the good of the. Just for some altruistic cause. And I was like, hold on a second.
00:21:36.902 - 00:21:44.634, Speaker C: This isn't altruism. This is entirely a selfish choice for you to make. And I think that wasn't necessarily clear to everybody.
00:21:45.374 - 00:21:46.070, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:46.222 - 00:23:00.934, Speaker A: And just for our listeners, I do want to say Torsten also goes by Yorick. So when we switch around, sometimes just in terms of our listeners, we're talking about the same person. But I mean, going back to kind of the conversation around diversity being, like a charged word, there definitely is an element, though, of altruism in the sense that if you don't genuinely think that the minority client that you're running is more performant, is more secure, is at least competitive to the geth client that you could have run. I think that it does feel like a little bit of a loss. Like, if you genuinely think that geth, the likelihood of a bug being in geth, and you losing out on participation rewards or attestation rewards, because there's a higher likelihood of a bug and a more experimental client, I can see why it's a little bit of a harder transition. If you think the tooling and the documentation around the minority client is not as. As robust as the documentation and tooling around Geth, maybe you think that it's gonna be another parody, and one day it's just gonna be deprecated and you're gonna have to move over to another client again.
00:23:00.934 - 00:23:42.234, Speaker A: But, Nyxo, to your point, I think you were saying how, like, there's actually been a ton of development to bring minority clients up to the same level of competitiveness to geth as of late. And I'm curious to know, in terms of, like, continued funding and just development for making minority clients as competitive to geth, how confident are we that, like, sometimes it feels like clients are a public good. It's not a software that, like, you can make a ton of money off of. And, of course, Geth, which is backed by Ethereum foundation, which had the ICO. Okay, well, maybe I won't call it an ICO, but, you know, it had a funding. Okay. It had funding from the very beginning.
00:23:42.234 - 00:24:07.614, Speaker A: How likely is it that minority clients are finding very interesting ways to stay competitive, to continue its funding and to make sure that what they do isn't just seen as a public good, kind of like a charity, that they're a charity case, which they shouldn't be. They should be as important to Ethereum as the Ethereum foundation is and the products they're building.
00:24:08.434 - 00:24:11.376, Speaker B: Okay, I'll take that then. Or do you want to take that?
00:24:11.570 - 00:24:12.452, Speaker C: Both of you, though?
00:24:12.508 - 00:24:30.756, Speaker A: Both of you have, you know, this goes into kind of future looking. Will this. Will this keep going? Because for me, even though I'm not a node operator, I would imagine that as a node operator, I would never, ever switch off a gift if the quality of minority clients just don't continue to do so.
00:24:30.780 - 00:25:20.790, Speaker B: I have so many thoughts on that. Right. Can I start with quality before I get into funding? I've been running Nethermind and Besu for one and a half years with now 10,000 keys. It performs great. These are absolutely competitive clients. For staking in particular, right? On the RPC side, there's sometimes some behavior where I'm like, this is weird. And I think that comes mostly from historically there wasn't an RPC specific, it was whatever Geth is doing, which is very hard to write to, right? So if your application just only runs with Geth and you're using it as an RPC node, go for it, right? That's the other thing we need to say.
00:25:20.790 - 00:26:04.934, Speaker B: We care about validators here. We're caring about the security of the chain and the security of your ETH that you have staked. RPC nodes do not do validation, run whatever works with your app. Right? So for staking, both Nethermind and Besu have been great. The other part about hey, it's so hard to switch, I hear you. If you're doing this now and you're creating the tooling to switch, I highly recommend, if you haven't done so already, to lean hard into IAC infrastructure as code and write this so that you can switch out the client with a minimum of effort. So, you know, I'm going to brag a little bit here.
00:26:04.934 - 00:26:54.826, Speaker B: We have switched out one client, we were running a third client instead of Nevermind, and peso replaced it with Nevermind, I think, complete with the quality assurance. It took us 4 hours total across the entire fleet. Because everything's ansible, everything's automated, it's simple, right? Replace, I'm not going to say other client yaml. I don't want to rag on them too hard with, never mind, we love ragging. So this can be done. There's a lot of really smart engineers working for these large staking outfits. If they take this opportunity to strengthen their IAC or create it from scratch, if it doesn't exist, it'll work.
00:26:54.826 - 00:27:47.250, Speaker B: The way to run these clients well is also well documented. I will once more offer because I want to protect my own bags. I am happy to give anyone who has a large staking outfit 15 to 30 minutes of my time, free of charge, to just chat and say, these are the parameters we're running it with. This is how it's been working for us, right? Just so that, and I say protecting my own bags, because if this worst case scenario comes to happen or comes to pass, all ethereum suffers, whether you're staking or not staking, whether you're just holding it, it doesn't matter. The impact is truly catastrophic and we don't want to be there. So funding, I don't know where Nethermind are getting their money from. But they're not just doing the client, so they seem to be fine.
00:27:47.412 - 00:28:00.554, Speaker C: I'm not worried their client team is actually very small compared to the book of the Nethermind team in general. They do a lot of things in the ecosystem and they're like, they're a very large team with a very small client.
00:28:01.134 - 00:28:21.342, Speaker B: I am not worried that consensus is running out of money anytime soon. And I'm not worried that paradigm is running out of money. Yeah, I'm not worried that paradigm is running out of money anytime soon. That's the rest client. Right. Which is coming up fast. I've been very impressed with how stable they already are in Alpha.
00:28:21.342 - 00:28:31.366, Speaker B: Really looking forward to them going general availability sometime after Dengkun. And this is the other part, like why, why do people do this? Right, sorry, Nix. Just one more thing.
00:28:31.390 - 00:28:33.034, Speaker C: No, that's exactly what I was going to say.
00:28:33.534 - 00:28:55.550, Speaker B: Why do they do this? Right. Paradigm doesn't build wrath out of the goodness of their heart. They're building it because they want to be at the, I'm pretty sure they're building it because they want to be at the table. Right. And to be at the table, they had a choice. They could have done, like, I forget which L2 bought prism. They could have been done, done that and bought a team.
00:28:55.550 - 00:29:17.622, Speaker B: Or they could have said, we're just building another client. And they chose to tackle the hard, the really hard one, which is an execution layer client, which I give them a lot of kudos for, to do this from scratch. Right. That's the hard one. That gives them a seat at the table. That gives them a seat in ACD. Right.
00:29:17.622 - 00:29:25.394, Speaker B: This is valuable to them. They're a vc and they want that seat at the table within Ethereum. That's. That's how I see it. Nick's go ahead.
00:29:26.174 - 00:30:52.334, Speaker C: Another thing I wanted to harp on is you were talking about, like, what if one of the client, one of the client, the client, the minority client that we choose is deprecated, goes down in crypto? I think that we're very used to having startups operate a bunch of things, and so we expect less of them. But in terms of like, right now, the protocols that are running your stake, you should absolutely be expecting the most from. So in terms of risk mitigation, when they say, what is the risk of this other client having a bug or not getting maybe as many attestations or their effectiveness not being as high, they should be factoring the catastrophic risk that there is in the very small chance. And if they're not taking the whole picture of your risk profile into account when they talk to you about this or when they make decisions about their architecture. I would be concerned about that. I would also be concerned about a team who says, well, we don't want to switch in the case that a client gets deprecated because that means that the engineering team has no backup plan and they should always have a backup plan no matter if they're running the super majority client, the super stable client or not. If they're not comfortable switching execution layer clients, I would already be concerned about this team and like people who stake with an operation who says, oh, we run Geth and only geth because it's the most stable client.
00:30:52.334 - 00:30:58.246, Speaker C: I would say, well, if there's ever a bug, I know that my stake is screwed because you guys have no idea what you're doing.
00:30:58.430 - 00:32:08.406, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I will say, Nyxo, when you had posted on Twitter like the exact template of what message or email you should write to your staking provider to ask them these hard questions, I thought that was such a perfect way to make it as easy as possible for people who might not have a technical background but are relying on more technical people to kind of do this risk management for them to follow up. And I will reemphasize again the offer that York made on this pod for large stakers to get a little bit of his time, 15 to 30 minutes for free. You guys, that's a big offer. His time is valuable. But yeah, and also, I mean, Yorick, to your point of having like a seat at the table, we cannot discount how much of a value that is for client teams that are building execution layer clients consensus layer clients to have a seat at the table. I would also say that given the nature of the Denkun upgrade, I'm quite surprised at how l two s and roll up teams don't really seem to have as big of a voice on these calls.
00:32:08.406 - 00:32:58.436, Speaker A: The developers were saying yesterday, you know, we really need more feedback from l two s on how this upgrade, which is for l two s, are going to be working for l two s. I mean, from the perspective of the staking community, you guys had a huge seat at the table for Shanghai. That being the first upgrade that happened after the merge, when a ton of other priorities could have made it in, I thought the staking community really made their voice heard. We need to get withdrawals in. Is there a similar push in the Ethereum staking community to get certain eips in for Prague? I know Dancoon was kind of commandeered by the l two s, but really their voice, I don't know where it is right now, but like staking. I'm wondering if the staking community is really going to stand up to say, like we need maximum effective balance now, or like, you know, what is kind of your guys view on what are the efps that need to be prioritized for, for Prague?
00:32:58.620 - 00:33:45.892, Speaker C: So I think the two eips that I would like to see included, I think that definitely not both of them are going to be included, but maybe not even. Maybe not even either of them are inclusion lists and max effective balance. Max effective balance because I think that it really helps solo stakers in the ability to compound their rewards, which is a huge reason to stake with a big organization right now. Because once you get anything over 32, you're not compounding that. You just have to kind of have to hold on to that until you can get to another 32, which takes a really long time if you only have one validator. Inclusionless is, I think, equally as important, but I think that it should be viewed as sort of like a larger ecosystem problem. Because I think we have one builder that's not censoring right now.
00:33:45.892 - 00:34:04.444, Speaker C: And so if that one builder decides to censor, we're in a, in an unprecedented place where homestakers are like the, the ones who are really holding up the censorship resistance of the network. And more of this responsibility should be on more than just home stickers.
00:34:04.864 - 00:34:13.244, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really bad look. I think even right now for Ethereum and its censorship resistance, it's not talked about enough and it's a little bit embarrassing. But anyways.
00:34:20.684 - 00:35:09.954, Speaker B: I'm actually thinking that the one I care most about is ERP 7002, the one that allows you to exit with the withdrawal address. It has a bunch of advantages, obviously, for large pools, because they now no longer can be held over a barrel by their node operators. That is good. I think it also can simplify things for home stickers. One of the things we see that is most difficult for people is to keep their mnemonics safe. So they could potentially change their entire setup process to say, I'm creating these keys and I have a withdrawal address set from the word go. That's absolutely crucial.
00:35:09.954 - 00:35:28.718, Speaker B: Don't forget that part. And then I throw away this mnemonic. I no longer care about it. If I need to withdraw or exit, I use my Ethereum wallet for that which I am already securing, as everybody does. Right. So I think that is a good thing. To do beyond that.
00:35:28.718 - 00:36:17.146, Speaker B: I'm actually really keen on EOF EVM object format. And for me it's mostly because I think this will really bring value to the user layer, to the smart contracts. It will be easier to write bigger smart contracts because Ethereum can safely increase the size of these. It will be easier to reason about security because we have a separation of data and code. Overall this is a good thing. And the sooner we have that in so developers can start using it, which on their end is really probably just one check mark in their compiler of choice. Nothing really changes from a code perspective.
00:36:17.146 - 00:36:31.894, Speaker B: It just, you end up with code that's easier to reason about. I think that's really valuable. And for stakers, anything that helps the Ethereum ecosystem helps stakers. We all are holders of relatively large amounts of ETH.
00:36:32.274 - 00:36:39.674, Speaker A: You know, if you want fees, if you want, you know, mev rewards, you're gonna have to attract more users and.
00:36:41.614 - 00:36:58.390, Speaker B: Yeah, and if I want my 32 ETH to be worth two x at some point, or even more, you know, yay the moon, then I need, I need the ecosystem, I need the users to start using ETH so it gains in value. Right, that's true.
00:36:58.542 - 00:38:01.264, Speaker A: I mean I, unfortunately though it does. I think there's quite a lot of controversy and pushback to including EOf into the Prague upgrade. And even more so I would say for inclusion list and max effective balance, saying that these are just, they might delay the upgrade. It's too complex. The voice of developers I think are very keen on, they're not always aligned with the interests of Ethereum users, or the interest of Ethereum stakers, or the interests of perhaps even l two roll up teams and what should be prioritized for an upgrade? How important do you think it is that more people from the Ethereum staking community, more stakeholders from the Ethereum community outside of core developers show up at these calls and start petitioning for some of these upgrades to be included. I think it's, it's almost a little bit taboo in Ethereum. It feels like to go against the will of core developers.
00:38:01.264 - 00:38:18.244, Speaker A: But I'm wondering, given that you guys just shared some of the code changes you'd like to see, and I'm letting you know that I'm listening on these calls and it doesn't look great for these code changes and their occlusion for Prague, I'm wondering, what is your thinking behind this?
00:38:19.104 - 00:38:45.348, Speaker C: I wish that more home stakers would take an interest in stuff like this. And I think that things like your podcast starting will really help because people have a lot of trouble digesting everything that goes through the all core desk call. I know when I go through the all core devs call, I kind of put it on in the background. I tune in and out of it sometimes because there's a lot that's happening. There's conversation, there's back and forth. There's some stuff I don't care about. And so stuff that gives you the high level is really, really helpful.
00:38:45.348 - 00:39:18.564, Speaker C: But when it comes to things that benefit homestakers, there's really no one there at the call to advocate for this homestaking minority. And so there are a lot of people trying to get seats, whose jobs depend on it, who are well funded to be lobbying for it. And so stakers really don't have anyone who is at that table. And so I think it's really important for people to go and try to make their voice heard, but it's always hard to get people super involved in, like, the real technical consensus layer, research.
00:39:19.004 - 00:39:32.828, Speaker B: And I think that's the risk. Right. We want to be a little careful that we don't have Nics showing up and saying, I am homestakers. Right. I'm pointing fingers at you, nicks. I'd be the same thing. Right.
00:39:32.828 - 00:40:12.506, Speaker B: Or anybody but Sam Colfax or the Eave staker crew, we don't speak for home stakers. We really can't. Right. And so what I notice is the same kind of energy you had with miners you have with validators, which is they're really not focused on protocol things. Right. When you think back to Feeburn, EIP 1559, it was being discussed for years. I think literally like six years is how long it took.
00:40:12.506 - 00:40:43.832, Speaker B: And then six months before it went into a hard fork. When all was said and done, then the miners got all about it. Like, wait, hold up. You know you're gonna burn. What? So I, you know, if you're a solo staker and listening to this, I encourage you to read Kim's tweets every week that done an absolutely amazing job of summing up what's happening in ACD. I rely on this. I don't listen to ACD.
00:40:43.832 - 00:40:57.656, Speaker B: I outed myself just now. I don't. It's rare. Sometimes I'll go in and I'll scrub to somewhere to hear a little bit more. I did actually this time. And I still feel hopeful for Euf. From what I saw in the chat notes and so on.
00:40:57.656 - 00:41:21.004, Speaker B: It didn't seem to be a ton of pushback on that idea. We'll see next time they talk. But yeah, I encourage you to take those 510 minutes every week, seek out Kim's twitter and read the too long, didn't watch, which is always amazing, and then just see what you care about.
00:41:21.664 - 00:42:13.834, Speaker A: Yeah, 100% no, I appreciate that. And I got to say, wow, what a wild time when miners were at the table and vying for what code changes and what code changes not to go into upgrades. That really was a wild time in Ethereum and still more wild times to come. So for sure. Thank you so much, Nixo and Torsten, for joining me on infinite Jungle, telling me about your thoughts on client diversity on Prague. I am very looking forward to how Prague scoped out will end up looking like we're going to have to have both of you guys back on because one of the topics we didn't touch on today but I do want to get into with you guys is also the topic of stake centralization. And as we talk about kind of the growth of staking pools, and I'm sure by the time we chat again, maybe there'll be more developments on eigen layers so we can talk about that.
00:42:13.834 - 00:42:46.030, Speaker A: Lots to get into, but maybe as kind of like a fun final question for Ethereum, for people who are very into Ethereum culture, what's one of the ethereum conferences that you guys know you are definitely going to and are very looking forward to this year? Because for people listening, Ethereum has like 100 conferences every and some of the most, the most obscure places in the world you would not believe. But anyways, maybe starting off with Nixo, what's the conference that you're most looking forward to?
00:42:46.222 - 00:43:14.204, Speaker C: Defcon. Definitely Defcon. It was my favorite conference last Defcon, and it's such a high quality conference. Last time they did the public goods booths, every talk felt really valuable and not chilly at all. Everybody I met there was a builder, a developer, or doing something great for the ecosystem. And I've never been to Thailand, so I'm excited for Bangkok.
00:43:14.784 - 00:43:17.608, Speaker A: Love that. Tyson.
00:43:17.776 - 00:43:21.376, Speaker B: I'm definitely gonna be at FCC. I'm looking forward to it.
00:43:21.520 - 00:43:23.320, Speaker A: It's in Berlin this year, right?
00:43:23.512 - 00:43:24.280, Speaker C: Brussels.
00:43:24.432 - 00:43:24.848, Speaker A: Brussels.
00:43:24.896 - 00:43:33.204, Speaker B: Brussels. Okay. Yes. Not in Paris. It's in Brussels. Okay. See, I'm not paying attention, but I'm looking forward to it.
00:43:33.204 - 00:43:56.632, Speaker B: I really hope I can sample. Bangkok talent has a bill on the table this year again to allow people like me to remain married when they're coming across the border. So if that happens, I'll be there. If it doesn't happen, I won't. I have a very strict rule that I only travel where the moment I step over the border. I'm still a married man.
00:43:56.768 - 00:44:43.384, Speaker A: So love that. Your partner should be proud. Amazing. Well, thank you guys so much again, and thank you to people who have listened in for the second episode of infinite Jungle. We are going to be back next week, of course, for this series, doing another summary of the ACD calls and talking again, going a little bit deeper into Ethereum ecosystem stuff. It was a pleasure to be able to go into Ethereum staking and talk a little bit more about the staking. What's going on with the staking community with Nixxio and Yorick today? And if you liked and enjoyed this episode, please be sure to like the episode and subscribe to the show and do, you know, comment, do your thing.
00:44:43.384 - 00:44:58.208, Speaker A: It's been a real pleasure to see kind of the feedback from the show, from last week's episode, from the first episode. So please keep it up, everybody who's listening, and I'll see you guys all again next week for another.
00:44:58.256 - 00:44:59.324, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:44:59.624 - 00:45:00.884, Speaker B: Thank you for having us.
00:45:02.064 - 00:45:04.644, Speaker A: Bye, guys. Bye.
