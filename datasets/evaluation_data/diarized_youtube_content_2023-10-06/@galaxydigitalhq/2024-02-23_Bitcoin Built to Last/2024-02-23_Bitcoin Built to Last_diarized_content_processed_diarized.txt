00:00:07.960 - 00:00:12.334, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.454 - 00:00:13.674, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.974 - 00:00:47.484, Speaker A: So, you know, bitcoin, I guess, is technically flat a little bit, although what we did earlier this week hit a yearly high of like nearly 53k. But now we're back in the 51 range. I mean, it's basically the same range. We've been over 50 for nine consecutive days. Ether has outperformed a little bit in the last week or two, but still, I would say below where it was the last time bitcoin was at 50k. So still also kind of in its range in the scheme of things. So not a ton of news, crypto, major price action wise, since we last spoke.
00:00:47.484 - 00:00:50.764, Speaker A: Is that your view of the crypto markets at the moment?
00:00:51.184 - 00:01:41.674, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I would tell you that the price action we've seen over the past week is incredibly constructive. What you're seeing is an asset class maturing in front of your face. Basically, the ETF volumes have started to materially go higher. You've had consistent inflows, dips have been bought, and in ethics, less institutional right now. But I think what's capturing folks with respect to ETH is just the broader crypto narrative around tokenization stablecoins. I can't tell you the amount of meetings that I'm just getting pulled into about this different effort, that other effort.
00:01:41.674 - 00:01:58.958, Speaker B: It seems like now, you know, people have finally realized that it's here to last. It's not like some fad where some bank or whatever random firm like for a year invests in it, and then the next year it's like, oh yeah.
00:01:59.046 - 00:02:02.294, Speaker A: They do innovation theater, which I used to call it. No, it seems more durable.
00:02:02.334 - 00:02:28.929, Speaker B: Now that is exactly how I describe it. It seems much more durable. And I think that makes folks very excited for where ETH is going to, to be on a go forward basis. And then I genuinely think three k is a big level. It's the highest level ETH has been at in April 22, basically. And there's lots of good reasons for it. Eigen layer has been really constructive.
00:02:28.929 - 00:02:30.249, Speaker B: Bitcoin's been doing well.
00:02:30.321 - 00:02:33.313, Speaker A: There's high beta wealth effects, restaking situations.
00:02:33.353 - 00:02:35.753, Speaker B: Yeah. Supply that's getting staked.
00:02:35.833 - 00:02:52.554, Speaker A: It's been, I would point out too, I think our audience will know this. But I mean, bitcoin is, I would say, more predictably scarce certainly than ETH. But ETH has been basically flat supply for years now. So it's also scarce is my point. So demand increases it can.
00:02:52.714 - 00:03:38.746, Speaker B: But the other thing is just the culture of asset allocation. In the US, people just buy and hold. Normally in equity world in fixed income, part of it's one, if you sell something that's a taxable event, but two, a lot of people invested in stuff to hedge themselves for fee at the basement. People are always afraid of that. Anyway, with ETH, you've had a ton of bag holders that just haven't sold through many cycles. And I'd say the underperformance of ETH relative to bitcoin, you can assign some of it to just how much was in bankruptcy estates. Celsius was selling a ton and you could see it on chain every day.
00:03:38.746 - 00:04:11.554, Speaker B: So there was always all this supply. But now that's kind of cleared up a little bit and it looks like an asset that's just run out of sellers and you have a bit of marginal flow and markets that get set at the margin and there are tactical guys and crypto native hedge funds, et cetera, playing for swings here and there. But broadly, ETH is in the big asset game now. You know, with, with bitcoin and what do people do? They just buy, hold, accumulate, and there's tons of ETH, maxis, et cetera, for sure. Big community money and all of that.
00:04:11.594 - 00:04:14.450, Speaker A: They have interesting technology narrative with the l two s, really got a story.
00:04:14.482 - 00:05:01.898, Speaker B: It'S got a chart, their flows like it's trading well. And you know, I rarely allow myself to get there in terms. I'm moving on to bitcoin now, but, you know, I rarely let myself go there in terms of like, like right tail stuff, like the analysts on tv calling for 250 grand and a million bucks. I try to be a little bit more pragmatic about market expectations, but it's really hard not to think what the future value of bitcoin is going to be based on the current supply dynamics that we know about right now. In terms of just the flows we've had so far are exceptional. I would say at this point they weren't at the start. And that's without bitcoin.
00:05:01.898 - 00:05:09.058, Speaker B: ETF's being in all the platforms, without the distribution of the entire us wealth.
00:05:09.106 - 00:05:12.774, Speaker A: Management platforms, banks, burger dealers, etcetera.
00:05:13.194 - 00:05:42.540, Speaker B: I think you're just at the tip of the iceberg with respect to how far reaching this ETF product is going to be. And to go along with that, you have the supply of the happening, literally. Supply is going to come down. It just seems like one of those things that's just always going to have marginal buyers and really not that much in terms of sellers. It could be speculators selling, et cetera.
00:05:42.732 - 00:05:46.028, Speaker A: One of the other this year questions has been rates.
00:05:46.156 - 00:05:46.996, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:05:47.100 - 00:06:12.836, Speaker A: We know we have the halving. I love your point about the advisor platforms. Not even, I mean we've said this over the last couple of weeks, but like frankly surprised, obviously, happily surprised with the volumes and inflows that we've seen in the ETF's even before this main market for them comes online. That's just great. That just makes me even more bullish. And that's a major one. The catalyst of various large bank or broker dealer wealth management platform turning on bitcoin.
00:06:12.836 - 00:06:57.590, Speaker A: ETF's is going to be a drip, drip, drip that you hear over the next twelve to 18 and 24 months. But the halving is a big narrative event. And I had been, I've always been of the view, especially this is what happened in 2020, right? Was the monetary easing, historic, arbitrary, crazy levels the same time that bitcoin, credible, neutral, predictable tightens you had been for a while in the fall and earlier this year it looked like the same dynamic was going to happen. Obviously the easing that we're expecting is not nearly what happened in COVID, but that arbitrary human design to control rate cuts and maybe, maybe balance sheet runoffs and easing would occur at the same time as the having again, now we're going to have the having. It looks like rate cuts won't happen at that time, right?
00:06:57.702 - 00:06:59.790, Speaker B: Most likely May or June will be the first.
00:06:59.822 - 00:07:30.574, Speaker A: Well, if it's May, that's still kind of right there. I mean we're looking at April 20 or 19th for the having. But my question is, are you surprised to see bitcoin's performance in the face of what fed funds rate at five and a quarter? Rates are so high, bitcoin's almost at all time highs. One, do we need cuts? Two, is it better to have them sooner or later? Because I was thinking maybe even later is better since it's doing great with adhesive, it gives it a second shot. What are your thoughts on that timing and stuff?
00:07:30.614 - 00:08:03.978, Speaker B: Oh yeah. So in terms of one, does the economy need cuts? And that's up for debate. The current data says you don't need them. Right. Employment's incredibly contained or low and prices, there's still upside risk to inflation, at least as far as we can tell right now. And so it's really up for debate. I tell you the best logic for cutting is that stuff has normalized and you are at restrictive levels and you're let's say 200 basis points above restrictive.
00:08:03.978 - 00:08:48.910, Speaker B: So if your policy objectives are met, you want to get to neutral and you're not at neutral, and then your risks are. If you think your risk is more tilted towards a hard landing or unemployment ticking higher, then you should probably start cutting before that turn happens. And so that's the logic with rate cuts. And I think it's going to be an important driver for markets. But I tell you, the scenarios are already like baked in to a certain extent. We've gone from a market that prices in seven cuts to closer to three, four, and you've kind of established that range. And so if you go back to pricing and a lot more cuts, that's probably going to be because the economy has turned.
00:08:48.910 - 00:09:49.468, Speaker B: And maybe stocks will do well in that environment. They most likely will because they do well in any environment, it seems like right now, but that's kind of where you are. I'd say the bigger thing for me in terms of monetary policy that I think hits home even more with respect to bitcoin is the balance sheet management. If we live in a world where everybody is forced to recognize the fact that we are basically not going to be able to reduce the balance sheet at a certain point, and that ultimately, because of the fiscal situation, that the balance sheet has to be ever expanding on a go forward basis. Like the moment where we're just like printing money to buy our own debt, to go spend money on social programs, any type of program, any program whatever. And it's like, it's just that I think will kind of drive the message home about fiat, the basement, right?
00:09:49.556 - 00:09:53.224, Speaker A: It's perpetual and inevitable in this current system.
00:09:53.994 - 00:10:08.082, Speaker B: I couldn't have said it better myself. I mean, yeah, perpetual and inevitable. And so it's a matter of time before that happens. And I think that balance sheet policy shift is kind of what I'm more focused on.
00:10:08.098 - 00:10:14.522, Speaker A: So that might be the second shot when we really, it's both when we see it, but also when it becomes understood that that's what's going to happen.
00:10:14.578 - 00:10:47.348, Speaker B: But at the end of the day, I could tell you that macro markets are the most important thing. And if Nasdaq crashes 5%, bitcoin will crash 5%. That stuff is mostly true. But I think you really have to think about bitcoin in isolation. And there's a whole investor base that wasn't able to get access before. That is just getting access. Markets move at the margin, and if there are going to be more marginal buyers than sellers on a consistent basis for bitcoin, the price needs to go a lot higher, and that's kind of where we're at.
00:10:47.348 - 00:11:04.940, Speaker B: And you could talk to people on either end of the monetary policy spectrum, and I don't think it would sway you on where bitcoin prices are headed. I've talked to macro guys that are super hawkish and super dovish, but most of them are pretty bullish bitcoin, and they wish they had more.
00:11:05.012 - 00:11:09.204, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. Well, Bim Netabeebe, my friend from Galaxy trading, as always, thank you so much.
