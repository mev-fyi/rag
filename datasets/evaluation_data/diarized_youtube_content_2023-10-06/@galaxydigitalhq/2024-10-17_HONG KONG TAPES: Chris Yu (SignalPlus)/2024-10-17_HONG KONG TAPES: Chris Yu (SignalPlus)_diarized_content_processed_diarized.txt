00:00:00.720 - 00:00:02.193, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:02.289 - 00:00:03.805, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash.
00:00:04.385 - 00:00:10.961, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin meeting new, all time high.
00:00:11.113 - 00:00:11.985, Speaker B: If you're not long.
00:00:12.065 - 00:00:13.697, Speaker C: If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.881 - 00:00:20.393, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin.
00:00:20.489 - 00:00:22.205, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto out there.
00:00:22.865 - 00:00:24.845, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:26.355 - 00:01:02.615, Speaker C: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. And we have another great episode from the Hong Kong tapes interviews that I did with folks at Galaxy's headquarters in Asia in Hong Kong last month. In September this time I'm talking with Chris Yu from Signal plus about the bitcoin options market, the need for tooling to support advanced trading, and the future of on chain structured products. It's a fascinating interview. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:04.035 - 00:01:09.243, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Chris Yu, co founder and CEO of Signal Plus. Chris, welcome to Galaxy Brands.
00:01:09.379 - 00:01:10.667, Speaker B: Thank you, thank you.
00:01:10.851 - 00:01:28.295, Speaker A: I was excited to talk with you. We met a few days ago. We're here in Galaxy's Hong Kong headquarters. Signal plus is really advanced software for options traders that I guess you were saying is relatively common in traditional finance, but missing in crypto. What is it?
00:01:29.195 - 00:02:19.909, Speaker B: I wouldn't say it. I mean, it's really common in Chi Fi that every bank, every trading firm have their own system. But then it's very common that all the system are built 30 years ago. I mean, as a new generation trader, we always want the software or the system to be more user friendly, more efficient. But for the banks to change their system is almost impossible because like the tech team has turned over every year. New newcomers will always feel it difficult to change the original codes of the system and therefore the system become, I mean, it's super accurate, super stable, but it's never really efficient and user friendly. And crypto actually offers a good opportunity for us to do something that, I mean, it's commonly accepted by the traders, but in better format.
00:02:19.909 - 00:02:23.345, Speaker B: But then crypto doesn't have anything of that when we come to the market.
00:02:23.805 - 00:02:38.877, Speaker A: Interesting. So instead of ripping out the bank software and trying to do it, you have an opportunity to start from scratch maybe then and build it fresh. Right. I mean I worked at Fidelity Investments for 12 years. I know how hard it can be to build new technology inside of a giant firm. So is that. But.
00:02:38.877 - 00:02:41.647, Speaker A: But it also doesn't exist at all really in cryptos. Right?
00:02:41.711 - 00:03:10.115, Speaker B: Exactly. So we started from that idea. So that comes to our first products to basically build a professional trader based, I mean trader oriented trading software for risk management for execution. But later on we move on, try to build something that doesn't exist in Trife either. We try to build something new for only crypto because crypto is 724 and a bit different from Trife asset class as well.
00:03:10.515 - 00:03:37.175, Speaker A: So I like this. Very interesting. Options have grown huge. I don't have the data in front of me at the moment but I mean open interest on Deribit for example is maybe an order of magnitude higher than just a few years ago. So what is everyone doing now? If you're a big options trader or shop, you build your own tools. They all have some rudimentary tools they've built to handle their risk and monitor. No one's selling this as software to them yet.
00:03:37.685 - 00:04:24.997, Speaker B: I think for the toolset there are some players in the market, but we are also one of the earliest one. But the way that we operate the software, although we sell the tools, is actually slightly different from a traditional way of selling a SaaS system. We don't really charge the user, we don't really charge a fixed fee for the SaaS system. The way we look at this is actually very related to your first point about option volume being grown. When we come to the market, we think option markets is literally too small compared to where the spot futures and perpetual is. But then in FX and equity we have seen that growth. We have seen that option as 1% of a spot trading or linear trading like 15 years ago in FX but then now it's almost at par.
00:04:24.997 - 00:04:40.783, Speaker B: But then the same number in equity. Option is actually bigger than linear products. But right now, I mean when we come to the market the option is only 0.5% of the linear stuff. I think over the past few years option has grown like three, four times. So right now we are 2 to 3% still. But still it's very small number.
00:04:40.783 - 00:05:13.315, Speaker B: That's also why we designed the software into a volume based revenue. We don't want to anchor our revenue with the number of user. So I say we charge each user 2k per month like Bloomberg. We don't want to do that anymore. So we want to Offer like free service for the user. Whenever you trace rust, we actually want to get a commission or rebate from the exchange so that we can capture the crypto option beta. Whenever the volume grows 100 times, our revenue can grow 100 times, our user might not grow 100 times.
00:05:13.315 - 00:05:15.235, Speaker B: As long as we have bigger users.
00:05:15.275 - 00:05:34.453, Speaker A: Like you guys, that makes sense. You're coming in. Then you can ride the wave that you also help to build by maturing the market. Okay, so tell me before we go further, tell me why you chose to leave traditional finance and get into crypto and then eventually build Signal Plus.
00:05:34.629 - 00:06:26.021, Speaker B: Well, I would say as a trader you always try to trade the most volatile or you always try to chase the volatility at the bank. At the end of the day, after you become more experienced, you will always be a little bit conservative. You always have to really consider a lot of politics in the big system and then that all coming back reflecting your trading decision making process. And then you actually start to have some extra time because you actually can look at other stuff that you can make more of your own decision making. That's where I started to look at crypto trading. So I started to trade my pa. I started to look at the market but then I realized oh, this is the asset class back in 2022 with the implied volatility at 120 this, which is amazing.
00:06:26.133 - 00:06:37.325, Speaker A: So I see, so you were attracted to the volatility as a trader. Crypto was very volatile. So you started trading it and then I guess you realized you didn't have the tools you needed.
00:06:37.445 - 00:07:00.017, Speaker B: Exactly. So I started to trade very small. Honestly, I didn't even know how to buy crypto asset. I actually asked my friend to a P2P to get some crypto asset as a collateral and put on derby. I started trade, I trade made like 15 times in the one month's time. And then I started to take it more serious. To be honest that 15 times largely because I'm lucky, I'm actually highly leveraged.
00:07:00.017 - 00:07:51.905, Speaker B: But after that I start to look at a little bit more serious and start to say hey, how can I scale up? And when I try to scale up, I had to really guess a lot of scenarios and what kind of a circumstance, what's my game plan? I don't have the right tool. So I wish I had a tool that I had in my FX trading in Goldman and Morgan Stanley. But then I realized that there is no such tool in the market. So I start to basically evaluate to be to set up a hedge fund in crypto options space or to set up infrastructure or software company or in crypto I realized if I go to set up like a hedge fund back then in 2021, if you are a crypto option focused fundamental, your AUM probably is less than 50 million. That's the capacity. If you try to run a hedge fund with AUM less than 50 million, it's not really that sexy to me.
00:07:51.985 - 00:07:55.665, Speaker A: It's not economical? Well, it could be, but it's small, right?
00:07:55.705 - 00:07:56.337, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:56.521 - 00:08:03.041, Speaker A: And so the market and the infrastructure couldn't support like a larger sized fund, is that what you're saying?
00:08:03.233 - 00:08:38.315, Speaker B: Yes. I mean it's a little bit the chicken and egg because to build an option infrastructure or at least to build the tools, it's actually something pretty heavy. If you want to have a proper software or tools not like Excel based, it probably takes you like around 10 to 20 people originally to build it for one to two year. But the landscape for trading firm in crypto is very different from Trifi. There are so many trading firm has five to 10 people. They used to be ranking top market maker exchange. And then if you do a you do, you do an interview with them, they tell you they only have five people.
00:08:38.315 - 00:08:48.243, Speaker B: But then for this type of people it's generally just impossible for them to build some in house option system and therefore they cannot really scale and they.
00:08:48.259 - 00:09:03.307, Speaker A: Don'T do options then at scale. I see, I see. Because you do need like software tools and real time risk management and then that's interesting. So okay, so instead of running one you said you'll build software to help them run.
00:09:03.371 - 00:09:32.295, Speaker B: So once we started to identify we want to build the infrastructure, I started to look at why crypto option hasn't grown. What's the pinpoint? So I realized there are three pinpoint which ended up to be our three products. The first one as we just discussed is a software for professional trader to scale up their trades. So that one is like quite straightforward. The second one is we realize crypto is 724. You don't have enough electronic market maker in the market. Especially if extreme case happens.
00:09:32.295 - 00:09:58.875, Speaker B: Look at derby other book. I mean on a daily basis it's perfect. It's liquidity is pretty enough and markets pretty deep as well. But when markets in this extreme case nobody's throwing price, it tells you that we don't have enough market maker. I mean then I start to do some homework. In the FX market you have 50 to 100 banks making market for this. But then in crypto, I mean there are a lot of market makers.
00:09:58.875 - 00:10:13.343, Speaker B: But then most of them are more like OTC market maker or blockchain electronic market maker. I think the time when we come to the market is maybe less than 7, which is generally not enough. So the second product we try to build is market making infra.
00:10:13.519 - 00:10:16.879, Speaker A: I see. So make it easier to enter as an electronic market maker in the options space.
00:10:16.927 - 00:10:18.087, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly.
00:10:18.191 - 00:10:19.383, Speaker A: And then the third product.
00:10:19.439 - 00:10:39.605, Speaker B: The third product is try to build a taker flow. So we think about the market. Okay. We have professional users, we enable more market makers and then what we need is the taker flow. In traditional finance. Again, this is something that we have seen it in the past 20 years which has happened in FX and equity market. The biggest taker flow is structured products.
00:10:39.605 - 00:11:05.415, Speaker B: Because we had the market making infra. We make customization to that. We can actually make this customized automation tool for structure products. But then this part we basically serve the different user. We serve the issuers differently from the market making infra. The structured product thing we only sell to the biggest issuers which are mainly the exchange right now for our audience.
00:11:05.455 - 00:11:11.887, Speaker A: Who may not know explain what a structure product is. Right. And how options fit into that.
00:11:11.951 - 00:11:46.263, Speaker B: Sure. Structure product. I mean probably we don't need to understand the backend how the structure is how the product is structured out. But then you can see this is basically a basket of option that helps you to boost your Yield from Treasury 5% to 15 to 20% yield. This is very common in traditional finance and it become the most common way of yield enhancement instrument. But at the end of the day it all become option taker flows to the option desk at investment bank. So to.
00:11:46.263 - 00:12:09.463, Speaker B: I would say to like prime broker user or to a retail user, a structured product is more like a yield enhanced products. It can be principle protected or not. But at the end of day it wraps up option so that the user can easily understand the payout without need to look at the details of what options in that.
00:12:09.519 - 00:12:30.041, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's a very generalized term structured product. But it is basically right. And correct me if this summary is wrong. It's basically like. Well, there might be a variety of strategies embedded inside. What we're saying is you put in X dollars and it will is predicted to yield this much over X amount of time or not or. Or protect you this much or whatever.
00:12:30.041 - 00:12:46.575, Speaker A: But it's to. To get that the option, the product itself is performing options strategies that you. You're sort of saving the user from having to hire a whole options desk to figure out to run multiple strategies combine them into some predictable. It's like an ETF almost for options.
00:12:47.075 - 00:12:47.883, Speaker C: It's a wrapper.
00:12:47.939 - 00:12:57.451, Speaker B: Exactly. It always set up some scenarios for the user. It will tell you if the BTC is always 50k above you got 40% APY something like that.
00:12:57.483 - 00:12:58.507, Speaker A: Right, right, right, right.
00:12:58.611 - 00:13:01.403, Speaker B: If it goes below 50k you may lost some principle.
00:13:01.459 - 00:13:23.349, Speaker A: Right, right. Whatever it is. And you can structure them in almost. I think it makes sense why you know the sell side likes this because you can hear the desire from the client and then just put your smart options people on. How do we design a strategy that could get that and then what are the. You know, where do we have to. What is the risk in that? You know, if I say you know, I want 5.1%
00:13:23.349 - 00:13:32.719, Speaker A: it's going to be a much different structured product than if I say I'm looking for 40%. Right. And with different risk and whatever. But you can package them as like individually sellable products.
00:13:32.807 - 00:13:59.931, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean that's the exactly right way of think about the structure product. Because in traditional finance how this product designed is actually dependent on the end user. The end user are generally more of the insurance companies or the real money investors in the market. Taking the insurance company as example. A lot of them has been selling the life insurance like 20 years ago at a cost of 7 to 8% when the interest rate was high. But then that becomes the cost of insurance company.
00:13:59.931 - 00:14:39.589, Speaker B: That means their target return should be at least 8% so that they can break even. So when that's how investment bank design the products. But now in crypto it's so easy to design a product that actually have a return more than 8% which is why I'm very bullish on this market because with ETF approved and actually just this week SEC also approved BTC option on ETF to be traded. So once we have that we can already see start to see structural product on. On crypto with the implied volatility so high then this real money will love the products and then there will be huge demand which is taker flow.
00:14:39.677 - 00:15:00.993, Speaker A: That's interesting. So again why you had were chasing volatility as a trader it there's things you can do with that volume. Right. I want to ask to you what about you had said to me that you were maybe we don't call it a product. There's a project that you've incubated around structured products. What is that?
00:15:01.089 - 00:15:52.213, Speaker B: So we realized there are a bit of a barriers about distribution the structured product. As I mentioned right now the biggest issuer is always the exchange. But then the exchange the way that they try to design the products as not always the way that the user would want. And then one thing that we like crypto is, I mean our blockchain is it really can do something on the blockchain and in a decentralized way. And after FTX happened I think the market is actually missing some central counterparty that can take the counterparty risk that everyone can take as a counterparty where the blockchain naturally is actually the kind of party everyone can trust. Right. Because it's transparent, it's actually efficient for settlement.
00:15:52.213 - 00:16:26.913, Speaker B: Because think about the way that we do settlement in the ops department in the bank it's always manual. I need to send down the fixing at 4pm and sometimes it mess up. But then if everything is right in the smart contract, it's actually quite straightforward. So we actually incubate a project called SOFA that actually settles the first step only settles structured products. Second step will settle loan deposit and also derivatives later. But the first step is we allow user to deposit the asset on chain. Everything is in smart contract and the smart contract is audit.
00:16:26.913 - 00:16:37.125, Speaker B: But then your asset is safe basically. And then you can buy a structure product and everything is written in a smart contract automatically settled and plug in market makers.
00:16:37.515 - 00:16:52.227, Speaker A: Does it need like on chain options or do other parties come in from off chain like not traditional crypto market maker? Does it rely on only on chain defi applications to go inside the structure product?
00:16:52.371 - 00:17:32.205, Speaker B: Not really. I mean at the very beginning of course if you don't pick up the products that has higher capital efficiency then that will make the market maker or the user capital efficient super low. But out of all the products there are actually some products that can be high capital efficiency for both buyer and seller. So we pick up those products, we let the blockchain to settle that. It's not dependent on the centralized, it's not dependent on the decentralized defi option space because there's no liquidity there. The market maker because it's high capital efficiency. The market maker can use small collateral to be a market maker for the structure products using SOFA protocol.
00:17:32.205 - 00:17:35.265, Speaker B: But at the same time they can use their bid for hedging.
00:17:35.565 - 00:17:40.021, Speaker A: I see, I see. So it's really about the counter the settlement of the products in the first.
00:17:40.053 - 00:17:42.253, Speaker B: Place, not the clearing and settlement.
00:17:42.349 - 00:17:56.101, Speaker A: Yeah. Not the execution of the constituent strategies that are in there. That's very interesting. We don't have that in crypto yet. I haven't. I mean to be honest, it's called Sofa I haven't heard. I mean I'm not the expert on defi but I haven't heard of structured products on chain.
00:17:56.173 - 00:18:40.773, Speaker B: Yeah, it has been actually the data has been doing pretty well. The so far project has been live since June. It has a TVL. It has a TVL 20, 30 million immediately right after its launch. I mean it's actually ranking like number two, number three on DeFi llama in terms of options space already honestly by we incubate it, it's naturally growing by itself. So far that the data actually shows on chain there are active user try to deploy. We actually see very big, I would say very big asset managers coming to us say hey do you guys want to design this product? I'm okay to deploy like 30 million TVL.
00:18:40.773 - 00:19:07.031, Speaker B: Think about that. This already become an area where you can, once you have the smart contract ready, you can use that as clearing a settlement because everything is on smart contract. And then we can bridge this up. We can basically go back to this asset manager say hey now I can have the products. We already have a market maker for example, we take Galaxy into this space as well. Then you guys can be the market maker, they can be the buyer. Everything settled down chain, the asset is on the smart contract.
00:19:07.031 - 00:19:42.117, Speaker B: So this, this is I mean one of the potential way where structured product can take off. But taking the defi part aside, I mean all the regulators has been actively trying to push the structure product forward as well. Including Hong Kong and Singapore. We start to see some initiatives already from the regulators and also of course from the market participants who always want to push this forward. But then I do believe even the attitude are positive but the process might be slow. So the first step might be still the on chain part.
00:19:42.301 - 00:20:22.993, Speaker A: Very interesting. So maybe stepping back just broadly, you're in the options space. I mean you've talked, we've talked, we sort of talked a little bit about like how whether trading professional trading desks or options focused hedge funds may use it. But in general like where is the demand? You've tweaked my interest about say traditional insurers needing yield and wow, there's a lot of volatility here. But in general, who, what types of strategies are people doing in options today? You know, what types of, you know, options traders are there, right? I mean is it's not all, you know, prop shop head or hedge funds, right? Who else is doing that? You see like, or what types of.
00:20:23.009 - 00:20:59.553, Speaker B: Strategies are they doing actually? So besides all the hedge fund players who are using option to do some Leverage or trading Vol as asset class we start to actually see more and more players to do A hedging and B yield enhancement. Exactly. Starting from second half year this year. So I think this year could be the turning point for option market to explosively grow into next year. So that's why I mean I mentioned that the implied wall was 120 when I come to the market currently the implied wall of bitcoin is around 56 already.
00:20:59.649 - 00:21:00.657, Speaker A: Right. So it's much lower.
00:21:00.681 - 00:21:43.295, Speaker B: Yeah, it's much lower. It tells you that more participants for sure about why more participants means more lower. It's actually because a BTC market become deeper, liquidity become better and the underlying asset is less volatile as a fundamental but then at the other hand is with more participant in option space generally people will try to sell the war to do the yield enhancement. Right. So what we are missing here in the market is we start to see some hedgers say hey I have 10,000 bitcoin, I want to buy some put to protect. So we start to have that flows we didn't see a lot like two years ago. I mean I almost see zero before.
00:21:43.295 - 00:22:32.305, Speaker B: This part I think can grow bigger with all this passive holders come to place. The only reason they haven't come in to this place is BTC doesn't have yield. So a very like a natural way of thinking this is if I have let's say BTC have a deposit rate of 5% just like a fiat, okay. If I have a 5% yield I allocate some of my asset for this real money investors to bitcoin then I'm willing to spend 1% as a hedge because the market is moving. So I spend 1% premium to buy puts and then I get 4% yield and I'm passively holding this as an allocation. So that's the way it works right now BTC doesn't have yield. So where the yield come from? Structure products.
00:22:32.685 - 00:22:33.141, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:22:33.173 - 00:22:40.625, Speaker B: So it's a step by step. Once you the structure product is widely adopt then you have yield. Once you have yield you want to hedge.
00:22:41.685 - 00:23:13.211, Speaker A: It's very interesting and yes I think selling Vol is so this is primarily people selling calls right. Like collecting premium. That's yield enhancement as you said. Right. And I can see this is one of the big things I think with the ETF options and there's already a big options market but there are a lot of probably like you said real money investors who prefer to trade CFTC regulated options or options that are their normal brokerage and prime brokerage can actually touch. Right. Is that, that should enhance it.
00:23:13.211 - 00:23:25.545, Speaker A: So that should over time also contribute to Bitcoin realize Vol coming down. Right. So that's, that's. Is that essential for the growth of the asset class in your mind or if Bitcoin as an asset.
00:23:25.665 - 00:23:57.795, Speaker B: I think that's very natural for an asset class to grow bigger. So because we have actually seen that in an FX market as well. So it used to be like 10 to 20 implied wall, right now it's only 3 to 5. That's actually because more participants market deeper liquidity become better. So I would say the current progress or development in crypto option has been pretty healthy. Everything has been showing that more participant in the market is more liquid and deeper and more healthier structure.
00:23:59.135 - 00:24:22.729, Speaker A: I think we're going to go some crazy places with this. This feels like much stronger footing, much more maturity than the 21, 22 era, much deeper institutional products. And I think just the option story is really just getting started. It seems like you guys are going to be on the sort of forefront of helping to push it forward.
00:24:22.857 - 00:24:51.021, Speaker B: Yeah, we are in very good position and very committed position. Try to a grow the volume together through three of products. Professional, user, maker and taker at the same time. We are very committed to make educational stuff to users. Basically two perspective. One is whoever are trading crypto actively doesn't understand option. We have all the materials to tell them what is option.
00:24:51.021 - 00:25:14.305, Speaker B: And if you are big users we can also find some good market maker like you guys to quote them a price when they want to participant.

So these users naturally they can come to crypto because the implied wall is super high. Just the same reason as when I move over.
