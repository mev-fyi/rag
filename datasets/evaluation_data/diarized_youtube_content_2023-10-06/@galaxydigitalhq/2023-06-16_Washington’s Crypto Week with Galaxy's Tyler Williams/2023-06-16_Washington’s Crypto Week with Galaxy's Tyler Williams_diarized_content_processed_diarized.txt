00:01:00.244 - 00:01:36.844, Speaker A: Tyler Williams, our friend, head of public policy at Galaxy Digital, is our guest. We're going to talk at length with Tyler about the House Financial Services Committee hearing politics in Washington around crypto and generally. It's a great and timely conversation. Of course, we'll also check in with our good friend bin at a baby from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk about markets and macro big fed decision this week. A hawkish pause, so to speak. It's a great conversation, as usual. Before I get involved that I need to remind you to please refer to link to disclaimer on the podcast notes, and note that none of the information contained in this podcast represents investment advice or an offering, recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:36.844 - 00:01:47.536, Speaker A: Yo, Phineas, I like this beat, man. This is going to be a good episode. So let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnett, great to have you on.
00:01:47.600 - 00:01:48.600, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:48.712 - 00:02:02.614, Speaker A: I'm not going to do our little shtick here, but yes, it was Fed day today. Super bowl big day. So. But I'm going to. I'll break the news. This was the first pause of the cycle. No rate hike today.
00:02:02.614 - 00:02:06.534, Speaker A: What's the take here? I mean, what's going on?
00:02:06.874 - 00:02:50.284, Speaker B: Sort of they're sending conflicting messages. The idea that data is strong enough for them to think that they need to raise rates two more times this year, which is what was indicated in their dot plot, yet not strong enough to necessitate a hike. This meeting seems particularly odd. In addition, we did have pretty strong CPI yesterday, with core CPI coming in holding 5.3% year on year. You're still over 300 basis points above your core CPI target. You did have some soft PPI data this morning, but again, it's pretty clear the US is still well behind its inflation target.
00:02:50.284 - 00:03:06.832, Speaker B: And the Fed chose not to hike today. And I think at its face, you have like, actions speak louder than words. Right? And so just because they're telling you that they're gonna hike two more times, I don't necessarily think that they will actually hike those two more times.
00:03:06.848 - 00:03:13.392, Speaker A: That's so interesting. Cause if they were gonna hike two more times, why not do them now or start with one after those two?
00:03:13.448 - 00:03:36.250, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And we've also learned, I mean, the messaging of the Fed early on was that there's clear advantages to front loading. You want the bulk of your rate policy done sooner rather than later than drawing it out. This is a fed that went from being like, oh, front loading is really important to monetary policy. Works with a lag. We're going to pause. But here's the thing.
00:03:36.250 - 00:03:48.066, Speaker B: You also have to think about what other central banks did. The RBA took a pause. The Royal bank of Australia, the bank of Canada took a pause, and they have since had to hike again.
00:03:48.170 - 00:03:48.674, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:48.794 - 00:03:57.770, Speaker B: And you know, there may be more subsequent hikes. However, those curves were behind the US's, and US terminal is pretty high, but.
00:03:57.842 - 00:04:10.702, Speaker A: Pretty strange and different. Has there ever been a hiking cycle in the US where they paused and then hiked again, like a pause, as opposed to a cessation of hikes? Do we know?
00:04:10.838 - 00:04:17.782, Speaker B: Yes, but it's not common, man. This is not common. Typically, it's like you hike, you hike, you stop, and then you go for.
00:04:17.798 - 00:04:18.714, Speaker C: It, and then you cut.
00:04:20.294 - 00:05:14.100, Speaker B: And that's what's indicated by all the crazy inversion and the curves and what that historically means and stuff. And so it is strange behavior. But the precedent was set by other central banks recently. And so it's not like crazy. It's just a little intellectually dishonest, I think, because if you were intellectually honest about the data set in front of you and what you've conveyed to the market in terms of what the market thinks, your response function is to data, then in theory, you should have gone. There's nothing about the labor market that says it's cracking uptick in initial jobless claims. One this cycle so far, and there's been 14 upward revisions in the labor data, and we printed 300,000 jobs last.
00:05:14.172 - 00:05:14.700, Speaker C: It is.
00:05:14.812 - 00:05:16.444, Speaker B: It is actually crazy.
00:05:16.604 - 00:05:24.812, Speaker A: And so it really is. It's a, I mean, we were talking about this, you and I, yesterday. Like, I would just, I would keep hiking. Like, why? Why are they not.
00:05:24.868 - 00:05:25.180, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:25.252 - 00:05:26.588, Speaker A: You know, but stocks are low.
00:05:26.596 - 00:05:27.308, Speaker B: But here's the thing.
00:05:27.356 - 00:05:31.684, Speaker A: The unemployment's still low. Like, but I guess they don't want to over hike.
00:05:31.764 - 00:05:33.508, Speaker B: You keep hiking, then it's like, then.
00:05:33.516 - 00:05:34.468, Speaker A: It gets worse than it should.
00:05:34.556 - 00:05:47.660, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, so financial conditions are really important. And right now, financial conditions in terms of where the Fed is most focused on is probably with respect to banking system stress or one of their main areas of focus.
00:05:47.732 - 00:05:48.196, Speaker A: That's true.
00:05:48.260 - 00:06:07.856, Speaker B: Right. And so the further you jack up front end rates, the more that the curve is going to invert, which, again, as we've talked about in past podcasts, it's just literally the worst thing that can happen to a bank balance sheet. They've got liabilities in the front end, assets in the back end. Cost of liabilities go up and their value of their assets go down.
00:06:08.000 - 00:06:08.924, Speaker A: It's bad.
00:06:11.944 - 00:06:32.836, Speaker B: Realistically, there's potential systemic consequences if they just keep going like this, although I think it's, it's probably less likely than it has been historically, like, or recently. Just look at things like the bank stock index, Kre. Those have rallied. People have stopped shorting bank stocks like crazy.
00:06:32.900 - 00:06:33.452, Speaker A: That was a wild thing.
00:06:33.468 - 00:07:02.624, Speaker B: In addition, bank deposits have kept up, and a lot of these small banks have changed their behaviors in order to adjust for this higher rate environment. Aka, we're going to offer everybody CDs at really high rates. Yeah. My deposits aren't going away. I'm just going to pay a lot of money for those deposits. And so their profitability is continuing to go down and down. However, the deposit issue and the solvency issue won't be there.
00:07:02.704 - 00:07:03.224, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:03.344 - 00:07:36.484, Speaker B: And the other thing to keep in mind is that a lot of this rates are going up, et cetera. But ultimately, monetary policy is meant to change the everyday person's life, right? The everyday person has to buy food and groceries. They gotta buy their apartment. Right. Or rent their apartment. And so, like, when we're thinking down to, like, the average man or woman level, right? Like, these high rates haven't really impacted them at all. Right? Grocery prices are still high.
00:07:36.484 - 00:07:53.056, Speaker B: They've come down. Electronics and things, there's spots, but inflation is still impacting that everyday person. And the only thing that's really gone down in value are, like, asset prices. Cryptos come down in value, like Nasdaq came off of bubble levels, went down a lot. Now is back at bubble.
00:07:53.120 - 00:07:53.776, Speaker A: That's what I was thinking.
00:07:53.800 - 00:08:17.138, Speaker B: But it's like commercial real estate. The things that are being impacted are assets, and particularly ones that are sensitive to interest rates. And who owns those assets? Not the average man. And so realistically, you could argue that there's still a lot of wood to chop with respect to getting inflation down for the everyday person.
00:08:17.186 - 00:08:17.826, Speaker A: That's what I'm thinking.
00:08:17.890 - 00:08:35.426, Speaker B: And the issue is it really comes down to the tightness in the labor market, which is there's a lot of job opening still, and not that many people have gotten laid off, and there's tons of mobility in the labor market, and that's not going to change for a really long time. And so it's tricky.
00:08:35.530 - 00:08:41.402, Speaker A: It is tricky. And I guess pausing then, I guess, can make sense, too. And that tricking, because it's tricky, they say, you know, yeah, it's possible.
00:08:41.458 - 00:08:42.494, Speaker B: Maybe we don't have to.
00:08:42.954 - 00:09:05.170, Speaker A: Maybe they're finally getting some prudence. Remember I used to call it whipsaw monetary policy. We were saying they cut faster and more quickly and printed more money than in all of history. And then, oh, crap, that was too much cutting and printing. Now we have crazy inflation. And then they waited too long to start hiking. And then it's like, well, if I say keep hiking now, maybe they'll have waited, too.
00:09:05.170 - 00:09:15.482, Speaker A: It'll actually get way worse. We'll have a hard landing because they'll have. Right. So maybe they're trying to just finally be prudent and just wait a little bit and how it feels like pragmatic. Pragmatic, not prudent. Yeah.
00:09:15.578 - 00:09:27.930, Speaker B: And yes, I think there's more nuance to the job than just looking at data and being like, oh, formulaically, my inflation's here, my policy rate has to be.
00:09:27.962 - 00:09:31.176, Speaker A: So there's like, they're sensing it. They've got their finger on the pulse.
00:09:31.330 - 00:09:58.212, Speaker B: That's in theory. That's what they told us that they're trying to do better at because they missed it on the other way. And so now they've been more dynamic about creating indices that aren't as lagging. The owner's equivalent rent used to be one of those big lagging indicators. They came out with a diffusion thing, et cetera. They've got all of these now casts Atlanta fed and New York Fed, the employment. So they're looking at a much broader set of data.
00:09:58.212 - 00:10:40.436, Speaker B: And they also have their own internal surveys, et cetera. So they are, in theory feeling the pulse of the market a bit better. The other thing I'd like to mention is that they need the market to give them credibility. That's one of the big reasons why I think they showed a 50 basis point increase in the dot plot for this year, is because they need people to think that interest rates are going to stay higher for longer. If you have these dramatic cuts priced into the back end of the curve, it's like, realistically, what are you actually doing? Because you start pricing those, you're not.
00:10:40.460 - 00:10:44.708, Speaker A: Really hiking because the market knows they're going to come down later, you kind of start pricing those in.
00:10:44.796 - 00:10:47.756, Speaker B: Right, exactly. It's one of those things where it's.
00:10:47.780 - 00:10:50.924, Speaker A: Kind of like we've talked about this before. They got to talk a tough game.
00:10:51.004 - 00:10:59.552, Speaker B: They have to. And that's just to implement the policy. Like there's, you know, for the smooth functioning amount, they have to raise the TGA and stuff.
00:10:59.608 - 00:10:59.936, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:00.000 - 00:11:06.664, Speaker B: Right. If like there's all this issuance, nobody's gonna want to buy paper that has all of these cuts priced into it. Right, right.
00:11:06.744 - 00:11:43.436, Speaker A: All right, so let's, let's talk, let's do a couple more. Just a minute or two left here. Let's talk about cryptos, obviously, and bitcoin, obviously. It's been basically flat all week. Right. I mean, down last weekend was a big, like, risk off for events, mostly for alts, but for crypto, I mean, a lot of alts were off 15 20%, and they haven't really recovered. But we had all those events on Tuesday, the court hearings, the binance court hearing, the house hearing, the coinbase, like sec response to their rulemaking petition stuff.
00:11:43.436 - 00:12:03.192, Speaker A: We covered all this, and I was tweeting about this all on Tuesday. In the end, most of that ended up being neutral for crypto. The pause shouldn't that, if pause means maybe cut sometime. We've said for a long time, we think that's bullish. Bitcoin. Bitcoin sitting at 25, eight. Again, we're just that, just below that long time channel, just where we were.
00:12:03.192 - 00:12:05.880, Speaker A: It seems flat. What's your outlook in the near term?
00:12:05.992 - 00:12:42.650, Speaker B: So generally speaking, when things are very confusing, lots of moving pieces, et cetera, I tend to look at the charts. Right. And our CEO has this saying, people lie, charts don't. And when I look at the charts, the most interesting one right now, unfortunately, is ETH. And ETH looks like it is breaking support right now. That support being in the range of like 1730 to 1750. And it's support that's held for the past three months, and you're getting like, closes below those support lines.
00:12:42.650 - 00:13:41.564, Speaker B: And to me, I don't see that many upside catalysts for ETH in the sense that where is the new money coming from to support ETH? A bunch of retail just got burned on some of these alts, and there's not a new meme coin popping off. You look at gas prices, they've come off, and then you look at the ETH BTC chart that looks like it starts trend lower. And so I really do think that you could be entering a period of ETH underperformance time. At the same time, on the bitcoin side, I think you're on the cusp of the macro argument being about as strong as ever. Because if we are going to go into a hard learning scenario and we're cutting rates again, or inflation is coming down and we're cutting rates again, risk assets have already started to jump, right. Nasdaq is close to the trend highs, S and P is close to the trend highs. It's one of those things that has no ambiguity about whether or not it is a security.
00:13:41.564 - 00:13:43.560, Speaker B: It is definitely a commodity.
00:13:43.592 - 00:13:45.408, Speaker A: It's the only one that is definitely.
00:13:45.536 - 00:14:19.172, Speaker B: And the way it trades is one of an asset class that has matured. It does not go down 20%. It goes down like a couple percent here and there. The volatility profile has improved in my eyes. And I think it's one that's going to perpetually continue to improve as you get more adoption, macro story improves, et cetera. There's gonna be a lot of buyers. I'll tell you, if bitcoin stayed here for the next six months in a row, just up and down a percent, the amount of money that would flow in, I think would be absurd.
00:14:19.228 - 00:14:19.916, Speaker A: That's great.
00:14:20.060 - 00:14:50.754, Speaker B: Cause the volatility, the volatility, the lower the volume, the more notional that people can fit in. And, yeah, I mean, it becomes one of those self fulfilling things. One of the things that is so discouraging about bitcoin, especially for the larger macro types, is like, this thing moves like crazy on next to nothing, what's going on, et cetera. The moment a lot of that goes away, I think that will draw a lot more new money into the system, myself included.
00:14:50.794 - 00:14:52.546, Speaker A: Much bigger. Money can be much bigger.
00:14:52.650 - 00:15:02.610, Speaker B: Much bigger, right? Like yards. Yards. And it's a market that doesn't like, I'm telling you, this market, if it had an influx of ten yards.
00:15:02.722 - 00:15:04.526, Speaker A: Yeah, pop it off.
00:15:04.630 - 00:15:05.726, Speaker B: I mean, oh, my God.
00:15:05.790 - 00:15:19.494, Speaker A: Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. My friend, as always, thanks so much for coming on. Galaxy brains. Thank you. Let's go to our friend Tyler Williams, Galaxy's head of public policy in Washington. Tyler, great to have you back on the show, as always.
00:15:19.654 - 00:15:21.754, Speaker C: Good to see you, Alex. Thanks for having me back.
00:15:22.254 - 00:15:55.984, Speaker A: It's always fun to talk with you, Tyler. And I think one of the first time we've talked a couple times, but one that I remember, and we talked during FTX week, I think you were our guest the week that FTX collapsed, and we were talking about how negatively this was going to impact sentiment in Washington. Of course, you were right. Fast forward. That was November 1 or second week in November. Now it's the middle of June. So more than six months later, where would you say sentiment stands in Washington on crypto?
00:15:56.484 - 00:16:44.796, Speaker C: In somewhat of a more precarious place. Only by virtue of a time lapse that has existed between win FTI happen then, if you look and remember about the sequential sort of timeline of things after that, we immediately went into the bank crisis and then the debanking issues. So time elapse has had a problem in terms of sort of overall sentiment for crypto policy in Washington. And it's just in Washington, things get airspace, and if it's not front and center above the fold, it's hard for it to get airspace. And things like chat GPT has that had their air quote, a real life use case moment in Washington. So there's just been other things that have shuffled into the mold. Plus we had the debt ceiling debacle.
00:16:44.796 - 00:17:28.024, Speaker C: And I think if you think about that, the chair of the financial services, McHenry, has consistently been tapped for different initiatives by his leadership. So Speaker McCarthy asked him to support and help him get through the speakership, and then he was in the midst of the banking issues, and then he was in the midst of, like, the debates and negotiations on the debt ceiling. So his agenda relative to the financial services committee and his work with the AG committee have been put on a little bit of a delay. So I would say all of those things, you know, get to a point of saying crypto policy has taken a backseat to other issues.
00:17:28.704 - 00:18:01.134, Speaker A: So. But would you say that sort of sentiment for doing the work? What about just the positive, negative view of crypto in Washington? Is it improved by virtue of some time passing, or is it the same. And maybe the malaise of not having as urgent a desire to work on policy on it has combined to make it slightly worse. What would you say? Is crypto stock rising or falling or is it flat in Washington?
00:18:01.294 - 00:18:13.674, Speaker C: It's a toss up. I think it's on daily. It's on a spot basis. Right. As we wish. We would have, like spot market structure regulation for the crypto space. It's the same sort of underwriting on a policy basis.
00:18:13.674 - 00:18:55.362, Speaker C: I think that we're in a, we're in a precarious moment because other ex us jurisdictions have taken more of a forceful lead. So the stock is rising in terms of action because people look at crypto policy and say, here other jurisdictions are doing stuff, we're at risk of losing the tech debate. We need to act because there are market participants. They're operating in the US with no certainty, and it's getting better elsewhere. So in the absence of us doing something, we're going to see the industry move elsewhere. So I think that it does resonate to some people. I'm not saying it resonates to all people because there's certainly some constituency that just doesn't care.
00:18:55.362 - 00:19:14.690, Speaker C: And if you look at Rep. Sherman, he says the same thing at every hearing. He talks about Shibu Ino and mongoose and whatever other coins, and then he says he just doesn't care. Like, we don't need to be the world's leader in crypto because he equates it to cocaine production.
00:19:14.762 - 00:19:21.084, Speaker A: I saw that. Yeah. You know what? Let's run that quick clip, that snappy clip from Brad Sherman. Thank you.
00:19:21.124 - 00:19:52.394, Speaker D: This seems like the 12th hearing we've had on crypto this year. I'm still waiting for a hearing on diversity, equity and inclusion in this room this year. But all these hearings seem to start with the idea that we're falling behind. America is behind Peru in cocaine cultivation. We are behind the Cayman Islands in nefarious, hidden, uh, financial transactions. We don't always need to catch up.
00:19:52.514 - 00:20:00.082, Speaker A: So, Brad, uh, Representative Brad Sherman from California, doesn't he represent Malibu? Is that, I think his district, I.
00:20:00.098 - 00:20:03.054, Speaker C: Can'T remember the exact congressional district somewhere around.
00:20:03.434 - 00:20:12.018, Speaker A: I think it's like North LA. And I mean, he's been one of our, I would say, most humorous and vociferous critics, I think, in Congress for a long time.
00:20:12.106 - 00:20:38.322, Speaker C: He's consistent in his beliefs. You have to give him credit for that. And you don't need to win everyone, you just need to win the majority. And like, that's the debates in Congress, like, they get very esoteric on specific issues. But at the end of the day, it's like simple fourth grade math. It's like, can you get to 60 votes in the Senate or can it get tucked into some other bill and can you have an execution moment where something can pass?
00:20:38.458 - 00:20:55.634, Speaker A: Yep. So let's talk on Tuesday of this week, there was a full committee hearing, a full committee of the House Financial services committee. It was titled digital assets. What? The future path of policy or something like that. I actually should have it in front of me. I'm embarrassed to ask.
00:20:55.674 - 00:21:00.298, Speaker C: The future of digital assets providing clarity for the digital asset ecosystem.
00:21:00.346 - 00:21:15.274, Speaker A: There we go. Thank you. This is a full hearing, and it was a big day on Tuesday. I'll mention a bunch of other things happened on Tuesday, but this was one of the reasons the guests were the witnesses who.
00:21:16.014 - 00:21:31.958, Speaker C: Big day in the financial services committee before that. Because Yellen testified. That's right. In the morning, right at that hearing. This is on the secretary's testimony on the state of the international financial system. And obviously, crypto and crypto policy comes up in the conversation.
00:21:32.006 - 00:21:32.902, Speaker A: What did she say?
00:21:33.038 - 00:22:02.190, Speaker C: Well, I think that the main tagline, which some of the Republicans, including the chair and the chair of the full committee and also the chair of the digital asset committee, French Hill, they referenced a couple of times in the hearing yesterday that Yellen explicitly said that, a, we need stablecoin legislation, a, they referenced the FSOC report, which, which treasury explicitly said that we need Congress to enact comprehensive market structure legislation for the sector.
00:22:02.302 - 00:22:04.798, Speaker A: That's interesting. So she's also pushing for that.
00:22:04.966 - 00:22:07.198, Speaker C: Speaker two. I mean, pushing for it.
00:22:07.246 - 00:22:07.646, Speaker A: Calling.
00:22:07.710 - 00:22:38.896, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know how much. I would say pushing. I would say that they wrote it. FSOC said it. So FSOC is an aggregate body of the chairs, of all of the dependent and independent financial regulators. So to the extent that there was a singular statement, which was similarly echoed in the president's executive order, you find yourself questioning why crypto policy is so much of an issue. If the president said that they wanted to do it, FSOC is saying that they need to do it.
00:22:38.896 - 00:22:52.864, Speaker C: And then you have the, what appears to be sort of a more significant bleed into just a pure partisan activity in Congress who's actually trying to enact progressive policy. It's so weird.
00:22:53.244 - 00:23:02.668, Speaker A: Yeah. If the president and the chairs of the treasury and FinCEN and the SEC and blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. And see the consumer speaker one, the.
00:23:02.676 - 00:23:05.052, Speaker C: Alphabet soup of the regulators, literally, they're.
00:23:05.108 - 00:23:27.538, Speaker A: They'Re a conglomerate body is also saying we need a bill and the Republicans are saying we need a bill. Who is opposing it? It's a wing of the Democratic Party that's particularly loud. Is that who's, currently, it's Senator Elizabeth Warren. Is that who's. Because they're arguing, along with chair gensler, that no legislation is required. Speaker one.
00:23:27.546 - 00:24:05.384, Speaker C: Yeah, it's some Venn diagram. And it's not all, it's not that all Democrats are opposed to the legislation. There's, there's certainly a healthy bipartisan bent to the legislation. No question about that. However, if you look at, if you look, let's just look just at the financial services committee. If you look at the upper dais, the senior Democrats on the financial services committee, they're raising all sorts of concerns with the market structure bill. They are in some forms balking at coming to a, a consensus deal on the stablecoin legislation.
00:24:05.384 - 00:24:35.566, Speaker C: And they're looking at the market structure bill saying, this is long. It's complicated. We're worried that crypto firms that are currently being sued and that are doing business through in the US are going to continue to potentially get this safe harbor through provisional registration that the bill has. And they're criticizing the commingling of customer funds and the protections that are in the bill. There's. And then Rep. Lynch, who's the subcommittee.
00:24:35.670 - 00:24:39.158, Speaker A: Vice chair, he represents Boston, Massachusetts.
00:24:39.206 - 00:25:10.818, Speaker C: Yeah, he's from Massachusetts. He's raising concerns. So I see that. And I say, is there an earnest effort to strike a deal? Because if one side's really interested in doing something and knows that the path to success requires democratic support, there's a deal and a negotiation to add. Nonetheless, I would say there are others like Rep. Torres and Rep. Nickel on the democratic side who are very supportive of advancing market structure legislation.
00:25:10.818 - 00:25:50.720, Speaker C: And I would say there are some that are looking at it and saying, I can get behind this if these certain concessions are made. And if you look at the tone and the tenor of Rep. Hines from Connecticut, what he was asking the other day, he was asking Quai Garrison, who used to be a counsel for Hester purse and is now a partner at Steptoe. He was asking him about the commingling provisions within the bill and whether or not they can be tightened up. So that's more in line with how I would consider questions, that if they're addressed and sufficiently addressed to the concerns, then maybe they can get behind.
00:25:50.872 - 00:25:51.296, Speaker A: Yep.
00:25:51.360 - 00:25:51.976, Speaker C: That's great.
00:25:52.080 - 00:25:53.204, Speaker A: That's good to hear.
00:25:54.114 - 00:25:56.082, Speaker C: Look at the AG committee.
00:25:56.258 - 00:25:56.826, Speaker A: Yep.
00:25:56.930 - 00:26:09.098, Speaker C: It's much more bipartisan than the financial services committee. To me, like, this is all just a question of, like, can the two committees produce this product they're trying to do between. It's a lot of work.
00:26:09.186 - 00:26:09.814, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:10.434 - 00:26:21.466, Speaker C: The provision, can they produce a bill that gets through both committees that can go to the House for and get more democratic support in the broader chamber?
00:26:21.650 - 00:26:22.146, Speaker A: What do you think?
00:26:22.170 - 00:26:24.334, Speaker C: I just don't know the answer to that. I think it's possible.
00:26:24.634 - 00:26:56.024, Speaker A: It's possible because of the earnest efforts, it seems like, of the chairs of both of the committees, the House Agricultural committee and the House Financial Service Committee and the ranking members. Right. And I think Chair McHenry was very gracious in thanking ranking member waters at the beginning of the hearing for conducting herself when she was chair in the prior Congress. Such a bipartisan effort. Looking at crypto, and it appears that he's trying to do something similar.
00:26:56.144 - 00:27:38.176, Speaker C: That's true. I think the difference is just politics on the stable coins, though. So if you were to look at stable coins, I would say senior New York Democrats focus on, like, a state role for stablecoin oversight because of bitlicense and NYDFs. So there's a pretty much no one else on the democratic side who's really focused on making sure that happens. And if you look at Velasquez and Meeks, like they have a vested interest in this to protect, like, New York prerogatives, that doesn't necessarily exist in the same fashion for the broader market structure efforts, which is why it appears a little bit more partisan.
00:27:38.320 - 00:27:51.736, Speaker A: So let's talk a little bit more in detail. There was something in the hearing yesterday that was really surprising. So the witnesses were Jeremy Lair, CEO, founder Circle. Right. The big stable coin issuer based in Boston. You mentioned Coy. What was coy's last name?
00:27:51.880 - 00:27:52.536, Speaker C: Garrison.
00:27:52.640 - 00:28:02.560, Speaker A: Coy Garrison, former counsel to Hester Purse, SEC commissioner, republican appointed SEC commissioner. And then who else was Thomas Sexton?
00:28:02.632 - 00:28:05.888, Speaker C: He's the president of the NFA, the National Futures association.
00:28:05.936 - 00:28:09.488, Speaker A: Which is what, the SRO for swap dealers or something? For futures?
00:28:09.656 - 00:28:12.864, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. They're an appointed independent SRO.
00:28:12.904 - 00:28:14.560, Speaker A: Kind of like FINra or something.
00:28:14.632 - 00:28:16.208, Speaker C: Kind of like Finro. Equivalent to the space.
00:28:16.256 - 00:28:22.320, Speaker A: Yeah. So semi regulator, but not a government agency. Yes. And then this other guy.
00:28:22.512 - 00:28:25.952, Speaker C: Well, yes. There was also the CEO and founder of Avilabs.
00:28:26.048 - 00:28:30.792, Speaker A: Oh, true. Amin gun Surrey, the founder, creator of Avax.
00:28:30.968 - 00:28:32.632, Speaker C: And Jeremy Lair was there. I don't know if you mentioned it.
00:28:32.648 - 00:28:47.554, Speaker A: I said him first. But I think Amin, honestly, probably the least interesting of the guests, given that this is more of a policy consideration. And he's a technologist, but. And then there was this guy. What is the name? Alan Kaplan. Yeah. Is that his name? He's the co CEO.
00:28:47.554 - 00:29:07.962, Speaker A: Aaron Kaplan. Aaron Kaplan. He was the co CEO of Promethean, a crypto asset broker dealer. That was what, a couple weeks ago, granted a license from the SEC to be a broker dealer for crypto asset securities. Right, right. And no one had ever heard of this company. I hadn't.
00:29:07.962 - 00:29:14.722, Speaker A: I've been covering the space since 2016. You hadn't heard of them? Right. I mean, we were looking into this.
00:29:14.738 - 00:29:19.354, Speaker C: I mean, I heard about at the same time, and I think you and I had a phone call or conversation about it.
00:29:19.394 - 00:29:20.090, Speaker A: Who are these people?
00:29:20.162 - 00:29:21.370, Speaker C: Yeah, right. Exactly.
00:29:21.482 - 00:30:11.312, Speaker A: And this is a really, to me, this was the most interesting, like substantive as opposed to sort of like qualitative or sentiment. Part of the hearing was this co CEO of Promethean, this new supposed crypto asset securities broker dealer, being grilled by many representatives. No one has heard. So before we get into that in depth, I want to point out also us senator from Alabama, Republican Tommy Tuberville, the day before, I believe, on Monday, had published an op ed in the Wall Street Journal criticizing Promethean and the SEC for giving them a license. And I guess revealing, I didn't know that. Again, this is a company no one really knows about, revealing that the company is significantly owned by CCP connected chinese.
00:30:11.368 - 00:30:15.000, Speaker C: Investors, 20%, according to Mister Kaplan.
00:30:15.192 - 00:30:44.594, Speaker A: And then, of course, the senator criticizing that from sort of a national security standpoint and criticizing the regulators for missing that and allowing chinese based owners to move in crypto, but not american ones, et cetera. So that's a little bit of the backdrop. But you know what? Let's run, let's run a clip. There was one. Who was it? Member Representative Flood. Representative flood grilled Promethean about some of this stuff. Let's run that clip.
00:30:45.094 - 00:31:30.304, Speaker D: I'd like to start by to read a question from a comment letter that Prometheum sent in response to the SEC's December 2020 special purpose broker dealer framework. The definition of a digital asset. Security, as used in the proposal, is a digital asset that meets the definition of a security under the federal securities laws. This definition puts a burden on the industry to determine which digital assets are securities. As a result, we believe the clarity is needed to understand the regulatory framework they must comply with, end quote. That was in a letter dated April 26 from Prometheum, specifically signed by Benjamin S. Kaplan, co CEO of the company.
00:31:30.304 - 00:32:43.884, Speaker D: I offer this into the record without objection. This concern which Promethium themselves raised in 2020 probably sounds familiar for those who track this committee closely. It is the exact same concern we've heard from witnesses in front of this committee before. How can a broker dealer register if they dont know which assets are a security and which are not? Further, it makes the same argument that other firms have made that the lack of clarity from the SEC puts an undue burden on the industry. Mister Kaplan, in your testimony you were very confident that no new legislation is needed in the digital assets space to clarify this question. What has changed between the date of this letter in 2021 and when your firm called for clarity? And now? What has changed over the two plus years since that time? There's been additional enforcement actions and statement by the SECs which have clarified any questions that we had in regards to the designation of a digital asset as a security. Mister Kaplan Prometheum's website says that Prometheum ATS supports, quote, many tokens that mostly trade on crypto crypto exchanges.
00:32:43.884 - 00:33:52.174, Speaker D: I'd like to dig in on that just a little bit. Can Promethium customers trade in ether? If your answer is yes, please explain how not currently can Promethium customers trade in bitcoin? If your answer is yes, please explain how no, just for the audience at home's benefit, ether and bitcoin make up more than 60% of the digital asset market. Mister Kaplan, given that either ether and bitcoin make up more than 60% of the digital asset market, if the current system is working, why can't your customers trade the most popular and widely used digital assets? Regulation and new ATS and custodians should take a crawl walk run approach and essentially they will proceed to add additional assets and abilities as time goes on. I'd like to point out when the I'm going to reclaim my time. Mister Kaplan, did Prometheum receive any additional exemptive relief from the SEC that has not been publicly shared?
00:33:52.474 - 00:33:53.214, Speaker C: No.
00:33:53.914 - 00:34:45.843, Speaker D: Thank you, Mister Kaplan Promethium's special purpose broker dealer license does not address the core issue. There is not a consistent definition of a digital asset security within current law. This point was made obvious when chair Gensler could not say definitively whether ether is a digital asset security when asked by chairman McHenry in this very room a couple months ago. In other words, that same question that Prometheum themselves raised in their 2021 comment letter is still unanswered. That's why legislation is needed. That's the problem that the chairman's bill works to solve. To testify in front of our committee, that your company's charter, which only allows for trading in a very small subset of assets, is evidence that no legislation is needed, just doesn't make sense.
00:34:45.843 - 00:34:57.723, Speaker D: If anything, the fact that Prometheum's customers cannot trade some of the most popular digital assets is an illustration of the broader problem. Mister Kaplan, I yield back.
00:34:58.494 - 00:35:07.566, Speaker A: Okay, so the clip, like, first of all, this representative, I mean, he must have been like a cop or a lawyer. Great interrogator. I was chuckling.
00:35:07.630 - 00:35:08.638, Speaker C: Did a very good job.
00:35:08.766 - 00:36:04.910, Speaker A: I mean, the question is, I think that a lot of the members had about this thing. Promethean is, what is the, is this a viable regulatory path? We all thought it seemed a little bit suspect, why, after all this time with the SEC not having approved or made a way for broker dealers to do crypto, like, how can we bring it all inside the regime if there's nowhere to trade it or custody it, right? And it seemed like this was an effort by the SEC to say, oh, look, there is somewhere we have let one through. Right? But then when interrogated, Mister Kaplan says, oh, yeah, you can't trade bitcoin there. You can't trade ETH there. It's like, what can you trade? I think there were a lot of members critical of this. I think, frankly, not in so many words, but really implying that this is like a charade, that this Promethean is sort of like a cutout, like a, like a fake broker dealer. Right.
00:36:04.910 - 00:36:10.542, Speaker A: Like mostly there for narrative, but not likely to be a viable path. Was that your takeaway?
00:36:10.678 - 00:36:33.914, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say there's two takeaways from the hearing. It was a, there wasn't. It's not a real viable path to actually trade the digital assets. Right. That's one. And then the second one was like this concern over China. And it's hard to express sort of the mood and sentiment in committees, but when Rep.
00:36:33.914 - 00:37:01.922, Speaker C: Luch Demeyer, who's a very important figure on the financial services committee, he's the chair of one of the subcommittees, and he's viewed as sort of like a senior thought leader on the republican side on the committee, and he's also on the China select committee, he was very specifically focused on, like, the chinese ownership of Prometheum. He was very explicitly focused on the PII and the data infrastructure and where.
00:37:01.938 - 00:37:03.282, Speaker A: Would the data be stored, et cetera.
00:37:03.338 - 00:37:20.004, Speaker C: What data protections, where it was stored, all that stuff. So I think that was, those were the two tones. But in the committee, when Rep. Luchteneier was asking these questions, everything was silent. And both on the republican side and the democratic side, everyone was focused. I know you see PAC.
00:37:20.164 - 00:37:23.332, Speaker A: You were there. You texted me. You said you could hear a pin drop.
00:37:23.428 - 00:37:37.860, Speaker C: Yeah, you could hear a pin drop when he was asking. Everyone's eyes were focused. And I think the one thing that has happened post President Trump is that both Republicans and Democrats are galvanized against China.
00:37:37.972 - 00:37:40.298, Speaker A: It's like one of the only bipartisan issues.
00:37:40.476 - 00:38:32.774, Speaker C: It certainly feels like that. Yes, absolutely. But I would also recommend for all the listeners, go read coy Garrison's testimony. He does a very good job of explicitly laying out how the special purpose broker dealer concept isn't a sufficient, sufficient solution. He lays out sort of the timeline that has existed since September of 2020, when the SEC staff issued the no action letter to FINRA outlining the two non custodial models for ATS's. And then he lays out sort of everything else there on explicitly exercising and talking about how the limited scope and duration of the special purpose broker dealer renders the license not well suited for market participants, et cetera, et cetera. So I really encourage people to go read that because I think you did a great job of it.
00:38:32.894 - 00:39:15.492, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's very clear that, like, from a pure substance and actual pragmatic and policy and intellectual standpoint, it doesn't make sense. But then you add on top of it, the strangeness of this, of Promethean specifically. Again, this is a company that was promoting private blockchains in 2020 that's partially owned by direct CCP connected investors in China, known ones, alleged, at least alleged by, you know, members of the House and Senate. I mean, respected ones, that doesn't. Can't speak to how crypto will be used. Like, there's just a bunch of weird. It's.
00:39:15.492 - 00:39:17.744, Speaker A: That's weird. That doesn't make any sense.
00:39:18.484 - 00:40:20.252, Speaker C: I think so. And I know you just ran the clip of representative flood, but just to underscore that, he explicitly laid out how Prometheum's claims that their special purpose broker dealer approval is evidence of a clear path for regulatory compliance is just untrue, and rather, that their inability to trade in widely traded assets like bitcoin and ethereum is explicitly why we need legislation. So the juxtaposition between those two sentences and sentiments and why Mister Kaplan was testifying in front of Congress is quite strange. What's even more strange is these witnesses don't come out of thin air. The committees invite them to come testify. And there are republican witnesses and there are democratic witnesses, and you can see that there was a clear intention to try to push a point. And I think that's probably something that not, isn't getting talked about a lot outside of Washington, but it does get a lot of airtime here.
00:40:20.388 - 00:40:48.664, Speaker A: Yeah, they're definitely, he was there for a reason. He pretty much appeared to be parroting chair Gensler's views on almost every issue. And then you saw a lot of the democratic representatives who were critical, who are critical, directed all the questions to him to have them agree with their position. Right. It was, and this is not unusual to your point. Right. These witnesses are invited for a reason.
00:40:48.664 - 00:40:54.164, Speaker A: They're invited by members. But this was clearly political statement being made.
00:40:54.584 - 00:41:34.264, Speaker C: Sure. I'm just suggesting that it gets back to our earlier conversation where we were talking about, do we see the true bipartisan support? And I think, yes, there is true bipartisan support that does exist. It's problematic in my mind, if you're asking a witness to come testify about an issue where the intention is to say, we don't need to do any of this, because it already exists in the capabilities. And if we know that to be patently untrue, wouldn't it be better if we just had witnesses there who were talking about, like, specific issues to help clarify points and make the bill better? Right.
00:41:34.424 - 00:41:59.964, Speaker A: Right. That's what I mean about him parroting chair Gensler. Because chair Gensler is quite famously said, they don't need additional legislation, that the existing rules and authorities for the SEC are sufficient. And that's the tack and strategy that the SEC is taking in its litigation, primarily with Coinbase as the example. Right. They're saying, dude, under the Exchange act, like, you have to register as an exchange. All these are unregistered.
00:41:59.964 - 00:42:18.180, Speaker A: All you've got to do is come in and fill out the form on the website. Right. No additional powers or legislation required. Right. Force fit it into the powers that already exist. And this guy, Mister Kaplan, was fully in support of that view, which. And then he's the.
00:42:18.180 - 00:42:26.244, Speaker A: They're the only one that's been approved by the SEC. It's just, it's something, it's a little fishy and confusing here.
00:42:26.284 - 00:42:28.020, Speaker C: So it just doesn't pass the smell test.
00:42:28.052 - 00:42:41.764, Speaker A: Right? No, it doesn't. Yeah. No, it doesn't. Okay, so let's, let's move on a little bit before I want to talk to you about presidential politics. Cause they're getting a little bit fun. But before we do that, let's chat a little bit more on the market structure bill you referenced a couple times. This is, you know, tell us what happened.
00:42:41.764 - 00:42:52.166, Speaker A: We know stable. There's two main initiatives here. Right. Coming out of Congress, stablecoin legislation and the market structure efforts. Right. And we mentioned stable coins a little bit. I don't think we need to go deep into that.
00:42:52.166 - 00:42:59.646, Speaker A: It's sort of on the back burner, it feels like right now, but market structure. Rhett McHenry and the chair of the Ag committee, whose name is escaping me.
00:42:59.790 - 00:43:00.894, Speaker C: GT Thompson.
00:43:01.014 - 00:43:15.910, Speaker A: Thompson. They put out a discussion draft. Right. So it's a 160 plus page bill to drive the discussion. It's quite comprehensive. Summarize it for us before. You don't have to get every point, but tell us what it has in it.
00:43:16.022 - 00:43:26.910, Speaker C: Yeah, well, let me just say at a top end, and McHenry said this in his opening statements, that he intends to move the bills out of the committee. I think he expressed. Let me just double check.
00:43:26.942 - 00:43:30.150, Speaker A: He expressed like mid July, basically. Yeah.
00:43:30.342 - 00:43:37.286, Speaker C: He wanted to, he wanted to move it out of the committee upon returning from the July 4 recess.
00:43:37.350 - 00:43:37.574, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:37.614 - 00:43:42.350, Speaker C: So I think, like, they're, they're moving full force ahead, and I think there's a lot of agreement between.
00:43:42.462 - 00:44:09.594, Speaker A: Your point otherwise, Representative McHenry is, he is a pretty influential and important member of the republican caucus. You mentioned why he helped Speaker McCarthy get elected as speaker. He worked on the debt ceiling. The fact that he and his staffs, and the staff of the committee, like, also came up with this absolute beast of a bill also. I mean, this guy is really working hard. Good.
00:44:09.674 - 00:44:11.466, Speaker C: I mean, this is years of work in the making.
00:44:11.530 - 00:44:11.826, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:11.890 - 00:44:14.654, Speaker C: We've been having this debate in the crypto space.
00:44:15.124 - 00:44:23.740, Speaker A: I mean, that you really have to be impressed by, to be clear, like, the comprehensive nature, and I think very thoughtful nature of the market structure bill is really impressive. Sure.
00:44:23.772 - 00:44:41.064, Speaker C: This is years of work. That is all I'm saying. There's at least eight years of substantive work that has gone into this creation of the bill. And sure, it's gotten refined, no question about it. The staffs on the financial services committee and the AG committees, they're doing a lot of work to pull this together. It's not easy to do.
00:44:41.844 - 00:44:44.744, Speaker A: So summarize it for us. What's in there, though?
00:44:45.484 - 00:45:33.700, Speaker C: I would recommend that people actually go look at it, and if they have thoughts and suggestions to the listeners, they should also send them in. And then I would really recommend reading coy Garrison's testimony because he did a good job summarizing things, too. But just on a quick hit list. The market structure bill creates responsibility and a clear regulatory framework for the digital assets phase. Right? So the discussion draft creates a new exemption from registration for the sale of digital assets pursuant to an investment contract. And it creates investor protection provisions, that is, aggregate offering, limit, individual investment limits for non accredited investors, etcetera. These provisions, like they're modeled after the securities laws and regulations.
00:45:33.700 - 00:46:35.348, Speaker C: So it includes Reg A, reg a plus, crowdfunding rule 144, all that good stuff. Then it creates a secondary trading pathway for these restricted digital assets on ATS alternative trading systems, and directs the SEC to modernize reg ATS. The bill also tackles the problem of when a digital asset is sold pursuant to a securities transaction and can become part of a digital asset. It's no longer a securities transaction because it's sufficiently decentralized. So it has that important characteristic that many people in the industry talk about. When does a particular asset become decentralized and when is a network fully sufficiently decentralized? Then the bill provides the CFTC with authority to regulate spot markets for digital commodities. That's a big deal that doesn't exist today.
00:46:35.348 - 00:47:21.782, Speaker C: And that was particularly what Mister Sexton was there to talk about. To talk about how digital commodity exchanges, dealers, brokers, qualified custodians, would have to register with the CFTC, how they would have to become members of the NFA, what authorities the NFA has, because they would be supervising these new entities. And then finally, the discussion draft is limited to the problem at hand, that we don't have federal spot market regulation for trading digital assets. That is the problem that we're trying to solve, creating that federal regulation for the spot market. So I would say those are like the five things that the bill sort of broadly tackles. It is long, it's very nuanced, and there's many other things there. But that's how I would summarize it.
00:47:21.878 - 00:47:56.018, Speaker A: No, great summary, Tyler. There was some interesting stuff. They did some real good work, for example, on decentralization. One of the things they said is that it cannot be a digital commodity. It would have to be a digital security if, and there's a whole list of things, right to your point. But one of them was if an organization, any organization, owned more than 20% of the supply. So they're actually doing some work on the specifics of what decentralization means, which I think is very smart, and who knows where those thresholds and whatnot all end up, right? But this is one of the core things.
00:47:56.018 - 00:48:35.010, Speaker A: Following head of corporate finance at the SEC Bill Hinman's famous 2018 speech where he said that Ethereum had become quote, sufficiently decentralized to no longer require registration as a security. Everyone was like, okay, like, what is sufficient decentralization? Literally, like, what is that? Like, can someone tell us? Right. And this bill, I think, admirably attempts to create some actual lines as to what might be sufficiently decentralized, literally numbers. Right. And we'll see where those end up. But that stuck out to me as one of the most interesting. Aside from, of course, I mean, the whole thing is so massive and overhauling of our system.
00:48:35.010 - 00:48:46.538, Speaker A: It's incredibly thoughtful. I really hope we see movement on this, and it's really encouraging that chair McHenry says they're going to move this thing in a month. Basically. It'll be moving. Yeah.
00:48:46.546 - 00:48:49.396, Speaker C: It's going to get out of the committee. No doubt about that.
00:48:49.460 - 00:48:57.556, Speaker A: Yeah. He's an influential member of the caucus, though. So, I mean, if he's now, as you know. Right. You say. You tell me all the time. I mean, the.
00:48:57.556 - 00:49:04.064, Speaker A: The calendar can overwhelm the House or in the Senate. Right. And the reality of the calendar can take hold. And.
00:49:04.764 - 00:49:28.066, Speaker C: Yeah, it's just a question of, can the bill get out of the house with a sufficient. And I think I've said this on the podcast before, getting the bill get out of the House with a suspension level vote, which requires two thirds of the members present to support the measure. If that can happen, then I would say the calculus changes for whether or not it can be advanced out of the Senate to the president. Yeah.
00:49:28.250 - 00:49:32.058, Speaker A: So you need, like, 3350 votes.
00:49:32.226 - 00:49:39.962, Speaker C: No, it's like, 200, 7280. It just depends on how many show up. 435 members. So it's two thirds of that. It's 280 something.
00:49:40.138 - 00:50:01.158, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. Hey, let's do some fun stuff. I know you're actually. You actually work on policy. You're not like a politics guy in the sense there is a distinction in the world of politics and policy. But let's talk a little bit of politics for fun here, because the race for president is starting to get a little bit more interesting.
00:50:01.158 - 00:50:21.282, Speaker A: And maybe, I don't know if you have a take on how any of this could affect crypto. We've got on the republican side, of course. Former President Trump has announced that he is running again. He was arraigned at a Miami federal court on Tuesday for these. Wait, which alleged crimes are these for? Oh, these are for the Mar a Lago documents.
00:50:21.338 - 00:50:24.786, Speaker C: Yeah, these are for the confidential documents that were at Mar a Lago.
00:50:24.890 - 00:50:52.562, Speaker A: Stacks of boxes. Now, the pictures, some pictures have been released. It appears to be a lot of documents based on some of the photos, literally stacks and stacks of banker boxes. But he is running. And his vice president, former vice president Mike Pence has announced that he's running. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has announced that he's running. And what do we call him? Technologist, biopharma guy.
00:50:52.562 - 00:50:56.570, Speaker A: Vivek Ramaswamy is running. Am I missing someone?
00:50:56.722 - 00:51:01.138, Speaker C: You're missing two people. You're missing Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina.
00:51:01.186 - 00:51:02.106, Speaker A: Tim Scott, yep.
00:51:02.170 - 00:51:08.722, Speaker C: Who is also the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, which, oh, by the way, has jurisdiction over all the things that we're talking about today.
00:51:08.818 - 00:51:09.490, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:51:09.562 - 00:51:12.076, Speaker C: And then you're also missing Governor DeSantis.
00:51:12.210 - 00:51:16.688, Speaker A: Oh, yes. And of course, Florida governor Ron DeSantis. So we've got a pretty interesting and.
00:51:16.736 - 00:51:19.200, Speaker C: Big feeling that's just on the republican side, correct?
00:51:19.232 - 00:51:55.976, Speaker A: That's just on the republican side. We'll talk about the democratic thing in a second. But let's talk about these, these, this slate that we have out here now, Vivek Ramaswamy, he spoke at bitcoin 2023, and his, he is loudly pro bitcoin. So that's great. But he's probably the longest shot candidate in this field. Anyone else in there stand out to you on the crypto side as being interesting? I guess. Governor DeSantis says his crypto, he seems maybe supportive, but he's put forth a bill, or they put forth some bill in Florida banning cbdcs.
00:51:55.976 - 00:52:01.192, Speaker A: So he's clearly aware of crypto policy. But anything with him or anyone else stand out to you?
00:52:01.248 - 00:52:34.236, Speaker C: Well, I mean, Trump had an NFT man, right? So that happened. I mean, I don't think I would look at the field and say there's an explicitly pro crypto candidate in there. I would say there are many candidates that are probably more intellectually open to embracing the industry or at least letting it flourish in the US. And there are certainly, I think it's true for all of the candidates that they are supportive of technology being developed in the US as opposed to outsourcing that.
00:52:34.340 - 00:52:51.524, Speaker A: Right. So, like, so Vivek, I will say, is explicitly pro crypto. But like I said, he's the longest shot candidate to me. I don't know, it's just, if you had to just back of the napkin here, Tyler, gun to your head, you think President Trump wins the nomination?
00:52:51.824 - 00:52:53.968, Speaker C: I think it's certain point in time.
00:52:54.056 - 00:52:58.784, Speaker A: And the polls say right now definitely yes. I mean, he's leading by a lot right now.
00:52:58.824 - 00:53:18.328, Speaker C: Yeah, it's his to lose for sure. And I think all of these indictments in some weird way help him, because if you look at the field, like he would rather, I think he would rather it be the case that it's a stacked field, because he knows he has some type of just ingrained base that's always going to support him, whereas.
00:53:18.376 - 00:53:21.008, Speaker A: Theirs is diluted basically exactly where we.
00:53:21.016 - 00:53:33.840, Speaker C: Can get through the primaries, particularly the early ones, with 20% to 25% of the primary voters supporting them. Does he really need anything else? Yeah, not necessarily.
00:53:33.952 - 00:54:24.526, Speaker A: He did say, I am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because he believes they threatened the dollar. That was one of his only statements ever on crypto as president. And he did have Secretary Mnuchin, who I wouldn't say was terrible, but did advance that sort of midnight rulemaking at FinCEN that would have been detrimental to self custody, which the industry widely pushed back on and was forced to be tabled, or was tabled by the Biden administration when they came in and halted all rulemaking. And I guess it's still technically there at FinCEN, but inactive or something. So he hasn't been good. President Trump was not good for crypto, quote, unquote, but he wasn't, certainly was not as engaged or antagonistic as the current democratic administration.
00:54:24.710 - 00:54:56.046, Speaker C: Right. I mean, I don't think this is top of the issue list for President Biden either. I think you could say that Biden was somewhat supportive of the space by virtue of issuing the executive order. However, if you look at the sum total of the things that have happened after that, I don't think you could say that President Biden or his team are particularly helpful to anything. If anything, the independent regulators have been given such a long leash that they've run roughshod.
00:54:56.230 - 00:55:09.270, Speaker A: I agree. But also, we have seen from the White House some negative stuff. Right. You had Brian Deese's blog, like, essentially mitigating the risks of crypto assets or whatever, right? That's right there on the White House's website.
00:55:09.342 - 00:55:30.442, Speaker C: Absolutely. I think you have to remember that was, like, within the context of the banking issue. It was, and I'm not defending it, and I think abnormal for the White House to play put out a statement like that when the prudential banking regulators were the ones responsible for this, and the after effects and reports suggest that it had nothing to do with crypto itself.
00:55:30.578 - 00:55:43.626, Speaker A: And you have the academics that, like the CEA, like, putting out negative stuff. There was this thing. Let me ask you something, Tyler. There was the, I think it was the council for economic advisors. They were the ones that suggested that 30% after, like, a vast dating tax.
00:55:43.690 - 00:55:44.226, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:44.370 - 00:55:54.650, Speaker A: Yeah. On digital asset mining, it wasn't the White House. Right. It was one of those policy advisory councils that suggested that tax. Right.
00:55:54.682 - 00:56:24.488, Speaker C: It's not explicitly an advisory council. It does live within the White House. And I think it was President Truman who set up the CEA, and it was supposed to, like, produce an annual report on the state of the economy to the president. It still does that. They are quasi independent. When you look at them, versus the White House's domestic policy council or the NEC, the National Economic Council, those explicitly live within, like, the White House. And the CEA does, too.
00:56:24.488 - 00:56:26.096, Speaker C: It's just slightly different.
00:56:26.200 - 00:57:05.632, Speaker A: But they were the ones that floated the concept of that tax. Right. It wasn't the right. Yeah, but then, so, and then during the debt ceiling debate, there were some, I think Senator Loomis and maybe some others said, hey, we kept that tax out of the debt ceiling deal. And you recall that President Biden had explicitly said that was a statement that republicans wanted to protect wealthy crypto bros. Instead of helping people buy food or something, was the critical statement. I think that was probably in reference more to the crypto wash sale rule stuff.
00:57:05.632 - 00:57:24.600, Speaker A: But some people took a victory lap and said they helped keep that 30% tax out. Was that, was that tax ever in, was that actually ever introduced or floated? It seemed kind of not to me that this victory lap, some of our allies, some of Crypto's allies were taking and bitcoin's allies that, like, did that. Was that ever viable to be in there?
00:57:24.752 - 00:57:41.756, Speaker C: I don't think it was ever, like, particularly viable. I think that, you know, there's lots of people in Washington who want to claim credit. What's the, quote, success has many parents. Right. And I don't think it's true that it was, like, in earnest in debate.
00:57:41.860 - 00:57:56.492, Speaker A: Yeah, but, hey, if that was brought up in conversations and you, our representatives, helped keep it out. Thank you. But I remember that didn't seem, I didn't think it was actually viable. Okay. This is just, I mean, now we're really straying here. But the democratic side now for president. Right.
00:57:56.492 - 00:58:16.402, Speaker A: You have, you have Marion Williamson, who ran previously, and you have Robert F. Kennedy Junior, I think are the ones I've heard that I've announced. But the president and the current president. Well, and then President Biden. Sorry. Yes, but the president is the head of the party by definition. Right.
00:58:16.402 - 00:58:35.966, Speaker A: And primaries don't exist. They're not real. They're not constitutional. Right. Anyone can essentially whatever the rules are. But get on a ballot for, like, the general election is the actual election. Primaries are merely, like, which group decides to have a runoff to say, like, our person's gonna be there.
00:58:35.966 - 00:58:41.438, Speaker A: Right. So what I'm getting at here is the Democrats are not likely to have a primary, are they?
00:58:41.566 - 00:58:51.150, Speaker C: It seems unlikely. All the chatter that I have heard is that the primary sort of debate process is going to be sort of non existent.
00:58:51.262 - 00:59:07.022, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, why? If you're the party and you're happy, the party leadership, the party apparatus, the party is happy with their incumbent president who is running for reelection, you only harm that president's prospects by opening up a primary process. Right.
00:59:07.198 - 00:59:22.726, Speaker C: It would be the exact same thing that we saw. I don't remember what year the election was where Ross Perot ran in as an independent. Is that right, George? Hw Bush was running. I guess it was against Clinton. It must have been 92, right?
00:59:22.790 - 00:59:24.606, Speaker A: Must have been 92, yeah, 92.
00:59:24.670 - 00:59:25.606, Speaker C: So it was 92.
00:59:25.670 - 00:59:33.110, Speaker A: 96 was the other guy who ran, that nice old Republican. He did the PEPC commercial. What was that guy's name?
00:59:33.262 - 00:59:34.806, Speaker C: Oh, you're talking Bob Dole. It was.
00:59:34.950 - 00:59:40.398, Speaker A: Bob Dole was 96, yeah. And 92 was Ross Perot. He had to run as an independent.
00:59:40.446 - 00:59:43.054, Speaker C: Right, right. But I think he got almost 18%.
00:59:43.094 - 00:59:45.714, Speaker A: Of the vote, which pretty well really.
00:59:45.754 - 01:00:04.138, Speaker C: Took away the base of support that in absence of him running, would have likely gone to HW Bush. So maybe we could see something like that happen on the democratic side. I just don't know. Yeah, so, as you know, I worked in, like, republican policy politics circles. I'm less attuned to this than I.
01:00:04.146 - 01:00:31.006, Speaker A: Am totally and totally get that. But I mention it, it's particularly interesting to me because Robert F. Kennedy Junior is a vocal advocate for bitcoin. He gave a rousing speech at bitcoin 2023. And so, yeah, I mean, to me, he seems the most likely to maybe run as an independent. This is a lifelong Democrat, of course. This is the son of former attorney general Robert F.
01:00:31.006 - 01:00:45.176, Speaker A: Kennedy and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. Anyway, he's a very interesting candidate just from in general. Like, he is a wide. A range of very interesting positions. So I think are interesting. So worth checking out.
01:00:45.176 - 01:00:50.608, Speaker A: But, yeah, unlikely he's going to get his day on the ballot unless he runs as an independent, is what it looks like, perhaps.
01:00:50.656 - 01:01:26.734, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a lot of time that can happen. There's so much time between now and when you really need to get in in earnest. Like, when. When did Trump get into the race? In was it September of 15 when he came down? Came down the escalator? Yeah, came down the escalator. And so if you think about the cycle, there's just so much else that can happen now. I will say, like, I personally think that the presidential politics and who the party nominees are, are more impactful in the Senate races, and that's what I'll be paying attention to in terms of that.
01:01:27.234 - 01:01:30.082, Speaker A: So you mean like how the top of the ballot will affect. Yeah.
01:01:30.098 - 01:01:57.178, Speaker C: But who the president is obviously has a significant impact on who's leading our regulators. And it matters for who our appointees are at the, in the cabinet, who the secretary of the treasury becomes, but also matters who's the chair of the CFTC, the SEC, who's running the OCC, who's running the FDIC, etcetera. It just matters in so many other areas that, like, people should pay attention to it for that reason, too.
01:01:57.266 - 01:02:14.588, Speaker A: Totally. But your point was that the top of the ballot, quote unquote, like that, that really, if you have a lot of energy behind a presidential candidate, that's why a lot of voters go out to vote. And that can really impact the down ballot races like for the Senate or the House, right, where they get 100%.
01:02:14.716 - 01:02:18.708, Speaker C: And I think in particular have more of an effect this time in the Senate.
01:02:18.876 - 01:02:36.846, Speaker A: Interesting look, man, this is a great conversation. Tyler, thanks for checking in from Washington and tdog. T will, you're like the t will of t bills.
