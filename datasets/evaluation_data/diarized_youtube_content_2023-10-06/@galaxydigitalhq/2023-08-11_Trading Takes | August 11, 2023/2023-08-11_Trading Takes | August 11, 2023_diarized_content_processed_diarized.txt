00:00:07.640 - 00:00:11.326, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, great to be.
00:00:11.350 - 00:00:12.366, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.510 - 00:00:30.734, Speaker A: So we've had a little bit of a recovery. You can see over my shoulder here on the block clock from, I guess, a little bit in doldrums, but again, still in the channel. Bitcoin volatility has been almost at historic lows, it seems like. I mean, I haven't seen a lot of data what's going on in the markets these days.
00:00:31.834 - 00:00:39.922, Speaker B: I think in crypto, it's just been sort of like a malaise just as a function of an absence of catalysts.
00:00:40.018 - 00:00:40.418, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:40.506 - 00:00:44.414, Speaker B: We had the ripple stuff a couple weeks ago. Those court cases.
00:00:46.474 - 00:00:49.466, Speaker A: ETF stuff was now at this point, like almost two months ago.
00:00:49.570 - 00:01:23.350, Speaker B: Correct. And so it just kind of feels like a waiting game in crypto. And then risk markets more broadly haven't fared too poorly or too great, to be honest with you. S and P is down almost a percent today, and we've had a couple large tech names that have really underperformed, but it doesn't seem like we're on the precipice of a big sell off or anything like that. The real story that at least attracted my interest a lot is on the, on the fixed income side.
00:01:23.382 - 00:01:27.806, Speaker A: That's what you said last week. You gave us some of the stuff about the long end of.
00:01:27.990 - 00:01:38.630, Speaker B: So the long end of the curve. You know, we've sustained above 4% on the 30 year for a little bit now. I think 30 year yields are hovering around, like, 418 right now.
00:01:38.662 - 00:01:43.086, Speaker A: So can you break down just for our audience, what that really tells you?
00:01:43.110 - 00:01:43.246, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:43.270 - 00:01:47.094, Speaker A: I mean, we're talking about long dated issuance, right? So long term bond, 30 year bonds.
00:01:47.174 - 00:01:48.030, Speaker B: 30 year bonds, right?
00:01:48.062 - 00:02:06.006, Speaker A: Like, that's, that's buying us debt that doesn't mature for 30 years. Right. So theoretically, if you're very bullish on, like, long term us debt, having debt, paying its debt, being a good economy in 30 years, et cetera. Right. You, you could hold that for a long time. You would feel that. Well, but, so people, when the, when the rates go up, it means there's less demand for it.
00:02:06.006 - 00:02:16.144, Speaker A: What, what exactly is, what is this telling you? Is there any, is it a combination of a comment on, you know, the United States is 30 year prospects? I mean.
00:02:16.254 - 00:02:19.772, Speaker B: Well, I would just treat it as a market like anything else.
00:02:19.868 - 00:02:20.148, Speaker C: Right?
00:02:20.196 - 00:02:39.772, Speaker B: It's just another asset. And so, you know, what moves an asset? It's like buyers and sellers. And I tell you, that there's an absence of buyers right now and it's pretty meaningful. And there's an absence of buyers. One because central banks are pulling back and actually tightening their balance sheets rather than expanding them.
00:02:39.828 - 00:02:41.524, Speaker A: So they're buying less of it.
00:02:41.684 - 00:03:30.820, Speaker B: Yes, correct. And they're big buyers. And I think foreign appetite has waned a little bit as well just because foreign central banks are doing the same thing. In addition, just functionally, the front end has gotten more attractive on a relative basis because we've jacked up frontend rates are high, you don't have to take duration risk there. And then I think another element of it is also just uncertainty around inflation going out 30 years. There's a high degree of variability to fixed income and inflation expectations and where inflation realizes over that time. And so you require a higher term premium in theory.
00:03:30.820 - 00:04:18.938, Speaker B: And so I think the market is just repricing that part of the curve in the context of inflation, which could really start going back up again. The big story this week is you've got CPI on Thursday. Headline CPI is expected to come in in the low threes and core CPI is expected to come in mid to high fours. But when you look at things like energy markets, crude just topped dollar 84 a barrel. Nat gas has started to pop off, you know, in Europe as one example. And so there are clearly upside risks to inflation still, particularly in the context of a labor market that's just so tight at three and a half percent unemployment.
00:04:19.066 - 00:04:54.124, Speaker A: I was showing this, I said this to somebody and I was explaining what I think is a pretty wide consensus that you've articulated plenty, which is that unemployment is good. CPI has come down, of course, can go back up, but like, you know, the idea that the soft landing is possible, right. And even probably the more likely of the scenario when you look at everything right now, and they were like, yeah, but like, you can't use unemployment. Cause like if you look at actual numbers of people searching for jobs, it's worse. And I'm like, so I did that. It's not worse. Yes, the labor force participation rate on balance is lower than it has been long term.
00:04:54.124 - 00:04:58.724, Speaker A: But if you take out those, the elderly, yeah. If you look at 25 to 54, it's near all time highs.
00:04:58.764 - 00:04:58.916, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:58.940 - 00:04:59.588, Speaker B: That participation.
00:04:59.636 - 00:05:00.452, Speaker A: So people are working.
00:05:00.508 - 00:05:05.900, Speaker B: I mean, people are working and the problem is they're actually, the wages are keeping up or that, you know, there's.
00:05:05.932 - 00:05:09.636, Speaker A: Wage, so they're working and they're making more money. Correct. Wages are going up too.
00:05:09.700 - 00:05:10.084, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:10.164 - 00:05:12.508, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just, it is interesting.
00:05:12.636 - 00:05:17.460, Speaker B: Yeah. Unless you have that come off and in some way, like, it's going to be tough to tackle inflation.
00:05:17.532 - 00:05:17.812, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:17.868 - 00:05:25.676, Speaker B: And my other point to that is like, you know, stocks have come off a little bit, but who's really going to lay off like 10% of their workforce if their stock price is like.
00:05:25.700 - 00:05:27.948, Speaker A: Close down a couple percent or like.
00:05:28.036 - 00:05:29.388, Speaker B: Super close to all time highs, right.
00:05:29.396 - 00:05:43.324, Speaker A: I mean, yeah. Like, even though, you know, we were talking about the, there were some big tech names and equities, like last Friday was a pretty big sell off. Right? Yeah, but you know, like, you know, it sell off from like all time high. Yeah, a couple percent from all time high.
00:05:43.404 - 00:05:43.668, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:43.716 - 00:05:46.956, Speaker A: And so you need more sustained reductions there, too.
00:05:47.020 - 00:05:47.436, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:47.540 - 00:06:10.392, Speaker A: And the fear is that if you ever looked at the interest rate chart or the inflation from like the seventies and eighties when Paul Volcker was at the Fed, like, yeah, they raised them and it came down a little bit and then they thought they were done and then it like, spiked back. They did, they went, there were multiple attempts at curbing inflation back then. And that's obviously what the Fed is very weary of and doesn't want to have to do. That's why they're remaining hawkish. Right, correct.
00:06:10.448 - 00:06:30.032, Speaker B: Higher for longer is how they're putting it. And functionally, there are things that mean that the inflation number is going to continue to have upside risks because you're losing really low numbers from a year ago now. So you're getting the opposite of base effect. Yeah, some base effects.
00:06:30.048 - 00:06:30.644, Speaker C: Basically.
00:06:32.744 - 00:06:46.304, Speaker B: It makes things very tricky. But I think ultimately, like, what the feds, you know, left in terms of decisions is, you know, they basically have to stay higher for longer. And the question is, like, how high?
00:06:46.424 - 00:06:47.056, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:06:47.080 - 00:06:52.160, Speaker B: And so do they hike rates one more time or do they pause like they do? Right? Or maybe I think they should.
00:06:52.272 - 00:06:54.704, Speaker A: They could just, maybe they pause again.
00:06:54.824 - 00:06:57.924, Speaker B: I mean, the way I think about it is like, what are you really risking?
00:06:58.504 - 00:07:00.160, Speaker A: You can always swoop in and cut like.
00:07:00.232 - 00:07:23.692, Speaker B: Yeah, like, why wouldn't you if you're genuinely still worried? And I personally, I'm like, some of these valuations and equities are just still absurd. They still seem high, still absurd. And like, some of the valuations in like, privates still, still crazy. Nobody's really selling their homes. Like, home prices have been fine. Where you're seeing weaknesses in things like, you know, used autos, which, okay, it's.
00:07:23.708 - 00:07:26.068, Speaker A: Not, it's not like the core of the economy. It matters.
00:07:26.156 - 00:07:31.144, Speaker B: It matters. But it's not, you know, it's not the end all. It's like, cars get cheaper.
00:07:32.204 - 00:07:33.028, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:07:33.156 - 00:08:23.560, Speaker B: And so I think it's a really weird spot. And the way I think about things is like, really? Okay, so let's say we're in this kind of economy for the next couple of years. Are terminal rates properly priced? And so the way I think about terminal rates is like, the end state of what neutral is for the fed funds rate. And right now, market based expectations have that around 3.3%. So that's a 200 basis point cut from, like, peak terminal rates. And so, you know, I still struggle with that idea because the US economy looks like it is functioning just fine with 5% interest rates. And, like, I know we've got these student loan things coming, et cetera, but I think there's a very feasible scenario where it's like, 5% interest rates are just normal.
00:08:23.560 - 00:08:25.624, Speaker B: They don't cause anything to, like, blow.
00:08:25.664 - 00:08:43.528, Speaker A: Up at all, which makes sense. You hear, you know, it's like you had to walk uphill both ways to school when I was a kid, but I hear the same, like, oh, we had to pay like 1213 percent depending on when your parents or grant or whoever's saying this hypothetical thing to you. They've been high. They've been high in the past, and the economy has functioned. Yeah, we just became very used to.
00:08:43.536 - 00:08:59.438, Speaker B: Very high, I think, particularly in the US, where folks are just so sheltered from high interest rates with respect to, you know, having locked in a lot of fixed rate financing, the US in particular can, can really handle higher for longer. Super well.
00:08:59.526 - 00:09:10.326, Speaker A: Yep. All right, well, we're going to have to see what happens. It is a little bit of the doldrums of summer, August for sure, but I know it's going to be an exciting fall, too. But in crypto and in markets.
00:09:10.390 - 00:09:13.074, Speaker B: Just give me an ETF. I'm not asking for much.
00:09:13.854 - 00:09:17.434, Speaker A: Our friend Bim Netabee from Galaxy trading, as always, thanks. Thanks for joining galaxy brains. Bye.
