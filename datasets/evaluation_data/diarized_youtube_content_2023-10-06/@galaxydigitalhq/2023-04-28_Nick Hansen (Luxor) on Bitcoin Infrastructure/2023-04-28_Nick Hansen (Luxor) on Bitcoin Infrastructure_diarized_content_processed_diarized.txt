00:00:06.880 - 00:00:47.854, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. It's another app and I've come to run the deck, double down and plumb the depths? Run the town, pump the sound till I'm out of breath? Climbing up the stairs till I'm out of steps? Cause we on top let the bass kick like a bomb drop? Counting up the odd lots bouncing when the pod drops see me when I talk shop on bitcoin infrastructure. Nick Hanson is our guest. He's the CEO of luxurious and boom. And buster. If we're staying steady, lads, I've been here for years and I'm never going back. Eleven on the track, see me levitate with rap? We're in the upside down with the regulated tac but we play hard, go on target in our sights, come out the dark, close, strong and eat up the light, yo.
00:00:47.854 - 00:01:09.606, Speaker A: It's too important for us to not fight the good fight. Do not go quietly into that good night. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, CEO of Luxor, Nick Hanson, is our guest. Luxor is a bitcoin infrastructure company with a mining pool and data, and they do work on ordinals.
00:01:09.606 - 00:01:34.090, Speaker A: Now, it's a great conversation, and of course, we'll also check in with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, to talk markets and macro. But before we get into all of that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.

00:01:34.090 - 00:01:38.730, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:01:38.802 - 00:01:40.774, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. How you doing?
00:01:41.714 - 00:01:52.610, Speaker A: I'm good. I'm in Texas. I'm in Austin, Texas. You are not in the office either, so this is one of our rare remote meetings. But it's good to see you. I like those glasses.
00:01:52.682 - 00:01:53.138, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:01:53.186 - 00:01:58.890, Speaker B: Thank you so much. A little under the weather right now. I'm sure you guys can hear, so.
00:01:59.042 - 00:02:15.354, Speaker A: But we never miss a quick update with Bimnat. And just for our listeners, some of the rest of this episode was previously recorded. You'll see me in the studio with our guest Nick Hanson after this segment. But bim, let's get into it. It's, um, you know, we're recording. It's Wednesday, April 26. A couple things to bring up.
00:02:15.354 - 00:02:32.190, Speaker A: The, the one that struck me the most was waking up this morning and seeing bitcoin basically regaining 30k. You know, it's trading slightly below 29, eight, no block clock behind me to show it right now, but it's a significant move up from where we were in the low 27s. What's going on and markets today?
00:02:32.342 - 00:03:35.624, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of market volatility has recently been driven by concerns surrounding a regional bank, one in particular, First Republic. They had reported quarterly earnings earlier this week, and it showed that they had lost about $100 billion in deposits at their peak. I believe they were a $200 billion deposit institution and I think roughly a $40 billion market cap institution. And now since the earnings, you know, we've seen their stock pretty much collapse to roughly a 1 billion market cap. And that's all around the idea that there is really no bailout coming or headlines about whether or not there is a bailout coming or there isn't. There was a headline out earlier this morning saying that the government doesn't want to intervene in this situation. And so it's basically going to be up to the market to kind of figure out what they're going to do with this institution.
00:03:35.624 - 00:03:53.144, Speaker B: And as a reminder to folks, this is an institution that basically has made a ton of long, has a lot of long duration assets on its balance sheet and a lot of short dated liabilities. And so just a fundamental balance sheet mismanagement situation.
00:03:53.604 - 00:04:14.044, Speaker A: Yeah. This is one of those banks that was teetering ever since Silicon Valley bank. Right. I mean, sort of been, they had the injection from the G sibs, they, the big banks, just what agreed. I'm sure there was some cajoling, but they agreed to deposit $30 billion there to shore up the balance sheet. But it seems like it's been sort of a dead man walking at this point.
00:04:14.544 - 00:05:29.570, Speaker B: Exactly. And so now the market is trying to look ahead as to what a potential solution looks like for this bank and what are the kind of implications, more broadly for the rest of the regional banks. And the main thing that sticks out in my head is there's an implicit guarantee right now for the main GSIB banks. They are definitely too big to fill. And if you go back to what Secretary Yellen and other folks were saying right around the time of Silicon Valley and signature depositors are generally safe. The question is like, how should somebody with large pools of money be thinking about where to park their assets? Are regional banks safe, or is there a guarantee above the 250k number that the FDIC has provided, et cetera? And so more and more, the conclusion that we've come to here is that you're setting up a situation where essentially all depositors are guaranteed and you're going to essentially move to a marketplace for deposits that that's incredibly competitive. And you're going to have a situation where credit is going to meaningfully tighten.
00:05:29.570 - 00:06:52.256, Speaker B: Because one just think about First Republic bank. They are going to have to offload $100 billion worth of long duration assets into the marketplace. Some bank or some institution has to buy those assets. When you have assets that are going to maybe trade at a discount, etcetera, what's your real incentive to go extend credit when there's all these distressed sales of banks and bank assets, etcetera? And you know you're just going to be losing reserves over time as TGA balances pick up, as QT sort of moves forward 100 billion per month, et cetera, you're going to be losing deposits over time as well. There's really a very dynamic set of circumstances that are at play here with the banking system. And the market yesterday got very worried about sort of a left tail scenario where you have banking stresses combined with souring economic data combined with a Fed that is most likely going to hike on May 3 and basically a week from now. What you had happened was a huge rally in front end duration, and you actually saw may meeting pricing move down a lot, but you had certain parts of the US front end curve moving by 30 basis points.
00:06:52.256 - 00:07:53.502, Speaker B: You had gold breaking through two k as folks got concerned. And so there's a flight to quality. And that helped bitcoin a little bit because it was able to recapture the story that had driven so much of the performance this year, which is a failing banking system. The move from twenty k to twenty eight k bitcoin was largely off the back of Silicon Valley Bank's failure and the sort of apparentness of the need for bitcoin in moments like those. And so you had a little bit of that narrative come back into the market when you were in technically oversold conditions. I would say there was a large binance twap seller last week that had kind of artificially depressed prices. You were at support around 27k in bitcoin, and the move higher happened in a low liquidity window, which is sort of us afternoon session.
00:07:53.502 - 00:08:30.404, Speaker B: And so you had liquidations, a little bit of a short gamma squeeze. You had actual buyers come in because of a change in the narrative. And all of a sudden, bitcoin goes from 27,300 to 30,000 in the span of 12 hours. And so it's a pretty dramatic move. I didn't anticipate a move of this magnitude. I did think that another bank potentially failing, or rumors around another potential failure was going to help bitcoin. But the magnitude of this move has definitely caught me a little bit off guard.
00:08:30.404 - 00:08:31.740, Speaker B: It's just so quick.
00:08:31.812 - 00:09:08.842, Speaker A: Yeah, I was taken aback a little bit, too, when, like I said, I woke up this morning, too, and it really had started to pump all the way to 30k. But look, I guess the corn is going to do what it's going to do. The only other thing I'd mention is pretty impressive. To see bitcoin still leading this rally, which is what it did, particularly post Shanghai, kind of felt like March was the banking narrative, and then April came Shanghai for ETH, and you'd think ETH would then be in the driver's seat. But I guess maybe, like you're saying, the banking narrative here is playing a factor still. People are still. Argentina central bank appeared to have plundered retail bank accounts in order to get to dollars.
00:09:08.842 - 00:09:18.970, Speaker A: I feel like that was almost a little bit of a Cyprus moment, a bail in moment that also felt like a bitcoin kind of buoyant narrative. But things are looking pretty strong.
00:09:19.082 - 00:09:57.060, Speaker B: No, absolutely. I mean, the stories and the cases for bitcoin are all around us. And I think folks in the west, it's become more apparent recently because you had historically stable institutions failing. So it became more apparent for somebody in Em. Like, bitcoin is a story that plays every day. Hyperinflation is an issue that is present every day. Capital controls and people's dollar bank accounts not having access to them, or awful exchange rates, that's a story that plays every day in em.
00:09:57.060 - 00:10:42.976, Speaker B: And so I think getting the focus of the US is super important to driving it, but it's not necessary. And a lot of what you saw earlier this year was a bitcoin rally that was driven by largely non us folks, if you just looked at the performance of bitcoin in certain regions. And so I try to take a step back and try to think critically about what are the global forces shaping bitcoin. And there are just so many each and every day. So that's why I'm still constructive on it. Technically speaking, it is respecting trends like unbelievably well. Like bitcoin had 110 percent drawdown and it got bought, and now you're back at.
00:10:42.976 - 00:11:24.802, Speaker B: It's been setting higher highs and higher lows. It's an asset that is clearly trending. The dollar de dollarization story is not going away anytime soon. I mean, there are headlines literally every day about BRICS and new nations trying to join Russia, China, trade developments, gold gaining more prominence. There are these constructive developments literally every day. I think that's why you're seeing this asset trend really well. The last thing I'll leave you guys with, I think the story of adoption, really, in terms of when it kicks into the next gears, is once you get major institutional adoption again, or at least once you start to see more money flowing in.
00:11:24.802 - 00:12:09.290, Speaker B: Today, the CME CEO was on CNBC talking about bitcoin, CME volumes and ETH volumes, et cetera. And the one thing he noted and wanted to stress about his crypto products was that the large versions of his crypto products are the ones that are doing the best in terms of the ones that are picking up most traction. He's saying there's a bifurcation between retail and institutional, and he's seeing institutional grow more and more. And when he went out to London recently, he said the amount of activity and the buzz around it was super compelling. And he sees it as a product he's going to perpetually, essentially be offering. And so I think there's just all sorts of constructive stories at play. And, yeah, it's an asset that's trending higher.
00:12:09.362 - 00:12:19.194, Speaker A: Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, thank you so much. Let's go now to our guest, Nick Hansen, CEO, founder of Luxor Technology Corporation. Luxor. Nick, great to have you here.
00:12:19.274 - 00:12:29.370, Speaker C: Yeah, awesome to be here. First time checking out the new office. Very, very nice. The recording studio is incredibly high quality, so this is probably going to be the best my voice has ever sound on a podcast.
00:12:29.442 - 00:12:44.214, Speaker A: Yeah, it will. We have great production. Shout out to Phineas and Badir for this help. Really happy to have you, Nick. So, Lux, I guess I'll say it, but then you correct me. Luxor. Among the many things you do, you run a bitcoin mining pool.
00:12:44.554 - 00:13:07.530, Speaker C: Yeah. So if you Google Luxor, the thing that you'll find is luxur mining pool. Like, that's the thing we're known for, specifically bitcoin mining. We're the second largest north american pool first. North american pool second to foundry, of course. But we do a lot of other things. We have financial products for miners, so we produce something called deluxe or hash price NDF, which is a cash settled NDF.
00:13:07.530 - 00:13:40.764, Speaker C: And then we have other derivatives products as well, mostly for miners like hedge or for other folks to get leverage financing products, that sort of thing. We also produce a firmware, which is the software that goes on a device. You can almost think of that as like when we used to jailbreak our iPhone. Like, the iPhone is a phenomenal platform, but there's still a few features that are locked. We build a firmware that allows you to do that on the mining machine. And then we also do a bunch of machine brokerage through a platform we call Luxor RFQ. So the ability to go post your buys and sells, it's kind of like eBay for mining machines.
00:13:40.764 - 00:14:18.516, Speaker C: But the reason you can't use eBay or Amazon or anything like that is like it's just such a bespoke process, requires a ton of logistics, a lot of hand holding, that sort of thing. So those are the things that we're known for. And then, of course, most recently, we acquired ordinal hub with the craze and ordinals I never got. I was self proclaimed. I missed the NFT boat the very first time around, and mostly because it was on chains that I wasn't really interested in. I'm a bitcoin maxi at heart. Maybe not the toxic maxi culture that exists today, but I'm definitely a financial bitcoin maximalist and really believe that pretty much anything that needs to be done of value should be done on bitcoin.
00:14:18.516 - 00:14:35.108, Speaker C: And now that we have that on bitcoin with ordinals and inscriptions, I was like, we went all in on that and decided we went out and bought ordinal hub, which came with Jameson Nunny as the head of ordinals for Luxor. And now we're pushing that envelope in many different facets. So those are the big things. That's fascinating.
00:14:35.156 - 00:15:01.650, Speaker A: So plenty of topics we can talk about. Let's, let's go right to ordinals for now, and then we'll get into some bitcoin mining and bitcoin related stuff. But so, one thing that I know you're well known for in ordinal world and in bitcoin, uh, you guys were the ones that helped those folks rip the four mega, as they say, the four megabyte block, Luxor mined or mining pool, what do we say? Delivered, um, the largest block in bitcoin history.
00:15:01.802 - 00:15:02.274, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:02.354 - 00:15:06.874, Speaker A: What was that about? And it was the picture of taproot wizards, like, come join us.
00:15:06.914 - 00:15:07.178, Speaker C: Yep.
00:15:07.226 - 00:15:08.082, Speaker A: Magic Internet money.
00:15:08.138 - 00:15:32.294, Speaker C: Yep. It was the, uh. So the reason. So the reason ordinals in mining really, uh, are very cohesive is because ordinals drive fee volume. Fee volume drives minor profits. So all of the customers that use Luxor are benefiting from the work that is being done to promote more ordinals and inscriptions. Because mempool is fuller, there's more transaction fee volume, which increases revenues.
00:15:32.294 - 00:15:58.362, Speaker C: When Udi and Eric and the rest of the taproot wizards council approached us to rip a four megger. That's what they say. Yeah, rip a four megger. The reason you need a mining pool for that is because the bitcoin core node, if anybody, probably your guests, are running a. Your listeners, are running a bitcoin node at home. If somebody tries to relay a transaction that's more than 400 kb, your node will reject it. It's called the.
00:15:58.362 - 00:16:18.454, Speaker C: It's called the mempool policy. There's a bunch of different policies. Like, there's a certain fee threshold. They won't accept transaction with zero fee and all sorts of different things. So we decided to build a bitcoin core node that got rid of all those policies. One of the. Of course, the taproot wizard was infamously a zero fee transaction as well.
00:16:18.454 - 00:16:33.406, Speaker C: But more importantly, we removed the 400 kilobyte limit and allowed it to be up to the four megar size so we could then inject it into the mempool that was mining all of our. That was mining our transactions. Your own mempool, basically, our own mempool pools.
00:16:33.430 - 00:16:34.110, Speaker A: Mempool, yeah.
00:16:34.182 - 00:17:25.156, Speaker C: And then, of course, it wouldn't broadcast to anyone else because they wouldn't accept such a large transaction. So, sitting in our mempool, our miners were receiving those transactions via the bitcoin jobs that they were working on. And then ultimately, somebody submitted the winning solution, and then it got broadcast. And that was one of the big inflection points in the initial run of ordinals was this idea of a four mega. And then we have had a backlog of folks trying to get their own four megger, really? Which has been really interesting, because it does. I don't want to say it's not mev on bitcoin the same way that there's mev on ETH or other chains, because there's not on chain mechanics like that. It is some extra value that we're able to extract via just being well connected and going out and putting in legwork for.
00:17:25.260 - 00:17:53.188, Speaker A: Yeah, it is kind of mev in a way, which is highly on ETH, highly dependent on transaction ordering. Right. Because transactions on Ethereum execute chronologically in the EVM. So where your transaction is inside a block is very important. And that's how sandwich attacks and front running and back running can be done on bitcoin. Transactions execute atomically. So there is no, if it's in a block, they all happen at once.
00:17:53.188 - 00:18:04.156, Speaker A: There's no, like, order. But you are using your ability to do transaction selection basically as the pool to provide additional services.
00:18:04.300 - 00:18:06.900, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Now that is funny, though.
00:18:06.932 - 00:18:26.606, Speaker A: The four megabyte block and really like what, a 3.96 megabyte picture or whatever it was, right. That caught a lot of attention. I think that really drew a lot of eyes to ordinals in general. It was, it was like a flag planning, saying, like we can do. And then, of course, the picture itself is a taproot wizards picture.
00:18:26.670 - 00:18:43.654, Speaker C: It is, yeah. It was a picture of like, the taproot wizard. And so, of course, that was, that's really like the flagship for their project. And that seems to be what other projects are interested in. They want to use that as, like the billboard say, you know, their on chain billboard for their project. And that seems to be what we're seeing here.
00:18:43.694 - 00:18:48.768, Speaker A: Are you seeing other mining pools starting to get interested in these types of ordinal focused services?
00:18:48.896 - 00:19:20.176, Speaker C: Nothing as specific as what we're doing right now. You know, I'm sure that they're talking about it because there's, you know, there's certainly Alpha to be had there. And I can't imagine or I can't imagine that we're going to be the only one seeing that. There's this opportunity to go out and, you know, generate extra reward for our miners via, you know, these, these, we call them bespoke blocks, but we can call it ripping four meggers, but we call it bespoke blocks. But it does seem like that is, you know, something that most other pools will probably start getting into just because there is alpha to be had there.
00:19:20.200 - 00:19:26.464, Speaker A: And not even just the four meggers, but just like selling out of band block space to ordinal creators.
00:19:26.504 - 00:19:53.506, Speaker C: Yes. I mean, another one that was really famous was the sequential mint that we did for D gods. So if anybody here has done any inscribing, you know that you're basically at the mercy of the mempool. You don't know what order your inscriptions are going to go in, how many blocks it's going to take, et cetera. It's basically just like spraying prayer. Yeah. What we did for d gods was we handcrafted a block that had all of their inscriptions in a particular order.
00:19:53.570 - 00:19:54.474, Speaker A: Which they wanted.
00:19:54.554 - 00:20:06.786, Speaker C: Which they wanted. Yeah. So it's super aesthetic. Like, the idea was in the. Like, when you would go to the explorer, you would just see all of their inscriptions in order. Exactly correct. The way that they asked for them to be put in.
00:20:06.810 - 00:20:09.154, Speaker A: There's no other random ones. I see.
00:20:09.274 - 00:20:18.314, Speaker C: And so if you go explore, if you go take a look at the explorer, around the time that the d gods were being minted, you'll see that they're all there. 535 of them.
00:20:18.354 - 00:20:18.778, Speaker A: In a row.
00:20:18.826 - 00:20:35.130, Speaker C: In a row, yeah. It was around 770,000 ish was when they got theirs in. And, yeah, that was really cool. That was another really kind of bespoke thing that we've done. We've had. There's been a ton of different requests for different things. I don't want to dish people's alpha yet, but there's, like, the amount of creativity that people have.
00:20:35.130 - 00:20:35.802, Speaker C: It's incredible.
00:20:35.858 - 00:20:51.854, Speaker A: It's really interesting because if you think about it, it could be a lot bigger than just this. But with the block explorers. Right. Ordinals.com or whatever the ordinary, you really have, like, a billboard dao. A giant graffiti wall. I don't want to call.
00:20:51.854 - 00:21:14.178, Speaker A: I'm not necessarily insinuating that it is graffiti, but you have a giant space, for example, for advertising. I've scrolled around there and just seen advertisements, literally, people saying, like, come trade bitcoin on this website or whatever. And so then that adds such an interesting. I mean, the ordering. You're talking about these bespoke mints.
00:21:14.226 - 00:21:17.266, Speaker C: Like, now you want to talk about ordering? Yeah.
00:21:17.290 - 00:21:19.266, Speaker A: Tell me there is a. I mean.
00:21:19.290 - 00:21:33.026, Speaker C: So zooming out just a little bit, this idea of ordinals and inscriptions. Casey has famously called it a shared hallucination, because we're all just kind of viewing data that's on the blockchain. We just happen to know how to interpret that.
00:21:33.050 - 00:21:34.538, Speaker A: We've agreed on a way to interpret it.
00:21:34.546 - 00:22:19.418, Speaker C: We've agreed on a way to interpret it. If, say, the Ord project was wiped out today and nobody was able to decode how to get those inscriptions and ordinals out of the chain, those would all just, like, go away, and they would just be, like, big transactions and nobody really know how they work. There is a protocol being implemented called BRC 20, which is trying to be like the ERC 20 of ETH on bitcoin using ordinals. I'm not saying it's a good idea, but what I'm saying is that now you do have ordering, which is important now because it is based on when those were inscribed. If you were Sam giving. I don't even know what BRC 20 tokens are out there right now. I imagine Pepe is one.
00:22:19.418 - 00:22:38.822, Speaker C: So we'll just say Pepe. We got a pepe behind me. We got a pepe behind me. I give you 20 bazillion pepes and you want to sell them that ordering needs to occur correctly within a block. So now there is ordering within transactions within a bitcoin block.
00:22:38.878 - 00:22:39.262, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:39.358 - 00:22:45.030, Speaker C: Which opens up. Now that opens up real meV. If this was catches, and this has.
00:22:45.062 - 00:23:07.376, Speaker A: Been one of the main reasons why the bitcoin community historically and the bitcoin development community has opposed adding pure tokens to bitcoin, is because it can pervert mining incentives. It can create opportunities for Mev. Yeah. And, I mean, that's not. We're well aware that that's possible. That's what's happened on basically every other chain. Right.
00:23:07.376 - 00:23:14.888, Speaker A: And I guess the question is like a. Do we. First of all, is Br. Do you know, is BRC 20, like, any good? From a technical. It's just ordinals, right?
00:23:15.016 - 00:23:16.232, Speaker C: Yeah, it's just ordinals.
00:23:16.368 - 00:23:18.528, Speaker A: So you're putting some token data instead of a picture.
00:23:18.616 - 00:23:30.312, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. The protocol is super bloated because it's. It's like JSON and text based. It doesn't need to be JSON or text based, but. And I don't know the soundness of the protocol or anything. I'm just saying that there is something out there that exists.
00:23:30.368 - 00:23:31.128, Speaker A: Ordering will happen.
00:23:31.176 - 00:23:42.606, Speaker C: There's a hallucination of hallucinations occurring. It's hallucination inception. Yeah, exactly. And then there's other stuff that's occurring on there, too. So it's been incredibly interesting to see.
00:23:42.630 - 00:23:47.502, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw people are doing, like, an EnS type like domain thing. Sat. Was it sats or something?
00:23:47.598 - 00:23:49.110, Speaker C: Sat Unisat.
00:23:49.262 - 00:23:50.554, Speaker A: There's a bunch of BTC.
00:23:51.894 - 00:24:01.662, Speaker C: There's just regular names because they were saying, we don't need to have the BTC. So that's when, if you go see a bunch of inscriptions that are all just text, it's usually something related to that.
00:24:01.718 - 00:24:13.420, Speaker A: Like that. Do you think. So you said this in the beginning about inscriptions and ordinals. But how would you view how this is impacting and will impact bitcoin culture and development in general?
00:24:13.612 - 00:24:28.788, Speaker C: Yeah. So there was some initial. I mean, certainly in the very beginning, back when we did the big wizard, it was around 600 or so. Inscription number 600. Just for reference, it's what today is the 13th. 13th. And we're about 1.1
00:24:28.788 - 00:24:53.652, Speaker C: million inscriptions. And this is what, maybe we'll say three months. Yeah, two, three months. So we have had explosive growth. But in the very beginning, there was a very vocal group that was very against inscriptions. The initial critique was that this would cause chain bloat, unnecessary chain bloat. And basically they were saying that you put your jpegs on other chains.
00:24:53.652 - 00:25:24.100, Speaker C: You don't need to put jpegs into bitcoin blocks at all. That's misuse of the bitcoin block space. And the very first time I ever met you in person was, it was like, 02:00 a.m. In Miami. And it was around the time that marathon digital was filtering transactions. Because they were worried about Ofac sanctions, they were doing what was called ofac filtering. And at that time, then and still today, I've always been a proponent of if the protocol allows it, it's a valid transaction.
00:25:24.100 - 00:25:47.224, Speaker C: Whether I agree with what's in that transaction or not doesn't matter, because in this case, code is lost. So it does seem like that critique has somewhat died down. And overall, now it's moving towards. The critique that most bitcoiners have against altcoins and other chains is that this is basically just the shitcoin de jour that would be.
00:25:48.004 - 00:25:50.660, Speaker A: They're just not desirable transactions, so we don't like them.
00:25:50.732 - 00:26:17.676, Speaker C: Yeah, well, but now they're moving on. The critique has moved on from like, okay, well, maybe this is good for miners and all that stuff. And so maybe the economics of this are, you know, and the desirability of these transactions, you know, is kind of a moot point now. But really what we're seeing now is probably. And there's already have been a lot of, like, ordinal scams. You know, a lot of the stuff that comes along with shitcoinery, the stuff that we're, you know, the stuff that you see, you know, rug pulls. And that can happen.
00:26:17.676 - 00:26:23.996, Speaker C: Yeah. Just ghosting protocol, like. Yeah, exactly. So all of that stuff can happen. And it probably already has happened in ordinal land.
00:26:24.060 - 00:26:31.828, Speaker A: Yep. So. But, you know, the tent seems to be getting bigger, and it seems like there's a culture clash.
00:26:31.956 - 00:26:32.980, Speaker C: There certainly is.
00:26:33.092 - 00:26:44.620, Speaker A: Yeah. The. The monetary maximalists who. Who want bitcoin to primarily be non sovereign, decentralized, you know, bank. Central bank. Right. Global.
00:26:44.732 - 00:26:45.316, Speaker C: Sound money.
00:26:45.380 - 00:27:06.142, Speaker A: Sound money. They. Yes. They think this is misused the same way. They didn't like Satoshi dice, you know, eight years ago or whenever that was. They didn't like oper because this was taking up important block space that should be reserved for whether it's payments or digital gold type activities. That's still a huge part of the bitcoin culture.
00:27:06.238 - 00:27:06.710, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:06.822 - 00:27:17.818, Speaker A: But now you have a giant and growing other part of this culture that is focused on art, even on tokens. To your point, art and culture and.
00:27:17.926 - 00:27:58.094, Speaker C: Tokens and all of the stuff that has generally eschewed bitcoin is now coming this way. And the .1 of the thoughts that I've had, and I've been kind of saying this behind the scenes, is the whole of bitcoin now is, let's just say that 100% of the bitcoin culture now could stay within bitcoin and still become a very small minority as new entrants come in. So say there's 100,000 bitcoiners in the world, or a million, whatever it happens to be. We add all of these other people, we go up to 10 million. That million still exists, but they're now a very small minority possible, and we're gonna have to rationalize that.
00:27:58.174 - 00:28:00.286, Speaker A: Yeah. And reckon with it.
00:28:00.430 - 00:28:01.750, Speaker C: Reckon. That's a much better word.
00:28:01.822 - 00:28:21.274, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I don't know where it goes. I think it's very interesting and exciting. Another idea I had was that we wrote about, and when we wrote about inscriptions, was that. I feel like, really, nobody knew this was possible. If you go back and read from the core devs, they did know that they had lifted the tap script witness size limit.
00:28:21.354 - 00:28:23.642, Speaker C: They knew that they did it on purpose. And I can talk about why.
00:28:23.698 - 00:28:24.338, Speaker A: Well, why?
00:28:24.466 - 00:28:35.842, Speaker C: Yeah, so they did it to compress the Utxo set. Basically, it incentivizes wallets to use up Utxos, which adds compressionary pressure to the Utxo set. There's maybe, I don't know, less time.
00:28:35.858 - 00:28:41.094, Speaker A: Sort of put more data in the witness, basically, which is prunable and not part of the Utxo.
00:28:41.714 - 00:28:46.138, Speaker C: And then it's also cheaper to craft those transactions because they get the. The segwit discount.
00:28:46.186 - 00:28:46.466, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:46.530 - 00:28:48.274, Speaker C: So that's the reason it was introduced.
00:28:48.394 - 00:29:16.608, Speaker A: But they were thinking, like, I think they were thinking complex. Like, was it like music and like all the. All the stuff that taproot and tapscript enables from like, a complex, you know, transaction, encumbrances, multisig stuff. They. No one. And I went back and looked and of course I was there. You were there during the debate around Taproot, which, by the way, not only was this not raised as a possibility, but we also activated taproot with speedy trial.
00:29:16.608 - 00:29:54.380, Speaker A: So it was even faster than theoretically it would otherwise be. And I'm pretty sure if the bitcoin community of 2021 was told that if we enable Taproot as written, you're going to get a giant explosion of a million nfts minted on bitcoin in three months, they would have rejected Taproot. So that's one of the most interesting things to me. I don't think a lot of people realized, I mean, Casey really saw the witness and what could be done with data in the witness and then came up with the ordinal theory part of it, and mixed these two together. But it seems like nobody really realized this could happen. And so. Right.
00:29:54.380 - 00:29:55.908, Speaker A: I mean, it kind of came out of nowhere.
00:29:55.996 - 00:30:01.900, Speaker C: Yeah. So he has been an ordinal theorist for a long time. Long predates this, inscriptions and all of that.
00:30:01.932 - 00:30:06.928, Speaker A: So you should have been able, if you followed Casey's work, to realize there might have been something here.
00:30:06.976 - 00:30:28.440, Speaker C: Well, so let's just. For everybody, in case. I don't know if this has been covered yet, but an ordinal is really. The ordinal theory states that you can individually identify all 2.1 quadrillion satoshis that exist via a numbering scheme. Again, it basically just has to do with, like, the very first block and has Satoshi number one, and the very last block will have Satoshi number 2.1 quadrillion.
00:30:28.440 - 00:30:46.226, Speaker C: And then all of them in between can have some number associated with them. You can introduce some rarity, like the first satoshi in a block is considered uncommon. The first satoshi of the block that starts at difficulty epoch is considered rare. There's epic, mythic, right?
00:30:46.250 - 00:30:49.458, Speaker A: Like the first set of the first having block or something.
00:30:49.586 - 00:30:53.754, Speaker C: Those are considered epics. And then there's. Yeah, there's a whole numbering scheme.
00:30:53.794 - 00:31:00.638, Speaker A: And to be honest, we could make up our own things that we like. We like the one. Cause this was in the transaction that Michael Saylor bought bitcoin with or something.
00:31:00.726 - 00:31:28.694, Speaker C: You could also. Yeah, you know, there's a. There's a group out there going out and trying to find 2009 sats that to inscribe on. So basically finding sats that are from, you know, very, very, very early in bitcoin history. So that theory, though, has been around for a long time. Like the idea that you can individually number satoshis and those satoshis he calls ordinals the key unlock was the idea that you can inscribe extra data and attach an ordinal to it. And then now that inscription is tradable.
00:31:28.694 - 00:31:42.862, Speaker C: So I can give. I can move it around now by moving around that specific, by moving that sat around, which is what makes, which is really the key unlock. And that was the thing that that kind of caused what is occurring now back in what would be, you know, end of February.
00:31:42.998 - 00:31:58.678, Speaker A: Because I, you know, I think just putting the, even without the ordinals, putting data on the chain is cool. Like, that's interesting to me. I thought it was interesting with opera turn. I meant to do it, but then I, I screwed up and there was a lot going on, but I intended to oper turn my first son's birth.
00:31:58.806 - 00:31:59.342, Speaker C: Okay.
00:31:59.438 - 00:32:08.950, Speaker A: But then, you know, we were in the hospital, and I was like, I'm on phone. I was like, I can't figure out how to do an oper transaction from my phone right now. And also my wife's like, I need. What are you doing on your phone?
00:32:08.982 - 00:32:09.878, Speaker C: Put your phone away, please.
00:32:09.966 - 00:32:11.126, Speaker A: Put your phone away.
00:32:11.310 - 00:32:12.014, Speaker C: Kind of important.
00:32:12.094 - 00:32:22.690, Speaker A: I've liked that idea. And, of course, Satoshi, I think it can be said, inscribed right in the genesis block. Right. So. And there's tons of other ones. There was for what's his face less, the developer.
00:32:22.722 - 00:32:23.378, Speaker C: Lex Sassaman.
00:32:23.426 - 00:32:36.882, Speaker A: Yes. Sassman. Yeah. Somebody inscribed a tribute to him when he passed away. There's plenty of stuff like that. And it goes back to the first block in bitcoin. I mean, Satoshi, obviously, chancellor on the brink of second bailout banks.
00:32:36.882 - 00:32:48.902, Speaker A: So I love that alone. And then, yes, but you add the ordinals and now you've got an NFT, essentially, or a token. You've got a token with data. And that is what we're seeing now.
00:32:48.998 - 00:33:16.254, Speaker C: So you mentioned, one thing I wanted to get to before we move too far away from the topic was about how the culture is shifting. And I think that if I had to, if I were a betting person right now, I think unless there's this huge influx of new blood into the ecosystem, that we're like bitcoin core, I think is ossified. I don't think that a new fork will get enough traction for a generation, most likely due, and very specifically due to what's occurring right now, partly from this.
00:33:16.414 - 00:33:30.694, Speaker A: This, too. In our report, we said it was bearish for future bips because, like, they. This wasn't seen. I think now we said, look, you could have some, but they'll be much more narrow than Taproot and Schnorr were, which was a pretty gargantuan upgrade. Right.
00:33:30.734 - 00:33:30.934, Speaker C: Like.
00:33:30.974 - 00:33:41.038, Speaker A: But maybe. Maybe you'll get some narrow ones that just do a little thing here and there. But, like, this, the outcome here being so unexpected to the majority of the community, I think people are going to be very, very skeptical.
00:33:41.126 - 00:33:46.424, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. Shout out Jeremy Rubin. I unfortunately think that his bip has been pushed out even further now.
00:33:46.504 - 00:34:22.383, Speaker A: Yeah. And I do like vaulted custody and other types of encumbrances like that and covenants, whether that's CTV or op vault. Is that James Ob's proposal? Somebody. There's some good ones that are interesting. I think they add a lot of powerful features to bitcoin encumbrancing, which is important for things like you want to build a certain type of L2 on bitcoin, you would need something like that. But, yeah, I mean, people find them interesting. I think it's going to take a lot of work to get the community on board with that.
00:34:22.683 - 00:34:41.526, Speaker C: Yeah. But that community might become a minority, and we'll see. As if this thing. If in a year from now we have 50 million inscriptions, there's 50 million new people. Well, maybe not exactly 50, but there's a lot that encompasses a very large group.
00:34:41.630 - 00:34:49.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. We could keep talking about inscriptions and ordinals a lot. I know. I think we'll both be in Miami for the. For bitcoin and some.
00:34:50.014 - 00:34:50.406, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:50.510 - 00:34:50.934, Speaker A: Stuff.
00:34:51.014 - 00:34:51.582, Speaker C: We will.
00:34:51.678 - 00:35:01.782, Speaker A: So we'll. There'll be more on this. Yep. But I do want to get into it a little bit on Luxor and mining and bitcoin in general. I mean, so what are the. You guys have great stuff. You have the.
00:35:01.782 - 00:35:19.416, Speaker A: I love the hash price. You have a great dashboard with information. So a bunch of good data from Luxor, too. What's the most interesting thing about running a mining pool in your mind? What is it like being a mining pool operator? I mean, your customers are miners, right? Yeah, our customers are customer service.
00:35:19.480 - 00:35:35.600, Speaker C: Our customers are miners. We have customer service. We have telegram, discord, email, a lot of things like that. So the point you mentioned. So you said the dashboards, when you're talking about that, that's actually a property. We have called hashrateindex.com dot, and we try to track all of the metrics related to mining.
00:35:35.600 - 00:36:25.442, Speaker C: If you go there now, you can see that transaction fees as a percent of block reward are certainly up, especially because mostly attributable to inscriptions, something we haven't really talked about or anybody has really talked about yet. Is now that there are all of these inscriptions, all the marketplaces are coming, and that's going to drive a lot of transaction volume as well. So aside from actually putting the data onto the chain, if we're out trading and doing all of this NFT activity that you see on other chains, that's also going to set another really strong floor for mining. And those types of transactions are actually going to be much more beneficial to miners than the actual inscriptions because they won't be getting the discount. And there's an incentive to pay up. Where with inscriptions, you're like, I don't really care if it just needs to.
00:36:25.458 - 00:36:31.886, Speaker A: Get out eventually, even within a day. But yes, if I'm doing trading or any kind of financial activity, yeah, if.
00:36:31.910 - 00:36:34.558, Speaker C: I'm selling you a twelve fold, I want that confirmed like the next.
00:36:34.606 - 00:36:36.302, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to know that I got it right away.
00:36:36.358 - 00:36:41.334, Speaker C: So I'll pay $100 to, you know, to get that done. Where now people are like, I mean.
00:36:41.374 - 00:36:49.686, Speaker A: And that's what we see on Ethereum, particularly around minting, too. But also in general, I mean, high value transactions people pay up for.
00:36:49.790 - 00:36:50.126, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:50.190 - 00:36:51.854, Speaker A: Or what we call high time preference.
00:36:52.014 - 00:36:52.754, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:53.734 - 00:37:06.136, Speaker A: So, but okay. As a pool, though, I agree. What is the. Okay, so explain to me how the, you can, what do they call it? The way you do payouts. Right. There's two main ways that payouts occur, right?
00:37:06.160 - 00:37:06.432, Speaker C: Yep.
00:37:06.488 - 00:37:08.064, Speaker A: So there's one very popular one.
00:37:08.144 - 00:37:10.208, Speaker C: There's two. Yeah. The PPS pay per share.
00:37:10.256 - 00:37:10.728, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:37:10.816 - 00:37:56.286, Speaker C: Basically, we can ascribe, every time a miner submits a bit of data, they submit a share every three to 5 seconds. We can ascribe some value to that share based on the current economics, basically what, what transaction fees are and what the network difficulty is. You can say, I know this share has x percent of a chance of solving the block. We can give you that much value for it. It's mathematically equivalent to guessing lottery numbers. And you know that if I'm buying lottery tickets, I know how much one has, how much likelihood the likelihood is, and then I can describe a value to each of those tickets. Famously, the lotteries have been getting much larger, partially probably due to inflation, but the value of each of those tickets is actually greater than the value that you purchased it for.
00:37:56.286 - 00:38:08.582, Speaker C: Maybe if you don't take out taxes and things like that, because the value of the reward is so high. But anyway, so that's paper share. You're basically paying for a hash rate upfront regardless whether you find blocks or not.
00:38:08.598 - 00:38:09.230, Speaker A: Got it.
00:38:09.382 - 00:38:38.730, Speaker C: Then there's a less common but more historically utilized method called Ppl and S. Also, there's some places do props, but ppl and S stands for pay per last and shares. And basically what that means is that over the last, you know, say, seven days worth of shares, I grab up a bag of them, and if I, if I submitted 10% of those shares and we hit a block, you. I get 10%. You know, say you had the other 90, you would get 90% minus, of course, the.
00:38:38.762 - 00:38:46.092, Speaker A: So sort of like, rather than paying upfront based on the likelihood, it's like we just literally look and say, like, what money did we make? And then you get a proportional.
00:38:46.218 - 00:39:08.280, Speaker C: Yep, exactly. And so then in that, in that way, we say that miners are then bearing the luck risk. Basically, mine and mining is a probabilistic game where some days you mine a lot of blocks, some days you don't mine a lot of blocks. And in pps, the mining pool handles that. Basically, they shield the miners from the doubt. It's all smoothed out entirely. Yep.
00:39:08.280 - 00:39:43.514, Speaker C: Obviously that does come with counterparty risk. You have to, like, trust your pools, like managing their bankroll and all that stuff effectively, but in the long term, it should work out. The converse is true as well with ppl and S. So if you're ppl and s, you don't find a block for a while. People are like, oh, is the pool broken? What's going on here? If brains doesn't find a block for a couple days, their support chats are going wild with people thinking the pool is broken or something like that. It just happens to be an unlucky streak. And then, of course, when they hit five blocks in a day, nobody's like, oh, is the pool broken? We find too many blocks.
00:39:43.514 - 00:40:02.116, Speaker C: But, yeah, so those are the two payment mechanisms. PPS is certainly the largest. I would say it's probably 90 ish percent of all hash rate, probably 10% of hashrate, maybe a little more is solo mine. You've got marathon kind of solo mining now and a couple of other pools that are doing their own mining.
00:40:02.220 - 00:40:05.908, Speaker A: I mean, I guess if you're really big, you could solo mine.
00:40:05.956 - 00:40:19.396, Speaker C: It does start to make sense. Yeah, it does start to make sense, especially because of the fee that you would be charged. It starts to add up pretty quickly as well as there's a lot of data that produce. And it would be nice to, to really own all of that data, maybe.
00:40:19.420 - 00:40:21.100, Speaker A: Not link it to the pool or whatever.
00:40:21.212 - 00:40:54.022, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, there are, you know, some of the big miners when they're mining it at foundry or even luxor. They try to mask, you know, information about the miners. They don't want to say, you know, you know, s 19 XP on particular rack. They try to code name them and things like that so that you don't. The pool doesn't have any information about what's underneath there. But so, yeah, that's, you know, and, you know, most, they don't really try to mass ips or anything like that, but they do certainly sometimes try to make it a little ambiguous what they're doing, just because the more data you leak to the world, the more attack vectors you have.
00:40:54.198 - 00:41:29.284, Speaker A: And it's a highly competitive industry. It's almost purely competitive. It's just work. It's proof of computation, and that's very competitive. I get that. What do you think about the future of bitcoin mining pools and fold in the stratum V two question? Which, that time in Miami, we were arguing about, one, do you think we'll get stratum V two? Is there something else that's coming? Is there something, from a technological standpoint, in the mining market structure? What's it going to look like in the future? Is it any different in your mind.
00:41:32.824 - 00:41:45.604, Speaker C: Right now? I think that pool, obviously, we're maybe less than a week away from foundry announcing that they are turning on fees for the first time. Their fee tiers are out there now. There's a timeline, which is end of the month.
00:41:47.344 - 00:41:53.216, Speaker A: There have been no fees at all, and that's contributed largely a big contributing factor to their growth, to their success.
00:41:53.280 - 00:42:04.204, Speaker C: Yeah. So that has been. And they were getting close to 35, 40% of the network, which started to cause people to have some uncertainty about, is that bad?
00:42:05.704 - 00:42:22.342, Speaker A: And it is bad, by the way. There was a previous time when a bitcoin mining pool got up to, like, 50 or 55% years ago. And sex ceX, right. Yeah. And, like, the miners pulled together and said, we're gonna. We're gonna move and diversify because we don't want it to be that centralized.
00:42:22.398 - 00:42:31.614, Speaker C: So what they did. So that was, that was g hash and G hash and Cexx IO, and they. I think they split and then, you know, they still had more than 50%, but.
00:42:31.654 - 00:42:36.934, Speaker A: Yeah, but at least it was technically separate. Yeah, yeah. So, so they're adding the fee schedule.
00:42:36.974 - 00:42:57.766, Speaker C: Adding the fee, which phone's pretty much been ringing off the hook ever since then. I'm sure other pools are doing the same thing happening there. Miners are very, very monetarily motivated, meaning if you have zero fee like, that's the only competitive advantage you need. You don't need to add features. Doesn't matter. Miners, very, very few. Almost no miner we've ever had.
00:42:57.766 - 00:43:12.662, Speaker C: The few miners, the miners that we do have, have joined because of the features that we have. But ultimately, at the end of the day, having 0% fee is one of the biggest things that you can do for your miners. But we just can't run, you know? You know, we don't have a genesis. We don't have.
00:43:12.798 - 00:43:17.334, Speaker A: Right. So the foundry is a subsidiary of digital currency Group. So they had other.
00:43:17.494 - 00:43:17.918, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:17.966 - 00:43:23.838, Speaker A: You know, other things they were doing in order to earn money, et cetera. Yeah, right. But you guys are a bitcoin mining pool company.
00:43:23.926 - 00:43:24.198, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:24.246 - 00:43:25.230, Speaker A: And other stuff now, but.
00:43:25.262 - 00:43:42.938, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And so that's, you know, that was your revenue. Yeah, exactly. And so you were kind of getting to the point of, like, what do you think about running a mining pool? It's a terrible business. It's a very difficult business. You have to have effectively 100% uptime. It's very hard to have a business where the expectations are so high and the propensity to pay is so low.
00:43:43.026 - 00:43:47.682, Speaker A: Yeah. And so much money is at stake. Right. I mean, one block is a lot of money.
00:43:47.738 - 00:44:00.474, Speaker C: What, 200k maybe. Yeah. You know, seven ish, let's say seven ish. Bitcoin, six and a half. Seven bitcoin today. You know, that's, what, between $180 to $210,000. So, yeah, if you mess that up, that's become very expensive very quickly.
00:44:00.474 - 00:44:04.138, Speaker C: Actually, f. Two pool has recently rejected a few blocks.
00:44:04.186 - 00:44:07.762, Speaker A: I saw this. They had, or they had submitted, I guess, invalid blocks.
00:44:07.818 - 00:44:09.650, Speaker C: Two of them. Yeah, of them, yeah, two of them.
00:44:09.682 - 00:44:10.650, Speaker A: That's a huge error.
00:44:10.722 - 00:44:22.530, Speaker C: Yeah. So what they. So what happened was they have. They construct. Most certainly they're not constructing blocks with bitcoin core, which we are. Most. Most pools do, but they're constructing their own blocks, and they.
00:44:22.530 - 00:44:40.422, Speaker C: There's a Sigop limit, and I think it's 80,000 sigops that you can include in a block. There was another protocol, somewhat similar to ordinals called stamps that was doing, which required a lot of sigops. And I think they just didn't have that check in their code because who the hell is going to put 80,000 Sig ops in a. In a block?
00:44:40.478 - 00:44:42.726, Speaker A: Some new protocol that they weren't fully aware of. Yeah.
00:44:42.790 - 00:44:46.462, Speaker C: Yeah. And so they ended up rejecting two. They submitted two invalid blocks.
00:44:46.478 - 00:44:48.246, Speaker A: I mean, that's losing almost half a million dollars.
00:44:48.310 - 00:44:48.862, Speaker C: Close yeah.
00:44:48.918 - 00:45:00.038, Speaker A: Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. So stratum. Let's talk about stratum a little bit. So stratum is the protocol, the technology protocol, messaging protocol that miners use to communicate with pools.
00:45:00.086 - 00:45:12.794, Speaker C: Right. And I would say probably 98% of hashrate uses. 99% of hashrate uses stratum. We call it stratum V one. Yeah. Based. It's a text based protocol, which is not optimal.
00:45:12.794 - 00:45:16.238, Speaker C: Old. I mean, it was. Yeah. Being old is fine.
00:45:16.286 - 00:45:19.494, Speaker A: I know, but it was designed for a wholly different, like, mining era.
00:45:19.574 - 00:45:20.342, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:45:20.398 - 00:45:24.758, Speaker A: So at this level of hash rate and scale, if we started from scratch, we would probably design it differently.
00:45:24.806 - 00:45:29.798, Speaker C: Yeah. We would use what we call a binary protocol. Like, you can compress this protocol, like. Like something like 80%.
00:45:29.846 - 00:45:31.366, Speaker A: And that would make it more efficient.
00:45:31.470 - 00:45:44.756, Speaker C: Yeah, just make it more efficient. You wouldn't have, like, your. Your switch gear would not be under as much stress. You wouldn't have as much ingress or egress. So, like, miners that mine, maybe they're not connected to, like, fiber optic. They're connected via, like, a 5g connection or 4g connection.
00:45:44.780 - 00:45:46.260, Speaker A: Right. Like, if they're off the grid somewhere.
00:45:46.292 - 00:45:48.584, Speaker C: Off the grid. And, you know, North Dakota or whatever.
00:45:48.924 - 00:45:53.284, Speaker A: Meaningful reduction in the amount of data that you have to send back and forth would be. Would help.
00:45:53.364 - 00:46:03.396, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's. I mean, it's certainly so. I know you're kind of pushing me over into this direction where I've been a little bit. I'm not. I'm not a. I wouldn't say you're critical.
00:46:03.396 - 00:46:04.820, Speaker C: I'm not critical of v two.
00:46:04.852 - 00:46:06.356, Speaker A: I don't think it's as good as people say.
00:46:06.460 - 00:46:15.914, Speaker C: Yeah, it's not going to solve the problems that people think that it will, but it will solve a lot of problems, and I think it's a meaningful and important upgrade. So I want to be on the record to say that I think I.
00:46:15.914 - 00:46:19.714, Speaker A: Am baiting Nick a little bit, because when we first talked in Miami, this is what we were arguing about.
00:46:19.754 - 00:46:27.130, Speaker C: Right. I do think that stratum V two is a meaningful and important upgrade for the network, and I do support it, and I want people to start, you know, I want it to happen.
00:46:27.202 - 00:46:35.784, Speaker A: But what are the things that people have said that it will do that? What have they said? How has it been billed versus what is the reality?
00:46:37.284 - 00:47:09.502, Speaker C: So let's talk about some of the features that stratum V two has. It has connection multiplexing, which basically means that you can do multiple. You can serve multiple miners over a single connection. It also has binary support, it has reconnect, it has fast failover. It has all of these awesome features that are really good things for mining to happen. But the only thing people actually care about when it comes to stratum V two is what we call job negotiation or transaction selection, which means that the miner on their side are the ones that get to select which transactions go into the blocks. But that's not exactly what happens.
00:47:09.502 - 00:47:33.442, Speaker C: The pool sends you a job template and says, these are the transactions that you're working on. And if for whatever reason, the transaction that the miner isn't, you know, if there's a specific transaction that a miner wants included in the, in the block, they could put it in, they could propose to the pool that they add this, and then the pool will say, yep, okay, here's a new template. You can start working on this one that includes all the transactions that you want.
00:47:33.618 - 00:47:36.650, Speaker A: The pool still is sending it back to them to work on.
00:47:36.842 - 00:47:58.850, Speaker C: Ultimately, there's a negotiation process between the miner and the pool. The thought here is the reason sovereign bitcoin maximalists want this to occur is because it takes power away from the pool, which is great. I want all of the power to be taken away from our pool. Uh, we don't want to have, like, we basically just want to be a facility.
00:47:58.922 - 00:48:15.346, Speaker A: Well, there's liability, right? I mean, because the block, uh, proposer, if we use like Ethereum language or whatever, this, right, the pool is selecting the transactions that go into the block. And this goes to the point you made about marathon digital and how then, well, they said, well, crap, maybe we don't want some of these transactions in our blocks. Right? So they started censoring some transactions.
00:48:15.410 - 00:48:15.770, Speaker C: Yep.
00:48:15.842 - 00:49:02.710, Speaker A: Well, not censoring, just not putting those ones in their blocks. Like, I don't know if that counts as censorship specifically, but that's the idea, is that there's an attack vector on bitcoiners, bitcoin transactors, which is you go to the pool, let's say you're a government or whatever, and you say, we don't like Alex. It's illegal for you to include any of Alex's transactions in the block. And I think bitcoiners, they fast forward in their minds and they say, it's not too difficult to think of a world where there's widespread censorship enforced on bitcoin through the miner, through the mining pool. So the idea is, well, if we can move that block proposal part of the lifecycle out to the spokes, which is the individual miners, then that would be much more resilient and resistant to that type of censorship. That's the idea. That's how it's pitched.
00:49:02.782 - 00:49:24.706, Speaker C: Exactly. The idea is great, but the pool is still going to reject that transaction if they're told to, if they're told to by their government. So I think that pools still will have to operate within some regulatory environment, whether that's the US or Russia or China or wherever they happen to be, their pool still needs to exist, and they'll ultimately just reject that during that negotiation process.
00:49:24.770 - 00:49:26.450, Speaker A: They'll just keep saying no to adding that transaction.
00:49:26.482 - 00:49:38.722, Speaker C: They'll say no. Yeah. So if you want to. So then the proposal then from the v two team that's been working on this job negotiation, job negotiation protocol, is that the miner can fall back to a backup pool. And I think that's a great idea.
00:49:38.738 - 00:49:40.082, Speaker A: So that's just literally to a different pool.
00:49:40.138 - 00:49:41.010, Speaker C: That's just to a different pool.
00:49:41.042 - 00:49:41.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:41.274 - 00:49:42.490, Speaker C: So I think that that's ultimately.
00:49:42.562 - 00:49:51.070, Speaker A: So diversity of pools in different jurisdictions is probably a better hedge against that type of censorship than purely sv two transaction selection.
00:49:51.142 - 00:50:07.414, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And really, I guess transaction selection, though, does give you more of an overt indication that a pool is censoring the transaction. That might be maybe a benefit, because up to now, if a pool doesn't include a transaction, like maybe they weren't connected to the peer or.
00:50:07.454 - 00:50:08.518, Speaker A: It's not obvious why.
00:50:08.606 - 00:50:32.842, Speaker C: The mempool is very ephemeral. The mempool is not the mempool. You have your mempool and you have your mempool, and we all have shared. We have a lot of shared transactions, but they're never exactly the same because of the latency in the network. The one in China, it was different than the one in Russia is different than mine. So if a transaction isn't included, you can't say, oh, obviously, this is why. Obviously it was being censored.
00:50:32.842 - 00:50:39.146, Speaker C: But in the case of v two, then a miner would be basically notified that transaction is invalid, and we won't.
00:50:39.170 - 00:50:51.522, Speaker A: It was rejected. So that's interesting. It is interesting and it's improvement, but it doesn't give you that self sovereign resistance that it's often pitched as having. So, you know, you want that you.
00:50:51.538 - 00:50:57.722, Speaker C: Need to introduce like shielded pools or shielded transactions, kind of like ZK privacy or.
00:50:57.818 - 00:51:00.514, Speaker A: Yeah, or even a decentralized mining pool. I think there's been some.
00:51:00.554 - 00:51:18.066, Speaker C: Yeah, there's p two pool does that. But again, unfortunately, that it's just not scalable. The amount of data, like the amount of data that we end up harnessing at the end of a day is incredible talking. Billions of rows, billions and billions of shares that we collect every single day have to be indexed. So you need to make sense because.
00:51:18.090 - 00:51:20.410, Speaker A: All these computations, it's like every single.
00:51:20.522 - 00:51:39.248, Speaker C: So if you imagine we have somewhere around 150 to 180,000 mining machines connected to the pool at any point in time, those are submitting a piece of data every three to 5 seconds, that number starts to balloon very, very quickly into what we now effectively have as a big data problem. We are a big like kind of.
00:51:39.296 - 00:51:40.712, Speaker A: A data company, basically.
00:51:40.808 - 00:51:50.536, Speaker C: Yeah. So we've, you know, we built up incredibly robust data pipelines to ingest all this stuff, analyze it and then warehouse it. So we're one of the few use.
00:51:50.560 - 00:51:52.648, Speaker A: It and turn it into bitcoin blocks. Right.
00:51:52.736 - 00:51:53.776, Speaker C: Well that's. That's all.
00:51:53.840 - 00:51:54.984, Speaker A: Amazing amount of stuff, though.
00:51:55.024 - 00:51:58.792, Speaker C: That all happens in real time, right? That has to be done like immediately in real time. So you've.
00:51:58.848 - 00:52:01.360, Speaker A: We basically you're saying you're still you, but you're still holding it.
00:52:01.392 - 00:52:17.804, Speaker C: So we take. Yeah, so the stratum, you know, the stratum collects a share immediately checks to see if it's a valid block or not. And if it is, then a whole bunch another, a whole bunch of other stuff starts to occur. Right. You know, broadcast the block, immediately submit what? We immediately submit it. But then we also do, we call shotgun. So we shotgun it to a bunch of different nodes all over the world.
00:52:17.964 - 00:52:19.436, Speaker A: Make sure everyone sees it first.
00:52:19.500 - 00:52:39.612, Speaker C: Everyone sees it really, really quickly. You know, we have, you know, all of these nodes are running on like high performance servers with, you know, wow. You know, Nvme, nvme SsD's and all that sort of stuff. But that's like table stakes for bitcoin mining. What I'm talking about is the share data. Once the share has been validated, it's not a block, it's just regular share. It's just a proof of work.
00:52:39.612 - 00:52:56.772, Speaker C: You can store that. You can, and we do store that as an atomic row in a big, huge, huge database table somewhere that ends up. We end up producing an archive. We archive all of that stuff and then we can produce reports based on it in the future.
00:52:56.868 - 00:53:01.704, Speaker A: It's crazy. The amount of data. Now that I think about it, it's just got to be insane amount of data.
00:53:02.124 - 00:53:06.524, Speaker C: You know, it's on the order of tens of terabytes. You know, it's very, very large.
00:53:06.604 - 00:53:07.036, Speaker A: Wow.
00:53:07.140 - 00:53:14.036, Speaker C: And it's fully indexed. That's the thing like producing ten terabytes is like, one thing, but having, like, a way to search that in real time quickly.
00:53:14.100 - 00:53:26.004, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. That's insane. So the other thing that I hear about, and I think you've sort of referenced it a little bit regarding latency, is that there, aren't there some efficiency gains here from stratum V two just because it's faster?
00:53:26.124 - 00:53:52.452, Speaker C: Yeah, certainly. So since it's a, obviously, since it is a binary protocol, it's less data travels through the pipes faster because there's, let's say it's much more efficient in that regard. And then, of course, when I mentioned dang it, I think we call, I've called it connection multiplexing. I think they have a different term for it. But basically, the idea is that current stuff. Yeah. If I get disconnected, I can immediately reconnect.
00:53:52.452 - 00:54:23.464, Speaker C: Where. Now, the protocol for reconnection is not great. There are some improvements that we have made, but not great. Basically, it's kind of hacking some things together, and not all machines support reconnect. And also, the pool failover is also very important. The way that you can failover to a backup pool is really good because you can keep a persistent connection open in v two a lot more easily than you can in v one where v one, you kind of have to be having these keep alives and things like that where. So it's definitely a big improvement to efficiency.
00:54:23.464 - 00:54:39.726, Speaker C: I mean, but we're talking on the, our pool average is like 99.2. Sorry, 99.92% across the pool. So, I mean, we're talking on the order of, like, single bps here. 0.01% is one bip. We're talking maybe on the order of.
00:54:39.750 - 00:54:47.270, Speaker A: Like, at the very end is a selling point. A little underwhelming. Worth it, but not like some radical game changer.
00:54:47.342 - 00:55:11.686, Speaker C: Well, to be fair, the top tier for foundry's fee for the largest pools is 15 bits. So we're talking, like, when. And that's going to be a meaningful portion of revenue for them. And so certainly bps are very important at the mining level, especially at large scale. But it's not like we're going from 95% efficiency or 90% efficiency. We're talking about, like, razor thin margins, though, or the very razor's edge here.
00:55:11.750 - 00:55:20.718, Speaker A: Yeah. Nick, before we wrap, couple other quick questions. So, first of all, where can people find you and learn about Luxor and stuff?
00:55:20.766 - 00:55:24.574, Speaker C: Yeah, so we're, you know, you can just go to Luxor tech if you want to. Luxor. Definitely.
00:55:24.614 - 00:55:27.150, Speaker A: Check out hashrateindex.com dot hashrateindex.com.
00:55:27.182 - 00:55:36.486, Speaker C: Dot. If you want to learn about ordinals, you can go to ordinalhub.com dot. You can also find us on Twitter. Twitter is luxor tech team. We've got, at ordinal hub, we've got hashrate index. You find me.
00:55:36.486 - 00:55:37.950, Speaker C: I'm Ash Bender.
00:55:38.022 - 00:55:38.782, Speaker A: Hash bender.
00:55:38.918 - 00:55:44.390, Speaker C: Yep. And yeah, so happy to chat about any of this stuff, you know, ordinals.
00:55:44.462 - 00:55:53.502, Speaker A: A lot of exciting stuff with ordinal hub and the inscriptions. I mean, that's, it's. Mining has not been this interesting in a while. That was a real game changer.
00:55:53.558 - 00:55:54.094, Speaker C: Yep.
00:55:54.214 - 00:56:07.282, Speaker A: And there's more to come. I think Luxor is, I mean, you ripped the four megar. Um, you've got some bespoke ordinals, you bought ordinal hub and the team there, you're going to be a player in this. You are a player. You are the mining player.
00:56:07.338 - 00:56:19.170, Speaker C: Yeah, we're Here. We're here for it. We're Here for it. I mean, we never, we didn't really get it. We don't have time for it to get into like, what ordinal hub is going to be like. It's probably not going to be a marketplace right now because I don't know what those marketplaces are going to look like.
00:56:19.202 - 00:56:40.772, Speaker A: But yeah, we didn't talk about the marketplace question either. I mean, obviously you have some, some bespoke ordinal marketplaces have already shown up, some coming out of the stacks ecosystem, which makes sense. They had an Nft like gamma and a few others. You have the really cool ord swap and some of the. What's the one that has the, pioneered the use of pspt?
00:56:40.828 - 00:56:41.452, Speaker C: OPEN ordeX.
00:56:41.508 - 00:56:42.892, Speaker A: Open ordex is cool.
00:56:42.948 - 00:56:45.068, Speaker C: That one's REALLY cool. It's a Windows 95.
00:56:45.116 - 00:56:50.564, Speaker A: Also magic Eden, the largest NFT marketplaces in the Solana ecosystem. Adding ordal support.
00:56:50.644 - 00:56:52.292, Speaker C: Honestly, it's probably the best one right now.
00:56:52.348 - 00:57:22.800, Speaker A: And we have to assume that Opensea will get here too. Yeah. So that, that marketplace battle for ordinals is going to get really interesting. Get some highly open source ones, like open or Dex, you've got some, some established but sort of bitcoin adjacent stacks ecosystem ones. Then you've got the, the tradfi NFT marketplaces like Opensea that you have to assume will get involved or blur, and that's gonna be wild. So, so what, I don't know what you're willing to share about ordinal hub.
00:57:22.872 - 00:57:40.704, Speaker C: Yeah, so, so, yeah, ordinal hub. Right now, we basically, like, I've already said it, like, basically just want to be the hub and to go learn three verticals, explore, discover, and then market. Market, meaning not marketplace, but. So explore is like learning about all ordinals, like what's available, what's been minted.
00:57:40.744 - 00:57:44.488, Speaker A: Recently, what is the data block exploring type stuff.
00:57:44.536 - 00:57:56.032, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Maybe like Etherscan or Mempool for ordinals, but specifically with the ordinals lens. And then of course we have discover, which is learning more about a particular project. So you get to learn about.
00:57:56.088 - 00:57:58.320, Speaker A: So I can say, oh, man, I want to learn about the ordinal loops.
00:57:58.352 - 00:58:29.744, Speaker C: Or the tables or whatever. When were they inscribed? How many are there? Who owns which ones right now? How many transfers have there been? And then market. Market is going to be marketplace data. So it's going to be trying to aggregate up all of the activity that's been occurring, allow you to drill in, understand, you know, okay, this is the, if I need to sell a rare pepe or a bitcoin punk or a twelve fold or whatever, which market has all the liquidity?
