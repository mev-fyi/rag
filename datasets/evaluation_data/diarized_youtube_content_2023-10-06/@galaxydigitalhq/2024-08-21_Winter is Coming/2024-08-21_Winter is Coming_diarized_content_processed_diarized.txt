00:00:00.360 - 00:00:27.313, Speaker A: And so now the market's kind of moving on and kind of looking at retail sales and employment figures. Retail sales are out tomorrow. You also have initial jobless claims and other employment data coming out over the next couple of weeks. And so I think the focus of the market is going to start moving more towards the employment side of the mandate because the price stuff kind of seems like it's settling down and yeah and I think market reactions were pretty benign and all.
00:00:27.329 - 00:00:39.341, Speaker B: Of that is supportive of cuts right? I mean if employment is unemployment is rising, prices are flattening, cooling then it looks like green light for easing right?
00:00:39.413 - 00:00:40.445, Speaker A: Yes absolutely.
00:00:40.525 - 00:00:55.589, Speaker B: And is that the main macro story? I mean are we still concerned about the carry trade in Japan or I guess there's global, there's geopolitical questions but like it feels like now we're in a cuts, cuts are coming, winter is coming, the cuts are coming right.
00:00:55.637 - 00:00:55.715, Speaker A: Like.
