00:00:08.360 - 00:00:49.394, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. It's a dream. We got the whole team on the scene got Christine and she's always giving us deets. We got Zach here to tell us how they're bringing treasure. Reese on chain on game, got the RWA oh, hey, coinbase using lightning to pay see me getting sporty through a portal rick and morty talking ordinals with Gabe soon inscriptions will be 40 millie an orange pill in every cell you got el twos are super hot now and Chuck infuses thought battle tested, never bested every time we do this and my homie Mister Lucas Spittin AI in the booth it's the truth that the team is the dirty half dozen. The whole movement is my family and all of us are cousins. The team is just the meanest, filthy genius with the pen, and the dream is for a future.
00:00:49.394 - 00:01:18.306, Speaker A: We're intermediary Zand. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firm wide research at Galaxy Digital. Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. Great show for you today. You might have noticed from the wrap, but we have the entire Galaxy research team on this episode to talk about a range of interesting topics that are current right now across the crypto world. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. But before we get to all that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes.

This is a great episode. We're going to cover a range of topics like Ethereum development and AI and crypto. What overlap is there? Bitcoin ordinals L2 developments and a whole bunch more. So let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnett, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:45.050 - 00:01:45.938, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:46.026 - 00:01:57.596, Speaker A: So, I guess, you know, you see over my shoulder in the block clock, you know, we're unchained unchanged basically week over week in bitcoin. But we did have macro news today. We had CPI. What was the reading? What happened?
00:01:57.700 - 00:02:23.844, Speaker B: Yeah, so inflation came in slightly higher than expected. Core inflation in particular printed a 0.3 month on month versus expectations of 0.2. Headline came in at 0.6%, which is very high. The market reaction to it has been a little confusing. Initially, rates moved higher and then they moved lower.
00:02:23.844 - 00:02:43.032, Speaker B: And same thing with stocks. They sold off because inflation means higher for longer, more aggressive Fed policy. And now they're actually up on the day. And so it's one of those numbers that I think people looked at. They're like, inflation's still hot, but we have tight monetary policy, so it's really not going to change things too much.
00:02:43.088 - 00:02:44.280, Speaker A: It wasn't high enough to change things.
00:02:44.312 - 00:02:59.600, Speaker B: Wasn't high enough. In terms of specific highlights from the report, airline fares showed a pretty dramatic jump after pretty weak July. They were up 4.9% month on month versus being down 8% the prior period.
00:02:59.672 - 00:03:00.824, Speaker A: That's a lot. Month over month.
00:03:00.864 - 00:03:34.958, Speaker B: Month over month, yeah, that's 5%. Basically. That's a big, big jump. In addition, headlines up because oil prices have been moving a lot higher. You've got WTI crude at dollar 89 a barrel and brandt like 91, and that impacts a ton of things. And then most importantly though, the area that folks, the everyday person is most concerned with is like shelter. And you still had a pretty reasonable rise in owner's equivalent rent of 0.4%
00:03:34.958 - 00:04:16.590, Speaker B: month on month. And then the Fed is really focused on inflation x services, inflation x shelter. So without including the housing component and the services portion of the core CPI was 0.4 month on month too. A reasonably firm reading. And then throw that together with a labor market that's historically one of the tightest ever. And it's like, yeah, hire for longer still makes sense, but there's so much baked in in terms of cuts that given the absolute levels of where we're at, I think you can still justify those kind of cuts.
00:04:16.590 - 00:04:58.892, Speaker B: Because, for example, the one year, one year interest rate forward puts us interest rates at 430, which is 100 basis points lower than where we're at now in change. I could easily see us cutting 100 basis points in nine months from now or a year, 16 months, that kind of stuff. I think that right now the market is fairly priced in a lot of different areas. The dollar has had a huge move. It's rallied a lot. I still think that's the, the path of least resistance. But this week you actually got pretty dramatic pushback from the BOJ and from the PBOC or China in general.
00:04:58.892 - 00:05:25.774, Speaker B: The BOJ talked about the end of negative interest rates over the weekend. They talked about it, yes, in the context of if we achieve our inflation target, which they're above, but they're like consistent staying in that inflation, they'll consider raising from negative interest rates. And then the Chinese basically were telling folks to sell dollars.
00:05:27.274 - 00:05:28.962, Speaker A: So there's some defensiveness there.
00:05:29.018 - 00:06:15.776, Speaker B: Defensiveness, absolutely. And that's just the reality of trading dollars, is you've got lots of folks that have an incentive to defend their currency, that have huge dollar reserves. And so as we go higher in these currency rates, you will see more aggressive action if the dollar continues to hold its strength. And to be honest, I keep thinking about it. In a world absent capital controls, the dollar would be just so much higher right now in the sense that we've never been as sort of technologically advanced. Like, the reason why folks are so worried about bank runs now is a bank run can happen in like an hour.
00:06:15.840 - 00:06:16.064, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:16.104 - 00:06:18.264, Speaker B: Because everybody on their cell phones can move.
00:06:18.344 - 00:06:22.744, Speaker A: Right. You don't have to walk down there and push your way into the Bailey savings and loan or whatever.
00:06:22.784 - 00:06:32.696, Speaker B: No, no, no. Like, even, even during the financial crisis, I can't tell you the amount of people that I know that, like, went to the physical bank to do transactions, get cash or whatever.
00:06:32.720 - 00:06:34.168, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. You mean even like 15 years ago?
00:06:34.216 - 00:07:14.650, Speaker B: 15 years ago, yeah. And so the idea now, it's like, okay, if you're in Europe and you have an easy way to convert to dollars, let's say via stables or something, there's a ton of people that would m nations if you gave all of the chinese rich people an easy avenue to convert to dollars, like right now, I'd tell you dollar c and h would rip like crazy. And so we live in a world that is very controlled from a capital standpoint, and these governments have a pretty strong incentive to keep those controls. And that's why you'll never see things like interest bearing stablecoins, because that would just destroy banking.
00:07:14.762 - 00:07:19.698, Speaker A: Well, there have been an announcement or two of some non us ones, which is kind of interesting.
00:07:19.746 - 00:07:22.098, Speaker B: No, I love the idea. I mean, it makes sense.
00:07:22.186 - 00:07:26.490, Speaker A: But I think your point is being that there will be defense against that by these nations. Right?
00:07:26.522 - 00:07:36.294, Speaker B: Yeah. Also, just vested interest from folks like payment processors, people that make the middleman, is what crypto is after.
00:07:36.834 - 00:07:54.530, Speaker A: Holy grails, though, that interest bearing, stable coin. Oh, it is the holy grail because it combines the interest bearing nature of, say, like, short term bonds with the fluidity, high speed fluidity of a stable coin. Right. And yeah, there's reasons in the US why we don't have them. I think it's a killer app.
00:07:54.562 - 00:07:57.762, Speaker B: Oh, it's like, wait, it puts the killer in kill app. Really benefit from this.
00:07:57.818 - 00:08:01.786, Speaker A: It puts the killer in killer app. I think you're right. For large swaths of the payment stack.
00:08:01.890 - 00:08:06.726, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I think it's entirely unfair.
00:08:06.870 - 00:08:27.278, Speaker A: Let's shift gears briefly. Let's talk about crypto markets. I said at the top of this discussion that bitcoin was mostly unchanged week over week. There was some fluctuation. We came down just slightly below 25 over the weekend, last weekend. But we've talked about this. I don't want to beat this to death, but we talk about bitcoin catalysts.
00:08:27.278 - 00:08:54.970, Speaker A: We know we have the halving April of next year. That's one of the most predictable monetary supply events on earth. Just a shill. Bitcoin's predictable monitor policy. We know that comes in April and historically has been an important event in markets. But before then, I think markets are very focused on the potential launch of an ETf, but they're still focused on it. Has anything really changed in the last week since we last talked about this?
00:08:55.042 - 00:09:00.294, Speaker B: Well, Frankel Templeton filed yesterday for a spot bitcoin ETF.
00:09:00.374 - 00:09:01.270, Speaker A: So they've joined the mix.
00:09:01.342 - 00:09:07.646, Speaker B: They've joined the mix and they also have, you know, I believe, a couple trillion under managers.
00:09:07.790 - 00:09:20.590, Speaker A: You got Blackrock, the largest asset manager in the world. You've got Invesco and Galaxy. Galaxy Invesco. Huge. Obviously. You got fidelity, which is huge. And you've got.
00:09:20.590 - 00:09:21.542, Speaker A: Who am I forgetting there's a big one?
00:09:21.558 - 00:09:24.142, Speaker B: I'm forgetting there's a 21 shares one, which is.
00:09:24.158 - 00:09:30.870, Speaker A: No, no, no, there's other big ones. So you got most of the world's top ones, asset managers. And then Franklin Templeton too, now.
00:09:30.902 - 00:09:34.614, Speaker B: So Vanguard, they come in.
00:09:34.694 - 00:09:39.046, Speaker A: I don't know. Right? I mean, yeah, I think Vanguard's number two, I think worldwide, haven't seen one from them.
00:09:39.070 - 00:09:41.774, Speaker B: But Schwab also is that one?
00:09:41.854 - 00:09:56.654, Speaker A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But the point is a flood. Now, I would think it's fair to say it's not just the more crypto native issuers, it's the traditional asset managers. It already was. But I mean, again, Franklin Templeton's like, I don't know, like four or five or something. Yeah.
00:09:56.694 - 00:10:50.628, Speaker B: No, I mean, I think essentially what you're having happen is the way I like to think about it is, again, an ETF is one of the best financial innovations that's come out in the history of financial products. The US capital market's the best capital market in the history of capital markets. And there's about to be a bitcoin spot ETF. .1.2 when you consider a product that everybody now has access to. Like how do they think about it? How do financial people think about assets? And how do people process risk, right? And essentially it comes down to the numbers, right? Is bitcoin as an asset going to help my portfolio or going to hurt it? And mathematically, the performance proves that in general it is risk reducing because it generally uncorrelated, a bit sharp ratio, and it's performance additive.
00:10:50.716 - 00:10:51.556, Speaker A: Yeah. Right.
00:10:51.620 - 00:10:58.452, Speaker B: So when you put it, put that into most portfolios, like a risk manager is gonna struggle saying no to that.
00:10:58.508 - 00:10:59.012, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:59.148 - 00:11:01.860, Speaker B: Especially if you've destigmatized the risk of holding it.
00:11:02.012 - 00:11:26.864, Speaker A: Not just stigma too. It's even some real risk. Right? Like they couldn't put it. A wealth manager can't mostly track it. Yeah, okay. Like individuals can buy spot, but like, it's not really in the platforms yet, they can't. There's a regulatory risk overall or uncertainty to it that, you know, assuming if an ETF is approved in the United States, kind of comes with a stamp of approval for the product in general.
00:11:26.864 - 00:11:43.436, Speaker A: So they feel like if they've been thinking about it for those portfolio allocation reasons, they had plenty of reasons not to go there. There was custody risk, there was regulatory uncertainty. It wasn't on their standard platform. All of which would be mitigated or alleviated from an ETF.
00:11:43.580 - 00:12:34.052, Speaker B: And then the other really important point, which BlackRock has done a really good job of highlighting, is just the liquidity, right. When you come in with an ETF product in the US, there's going to be tons of market makers on there, and it will dramatically improve the liquidity of this product. And so I think a lot of folks will become much more comfortable from the standpoint of liquidity. You can long it and short it much more easily in bigger size. You can trade it on margin, et cetera. And as we know, liquidity tends to help a product, not hurt it. And then the other thing is just the way to think about financial assets in the modern era is you've got huge pools of capital trying to win the market they're trying to win.
00:12:34.052 - 00:13:33.040, Speaker B: And so at this point, there's just going to be so much vested interest in getting this product popularized or mainstream because it's the biggest asset managers telling their clients to. If this is a good product, yeah, to look at it, consider it, consider it. And so I just think that the financial complex that is the US, which is one of the main reasons why the dollar will be dominant for a really long time, and that why people still want to live here, that's just going to help bitcoin. And so once it gets ingrained in the fabric of investing in the US, it's tough to go back. And so if now people are going to DCA in their 401 ks for the next 30 years, if it gets to that point, then in terms of how high this thing can go, I think it's pretty significant.
00:13:33.152 - 00:13:48.332, Speaker A: Yeah. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, my friend. As always, thanks for coming on. Galaxy brains. Pleasure. So we've got a little bit of a different episode than we normally do this week. As I said, we've got the entire Galaxy research team here to talk about a range of topics.
00:13:48.332 - 00:14:34.724, Speaker A: We cover a lot of stuff in this ecosystem and follow it closely, and I thought it would be really interesting if we could bring in the members of the team to talk about these topics. Some of which we're following right now are very top of mind for us. I already listed some of them, so I won't relist them. But before I get into the interviews with our analysts to talk about those topics, I wanted to talk about one that I didn't talk about with a guest that I would like to share, which is sort of what I'm focused on in the bitcoin ecosystem today. There's been a huge interest, an uptick in interest in discussing what could be the next upgrade to bitcoin. So we had the taproot upgrade, which went live I think almost two years ago. But a lot of people have been talking about various types of covenants proposals, whether that's op check template verify or opvault.
00:14:34.724 - 00:15:24.220, Speaker A: People talk about any prev out. Most of these are upgrades that would enhance the programmability of bitcoin to allow for things like covenants or ways to attach more encumbrances to bitcoin transactions that would allow significantly more programmability, in particular for custody. I'm very supportive of this concept of covenants. I've been on the record talking about my support for op check template verify, which I think is a very conservative and reasonable upgrade that doesn't add too much or like encumber the protocol with a bunch of bloat. But there's also been a huge debate of a very old concept, bips 300 and 301, which collectively we refer to as drive chains. And the idea here is that these are sort of minor. Custodied, m I n e R miner, custodied, merged mined side chains.
00:15:24.220 - 00:16:16.432, Speaker A: So it's sidechains with a more trustless peg than a typical side chain would have. I think this has been controversial for a range of reasons, like many proposals, also because of the sort of tenor and aggressiveness of its promotion, but also because it could create minor centralization. It could enhance. I should say there's plenty of issues that contribute to the centralization of bitcoin mining, but this would be one, I think, that would amplify those. So it's been a really interesting time, I think, when you combine these debates with what people are trying to do in the ordinals ecosystem, which we'll get into in one of the segments later in the show, there's, I think, a renewed vigor of enhancing bitcoin's programmability and development on bitcoin. In fact, there were two other sovereign roll ups that use ZK technology that were announced. One that is working with the Taproot Wizards team, another one called Chainway.
00:16:16.432 - 00:17:16.790, Speaker A: Again born out of a desire to sort of use bitcoin as a platform more than solely as a monetary asset. As we've talked about on this show, that conflict about whether bitcoin should be thought of primarily as a monetary asset versus is it a platform upon which to build other things has been a long running debate in bitcoin, but it is renewed, and I find that very interesting. It's something I'm following very closely. So you'll hear more from me about and from Galaxy research about developments in the development roadmap for bitcoin as we go forward. One other thing I wanted to point out that I saw too, was that Coinbase, after some investigation, has announced that they do plan to integrate bitcoin's lightning network, I guess to the exchange. Most exchanges today that offer lightning, it's typically used for retail user deposits withdrawals. So as our audience may know, the lightning network is extremely fast and inexpensive way to L2 network that allows you to move bitcoin around really quickly.
00:17:16.790 - 00:17:51.680, Speaker A: It's great for retail payments, but it can also be great for deposit and withdrawal, particularly at relatively small amounts. Although the capacity and vigor of that network is increasing, allowing bigger ones. I'm very supportive of this. I think it's interesting. I had thought about bidirectional payment channels, which is what lightning is, as perhaps really effective for inter exchange settlement or even institutional bilateral settlement. But we haven't really seen that use case take off. I think instead we've seen a lot of payments and we've seen a lot of this retail to exchange settlement happen.
00:17:51.680 - 00:18:18.974, Speaker A: I think the reason for that why institutional level of settlement haven't taken off yet is one. Lightning is not very capital efficient. You have to park bitcoin and have it sit there in channels for it to be used. And it's not really at the level yet where it can support the actual size of settlement that occurs at an institutional level. But I'm always waiting to see that. And I'm a big supporter of the Lightning network. Tons of people building incredibly interesting stuff on the lightning network.
00:18:18.974 - 00:18:44.242, Speaker A: A couple of months ago I was at Bitcoin park in Nashville for the lightning conference. Literally hundreds of developers there building on lightning. So really, really happy to see Coinbase taking a step to enhance their bitcoin offering. Very positive step for the bitcoin world, in my opinion. Plenty of other stuff. I'm not going to beleaguer the other things in the markets and regulation that I'm looking at, but let's get right into the interviews with the rest of the galaxy research team. Welcome to our friend Christine Kim from Galaxy Research.
00:18:44.242 - 00:18:45.794, Speaker A: Christine, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:18:45.874 - 00:18:47.218, Speaker C: Thanks. Thanks for having me back.
00:18:47.306 - 00:18:56.426, Speaker A: Always. And of course we're going to ask Christine about what is going on in the world of Ethereum development. What's on our, you know, we got Dankoon.
00:18:56.530 - 00:18:56.858, Speaker C: Yes.
00:18:56.906 - 00:18:58.622, Speaker A: It's like the next big upgrade.
00:18:58.778 - 00:19:00.726, Speaker C: That's the main thing that developers are working on.
00:19:00.750 - 00:19:07.590, Speaker A: We're not going to go mega deep into all the stuff that's necessarily. I don't know what are you following? And then what's most interesting to you right now?
00:19:07.742 - 00:19:45.630, Speaker C: Right now I would say it's the testing that's being done on the Cancun Deneb upgrade. Developers are really trying to formalize all of the eaps, all the Ethereum improvement proposals going into upgrade. The main code change that's going into that upgrade is called proto dank sharding, which we have a report out on if you want to learn more about 4844. But developers recently are starting to consider maybe making a very last minute inclusion to address the problem of Ethereum's growing validator set size. And that really is what I've been spending most of my time lately thinking about.
00:19:45.702 - 00:19:59.974, Speaker A: So wait, tell me the problem of when you say Ethereum is growing validator set size. So, right. Every ethereum validator is 32 ETH individually. An individual or an entity can certainly run multiple of them if they have much more than 32 ETH to stake. Right.
00:20:00.014 - 00:20:04.526, Speaker C: And usually the staking providers, they run hundreds, hundreds of validators on one node.
00:20:04.590 - 00:20:09.326, Speaker A: Yeah. So what, there's. How many validators are there today?
00:20:09.430 - 00:20:12.806, Speaker C: We are very close to hitting 800,000 in total.
00:20:12.870 - 00:20:17.230, Speaker A: And you're saying the problem of the growing number of validators, what is the problem?
00:20:17.342 - 00:20:36.210, Speaker C: The problem is that when you have a growing number of validators, the networking layer of Ethereum gets very bloated. So every single validator is an additional BLS signature to aggregate when you're making attestations of verifying the network, making sure that the network comes to finality.
00:20:36.242 - 00:20:41.978, Speaker A: So this isn't the layer one blockchain, this is the peer to peer network, the gossip among nodes, right? Yes.
00:20:42.146 - 00:21:10.618, Speaker C: The process of propagating all of your messages, which are called attestations. When you're attesting to the network aggregating all of those messages together, it's resulting in a higher number of orphan blocks and it's resulting in a higher number of missed blocks in the first two slots of an epoch. I know these are very technical terms, but it's just a way to illustrate kind of the changes to the network, the way the network's getting bogged down by the growing number of validators.
00:21:10.666 - 00:21:20.586, Speaker A: So it's not the amount of staked ETH, it's the number of unique validators that are creating, signing, sharing, reading these messages amongst them.
00:21:20.610 - 00:21:41.074, Speaker C: Exactly. And that's why one of the main long term, I wouldn't say long term, maybe medium term proposals, is to actually allow validators to accumulate their ETH. Basically not have the cap of 32 ETH as the maximum effective balance, and just have the rewards of validators be proportional to how much staked ETH they.
00:21:41.114 - 00:21:43.082, Speaker A: That's how a lot of other networks operate, right?
00:21:43.138 - 00:21:43.778, Speaker C: Yes.
00:21:43.946 - 00:21:47.010, Speaker A: But here it's like what, every single one is, exactly 32.
00:21:47.082 - 00:21:47.738, Speaker C: Every single one.
00:21:47.786 - 00:21:56.078, Speaker A: Right. So there's no proportionality. They all earn, every validator earns exactly what it would earn if it gets a block, right?
00:21:56.166 - 00:22:06.710, Speaker C: Yes. And adding, say, increasing your staked ETH from 32 to 35, that doesn't increase your rewards. The maximum amount of rewards is proportional to 32 ETH.
00:22:06.742 - 00:22:07.446, Speaker A: I see.
00:22:07.630 - 00:22:13.982, Speaker C: And so the proposal is why don't we increase that to 2048 ETH or something like a very high number, which.
00:22:13.998 - 00:22:24.990, Speaker A: Would reduce the total validated set count. Wow. When I think about that, though, that would make it a very much higher barrier to entry for normal folks to validate.
00:22:25.062 - 00:22:46.942, Speaker C: Well, actually it would make independent validators a lot more attractive to a user, because right now, if you want compounding rewards, you have to go to a liquid staking service provider. You're not able to really earn more rewards if you had 35 ETH, if you wanted to earn rewards, on, say, that extra couple of ETH, because you.
00:22:46.958 - 00:22:50.590, Speaker A: Can'T put in that extra three ETH and you can't spin it up as a new one either.
00:22:50.622 - 00:22:52.262, Speaker C: You can't, unless you pull it with other people.
00:22:52.358 - 00:22:52.814, Speaker A: I see.
00:22:52.894 - 00:23:03.614, Speaker C: And to be clear, this proposal around increasing the maximum effective balance of a validator is not even the proposal that we're thinking about going into Cancun.net dot because it's so complex.
00:23:03.654 - 00:23:05.118, Speaker A: Okay, so what is it? What is the proposal?
00:23:05.166 - 00:23:35.198, Speaker C: So the other proposal that could potentially be included, and developers are going to talk about it this week on the all core developer call, is just simply capping the churn limit of ethereum. So right now the churn limit increases by one every time the validator set grows to a specific number. So it's just constantly increasing the rate at which more validators can enter. And so the proposal is just to simply cap the term limit, prevent it from increasing any further until developers can really suss out a better solution.
00:23:35.246 - 00:23:47.582, Speaker A: Oh, I see. So actually they would alleviate or mitigate the issues now by preventing the total set from growing larger, is that right? Or just reducing the rate at which it's growing?
00:23:47.638 - 00:23:55.438, Speaker C: Reducing the rate at which it's growing. Because right now the churn limit, so it caps it at a maximum of, I think, eleven or twelve validators per epoch.
00:23:55.486 - 00:23:58.506, Speaker A: Oh, wow. What, every like few seconds, right? Or every few minutes?
00:23:58.520 - 00:24:01.246, Speaker C: Every 6.4 minutes.
00:24:01.310 - 00:24:04.014, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's a fair amount. It could grow by a lot.
00:24:04.134 - 00:24:13.038, Speaker C: Yeah. And that churn limit will continue to increase as the validator set grows. But if you just cap the churn limit at say like 15, then you know for sure that the, you can.
00:24:13.086 - 00:24:27.106, Speaker A: More easily model the growth rate and can then figure out the process. So there's a temporary mitigation alleviation of the peer to peer network issues by slowing the growth of the validator set while they debate other longer term ideas.
00:24:27.210 - 00:24:41.826, Speaker C: Exactly. And I will mention that aside from the impacts to the networking layer, there's also this rationale for limiting the growth, because Ethereum wants to do future upgrades like single slot finality to kind of improve the usability of the network and the user experience.
00:24:41.930 - 00:25:16.080, Speaker A: Oh, wow, interesting. So, no, this is the ongoing development from the switch to proof of stake, right? I mean, this is, it's not a problem or question. I shouldn't say a problem, not even a question under proof of work, right? Proof of work. You just show up with work, right? You don't have to, you're not sitting there. You don't have to attest on an ongoing basis. Right? So it doesn't matter how many ASICs or GPU's you have, you don't have to declare yourself to the network until you show up with the proof that you completed work. But a proof of stake network is a more peer to peer network layer that it has to sort of exist.
00:25:16.080 - 00:25:43.418, Speaker A: You have to be standing there ready to propose a block when you're selected, right? You can't just show up at any time and compete for a block. So these issues are, and they're fundamentally different than proof works. My point. And Ethereum is still improving on and working on how to operate that effectively, like long term. That's a lot, by the way too. That's many hundreds of thousands of validators. That's a lot more than most networks have.
00:25:43.418 - 00:25:54.256, Speaker A: Right? They all participate, I believe, whereas many of them say only the top 100 actually get to participate. So it is an interesting problem.
00:25:54.360 - 00:26:30.548, Speaker C: Yeah, a very different model. I think the proof of stake model that Ethereum has employed is more complex because it transitioned from a proof of work model as well. And so it had to finagle around with some other properties. And the fact that Ethereum's consensus model is really a combination of two strains of proof of stake, one that favors network finality and the other that favors liveness. And a lot of these complexities come from the way Ethereum developers are trying to maximize both chain security and liveness at the same time. Which other proof of stake blockchains? They just pick one or the other.
00:26:30.676 - 00:27:15.862, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting. And anything else on, like what about real quick for our audience, dancun, timing the next upgrade. It's well known that this proto dank sharding is the most well known part of that upgrade, which of course we've talked about. We have a report, but creates new specialized block space on the l, one that's focused on L2 roll up data that makes it easier, cheaper, faster, et cetera, for rollups. It's proto because it's the first version of it. That's the main one. But what does the timing look like? In the past they've said, we think maybe this next upgrade, this will be the next one after Chappella and Shanghai, which actually enabled withdraws from the proof of stake network for the first time.
00:27:15.862 - 00:27:16.142, Speaker A: Which is what?
00:27:16.158 - 00:27:16.998, Speaker C: The completion of the merge.
00:27:17.046 - 00:27:29.582, Speaker A: The completion of the merge, when was that? Like April, like March or April 12. April 12. Let's go. Christine knows it. So this would be the first upgrade since then, and it had been previously discussed as maybe happening in the fall. Like, what's your sense, you think now on timing for this upgrade?
00:27:29.638 - 00:28:23.430, Speaker C: Yeah, that fall milestone we've completely blown through slipping. Yeah, it's not probably definitely not gonna happen by the end of October. Based on the testing and the number of tests, public testnets that Ethereum developers still have to get through, they still have to launch Cancun Deneb on Goerly testnet on these public ethereum testnets. And so there are some developers that are saying it could be possible that we see the mainnet upgrade happen mid to late November. But I think that's quite an ambitious timeline. And given that it really hits up against the holidays coming up in December, and with the potential inclusion of this churn limit, setting a cap to the churn limit, I think there's a lot of factors that kind of show that this upgrade might be more likely in the early part of 2025.
00:28:23.462 - 00:28:29.990, Speaker A: I see, like a Q one type of thing. Exactly. Awesome. Well, Christine Kim from Galaxy Research, thank you for joining Galaxy Brains, as always.
00:28:30.062 - 00:28:31.274, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:28:32.494 - 00:28:36.502, Speaker A: Welcome Lucas Cheyenne from Galaxy Research to Galaxy Brains. Thanks, Lucas, for joining us.
00:28:36.558 - 00:28:37.958, Speaker D: Thank you. Glad to be back.
00:28:38.046 - 00:28:49.350, Speaker A: Yeah. So Lucas was on an episode last summer talking about Makerdao, the machinations of Makerdao at the time, it was early in what Endgame rollout proposal.
00:28:49.462 - 00:28:55.990, Speaker D: Exactly. Endgame had kind of just been released and there was a ton of infighting. And it was a really political period for mega Dow.
00:28:56.062 - 00:29:03.532, Speaker A: It was really interesting. Lucas was an intern at Galaxy Research last summer. He's now a researcher on the Galaxy research team. Yes.
00:29:03.588 - 00:29:04.516, Speaker D: Honored to be back.
00:29:04.620 - 00:29:19.716, Speaker A: Yeah, honored to have you. And let's talk. We're gonna talk about two main topics, I think, with Lucas. One, you're working on a big paper. Well, I'll tell you what they are. First, we're talking about crypto and AI and what sort of overlap we see in the market today. And then also we'll dig into Solana a little bit.
00:29:19.716 - 00:29:32.156, Speaker A: You've been following Solana for a long time. You're writing a paper about crypto and AI. I'm not gonna spoil the paper, which is not out yet, but what are you finding? What is the overlap like? Are there categories of overlap? Is there any at all?
00:29:32.220 - 00:29:34.964, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. And if you won't spoil it, I'll spoil it.
00:29:35.004 - 00:29:35.172, Speaker A: Okay.
00:29:35.188 - 00:30:03.056, Speaker D: So basically the way that I've breaking it out and the goal of the paper for me was to kind of look at what is actually happening at the intersection tangibly right now. And so the way I look at it is there's kind of like four categories I'm seeing emerge. So the first category is pretty boring. It's just like the traditional web. Two AI integrations we're seeing with the explosion of chat GPT. So using copilot to like ten x developer talent, using stuff like training, I see.
00:30:03.080 - 00:30:07.536, Speaker A: You mean like there's not a crypto integration with the AI, but like crypto developers could use it.
00:30:07.600 - 00:30:08.000, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:30:08.032 - 00:30:08.400, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah.
00:30:08.432 - 00:30:21.560, Speaker D: So, you know, if you're a new DeFi protocol and you've got governance training, a chat GPT so that it can, somebody can go in and use a chatbot to understand exactly how your government works, making it more accessible. So things like even like code review, right?
00:30:21.592 - 00:30:22.064, Speaker A: Yep.
00:30:22.184 - 00:30:34.238, Speaker D: Smart contract security and audit is a huge thing we're seeing right there. So that is like where I think the bulk of the integration, you might say, is happening right now, but it's not specific to crypto, but it definitely benefits crypto.
00:30:34.286 - 00:30:34.710, Speaker A: Sure.
00:30:34.822 - 00:31:27.948, Speaker D: And then there's these three other categories that I think are really popping up and emerging right now. And so the first one is decentralized compute networks. And so these are basically two sided marketplaces where you have people who supply GPU's which are needed for training these models and actually running inference requests. And then you have AI teams on the other side that want to buy these GPU's. And we're seeing a lot of these projects start to pop up, and we're also seeing a lot of older crypto projects that are integrating these as part of their offerings because there's this huge GPU supply constraint. And so this is, I think, an area where it's going to be very important to see how adoption goes, because there's a huge tailwind to this, which is because there's such limited GPU's in the broader world right now that should be driving people on chain to actually get past the UX obstacles and actually use these GPU's. And so Akash is an example of a protocol.
00:31:27.948 - 00:31:42.516, Speaker D: They just rolled out their GPU offering. And so we've seen, I think they have like 150 or so GPU's. About 80 of them have been leased out so far. So they're seeing good initial adoption. It's definitely gonna take a while to see if it really takes hold.
00:31:42.620 - 00:32:00.996, Speaker A: What about, like, all the people's latent GPU's? You know, I'm a gamer, but I sleep at night. Right. Like, can those get. Is there. Have you seen anything that's like a long time thing, by the way, people have used like a, you know, like SeTI, the search for extraterrestrial terrestrial intelligence. They said the screensaver, maybe they still, I think they probably still do. Where you could donate like your cpu cycles to their effort to crunch data.
00:32:00.996 - 00:32:04.188, Speaker A: Is that something where those types of GPU's can also be unlocked here?
00:32:04.236 - 00:32:08.596, Speaker D: Yes, totally. So those are definitely being rolled out. Akash, render all these different protocols.
00:32:08.620 - 00:32:09.884, Speaker A: They have something, they have that.
00:32:09.924 - 00:32:13.988, Speaker D: It's just if you're doing like cutting edge AI research and development, you want.
00:32:14.036 - 00:32:16.540, Speaker A: Like h 120 and dedicated and the best ones. Exactly.
00:32:16.612 - 00:32:27.774, Speaker D: So. And I don't think you're going to have that same gpu constraint to get those type of GPU's. If you want to go to like Amazon Web Services, Azure, Google Cloud provider, things like that.
00:32:28.154 - 00:32:30.874, Speaker A: So that two sided market, that's the second two sided market. Yup.
00:32:30.954 - 00:33:03.690, Speaker D: Then the third one is something called zero knowledge machine learning ZKML. And actually this other guy on the blockchain, the Blockcrunch podcast, put it really well to help me understand why this is important, which is AI is very resource intensive. You need a lot of data and a lot of compute. Blockchains are resource constrained. It becomes very expensive to run a model on chain. What ZKML is doing is really bridging that gap between the two. And basically it's allowing you to run compute off chain that can then be verified on chain.
00:33:03.690 - 00:33:59.770, Speaker D: Now, I think the caveat here is it's very early for these type of projects. Most of them are in proof of concept type stage, but what they're really testing is, can we bring down the costs enough that you could run a chat GBT like model off chain and then put a proof on chain that shows, hey, I ran the model that you told me to run, and I think we're probably going to see in the next year or two whether or not this is a viable path forward. There's other things emerging, like fully homomorphic encryption. You have like these secure enclaves like Intel SGX that are also competing kind of with the CKML space. But I think if this is successful, what it will unlock is huge things in smart contract functionality. So you'll be able to have DeFi protocols that have self moderating smart contracts. So if you want to rebalance a pool or something like that, you've got gaming, you can create really cool bots and things like that.
00:33:59.770 - 00:34:17.706, Speaker D: It could have some implications for identity. I think it's a little bit, it's still far off, but it would be a great unlock and would really expand the design space for the smart contract space. I think if ZKML is successful, when you talk to teams, they'll tell you it's very early and it's very expensive.
00:34:17.810 - 00:34:39.400, Speaker A: Interesting. So that's gonna be great paper from Lucas. We're gonna check that out. Let's switch into Solana here, which I've talked about is probably the only interesting community l one community right now. I mean, no offense to anyone else, but in terms of usage, right. It's still, still around. And what's the interesting stuff you're seeing in the Solana world these days?
00:34:39.512 - 00:35:16.860, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think for me, it's not so much about the products or stuff that's being rolled on Solana. For me, a lot of what drives my interest in Solana is just the space that it occupies in the broader crypto ecosystem. And so just to give some context, I originally got interested in Solana because I was doing a lot of on chain stuff, on Polygon and binance, smart chain, and Solana got released. And actually there was this Nft mint for this NFT called DJ and Ape Academy. And I just liked the art. And I was like, I should try and get this. And I went on to Solana, and immediately I was like, wow, the UX is just so much better than anywhere else.
00:35:16.860 - 00:35:55.408, Speaker D: And so to this day, I think they continue to be kind of a leader when it comes to Ux. And a big part of that is metamask is not the standard wallet. You have things like Phantom and Soulflare, which just much better, I think, in terms of ux. That's what really brought me into Solana in the first place. What's kept me interested in it is really narrative community than tech. So from the narrative and community aspect, I think because Solana is kind of going in such a different direction than the EVM people are. It's created like this almost counterculture, and you have really committed devs who believe in the vision of Solana and want to make sure they're building on Solana, only they're not just going to chase the next chain.
00:35:55.456 - 00:35:59.928, Speaker A: But there were those NFT, the D gods guys, they left Solana. Right.
00:36:00.016 - 00:36:00.432, Speaker D: I agree with that.
00:36:00.448 - 00:36:01.528, Speaker A: There were some that did leave.
00:36:01.576 - 00:36:28.028, Speaker D: And I actually put out a tweet thread saying that Solana's best value right now is like an exporter, like, we export our best projects, you know, but that said, the fact that you could build up a project on Solana to that level and then move the community over to Ethereum and remain a top project, I think, is actually a real. Shows a real value proposition of something like Solana for getting your start and for building on, because it has these really cheap fees. You can bring in a lot of people that might not have been involved if you had started on it.
00:36:28.076 - 00:36:37.564, Speaker A: Interesting. And the other thing that people had been, I think, rightly critical of Solana on was its downtime issues. What's the status on that?
00:36:37.644 - 00:37:04.342, Speaker D: Yeah, so that's kind of like the third bucket for me. So there's the ux, there's the narrative and community, and then there's the actual tech. And I say it's the third bucket. It's obviously the most important. It's because it creates that environment that where you can have that community and where you can have that ux. And I think Solana, over the past year, the Solana labs team and the developers have done an incredible job really addressing a lot of the bottlenecks that were causing this downtime. So Solana has not had an outage since February.
00:37:04.342 - 00:37:22.748, Speaker D: In the second quarter was the first time there was no outage in a very long time. And they've implemented really, like, three key updates. I don't think we need to go into them too much, but basically what Solana has done is they've made it so that when there is congestion in a part of the network, it doesn't affect other parts of the network. And that's a huge unlock.
00:37:22.796 - 00:37:25.884, Speaker A: So it's like isolated fee markets. Exactly, yeah.
00:37:26.004 - 00:37:53.516, Speaker D: Something called quic, and then there's something called stake based qos. Those, I think, are huge unlocks, great for the tech. And then looking forward, they're releasing another client called fire Dancer. That's only going to increase the throughput of the network, and it'll also be like a second client for Solana. Besides Ethereum, you don't have any other major l one s that have multiple clients. So that's really good for the resilience of the network over the long term. And so I just think there's a lot of excitement around Solana.
00:37:53.516 - 00:38:02.500, Speaker D: And I think the goal for Solana during this bear market was to be the third chain that's always brought up in conversations, and I think they've achieved that goal.
00:38:02.612 - 00:38:05.156, Speaker A: All right, Lucas Cheyenne from Galaxy Research. Thank you so much.
00:38:05.260 - 00:38:06.464, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:38:07.564 - 00:38:11.604, Speaker A: Welcome to Gabe Parker from Galaxy Research. Gabe, welcome back on the podcast.
00:38:11.724 - 00:38:12.604, Speaker E: Thank you for having me.
00:38:12.644 - 00:38:50.294, Speaker A: You've never been on the podcast since we've shot video, but Gabe was also on last summer, and now you're back and we're going to talk about bitcoin ordinals ecosystem, which, as our audience will know from our shows with Casey Rotimore and Udi Wertheimer and Dennis Porto. I'm going to simplify this dramatically, but our bitcoin nfts, it's a way to upload data, including images, and then simultaneously tether them to specific, unique satoshis. What's going on in bitcoin ordinal world? Because we put out a great report, which Gabe was a co author of back in late February. What's happened since then?
00:38:50.714 - 00:39:11.134, Speaker E: Well, since then, a lot's happened. I think there's been a lot of impressive strides on the infrastructure side. So, to put it in perspective, when we released our first report on ordinals, the total amount of inscriptions was only at 640,000. And today we're just a bit above 31 million.
00:39:11.214 - 00:39:11.686, Speaker A: Wow.
00:39:11.790 - 00:39:49.964, Speaker E: So there's been an insane amount of growth since we first talked about it during that time. I think the most obvious thing is that the infrastructure is now here on the marketplace side and on the wallet side. I think one of the biggest problems in the first months of the ordinal saga was there were no major marketplaces available and the wallet infrastructure was not there yet. Things like Utxo labeling and Sat labeling didn't exist. So there were cases where users would just accidentally spend their Utxo set with.
00:39:50.004 - 00:40:17.498, Speaker A: Call it like coin control and labeling, Utxo labeling in the wallet so you could accidentally, while conducting a different bitcoin transaction, just trying to like pay Gabe for, you know, lunch or something, send him the SAT. That includes my ordinal. Right. So I accidentally mix it with my other utxos. Only some really advanced wallets, actually advanced wallets. At the time, bitcoin wallets even had that coin control feature, but now they've sort of sorted that out. Yeah.
00:40:17.546 - 00:40:50.156, Speaker E: And the UX is really clean. I mean, I use Unisat and that's where I collect all my ordinals. And it's really easy. It's honestly the same look and feel as metamask in the coinbase wallet. So the infrastructure has improved tremendously. And I think on the marketplace side, we've had players like Magic Eden enter into the scene, OKX Binance, and right now those are the dominant players, accumulating the most volume. Magic Eden was the most impressive because at the time they supported ordinals.
00:40:50.156 - 00:41:03.856, Speaker E: They were the fifth largest marketplace out of all NFT marketplaces because they also support Solana Polygon. And they're the first native marketplace.
00:41:03.960 - 00:41:05.552, Speaker A: Right. Existing one. Right?
00:41:05.608 - 00:41:23.616, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. And I think this trend is going to continue to play out. NFTs, as we know, are in a bear market. The meta is dead. NFTs are kind of just irrelevant right now. So even in this state, it's impressive to see players like magic Eden give it a try.
00:41:23.720 - 00:41:24.008, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:24.056 - 00:41:30.384, Speaker E: You know, and I think down the road we could definitely see like an open sea on board ordinals.
00:41:30.464 - 00:41:31.084, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:32.104 - 00:41:34.752, Speaker E: And I think that would be major.
00:41:34.888 - 00:41:54.658, Speaker A: Are we seeing like interest from the broader NFT community migrate at all to ordinals? Or is it the sprouting of a new community primarily? Like, how do you, how do you view that as it more, is it bitcoiners? Is it people that weren't really into one or bitcoin? And so it's like a third way, or is it coming from the. To what extent in your mind?
00:41:54.746 - 00:42:38.772, Speaker E: I think it's a mix of both, but predominantly from the communities I'm in and especially at bitcoin Miami, just talking to people who are in the ordinal space, it seems to me that bitcoiners who never really got a chance to experiment with NFTs on Ethereum now have the opportunity to have that same feel and embrace the NFT culture on their own. Chain on. That's the first time some of these people have collected just digital collectibles on chain at all. So I think it's a lot of bitcoiners and just curious d gen traders who trade just NFTs just for pure profit.
00:42:38.868 - 00:42:55.080, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. What about the issuers though, like who has come over to. We know there's a bunch of interesting, we've talked to several members. Right, of the Taproot Wizards team, but who from the broader NFT ecosystem has issued on ordinals?
00:42:55.192 - 00:43:02.120, Speaker E: Well, the biggest player is Yugalabs, as you know, they released twelve fold, which was a generative art collection on shake.
00:43:02.232 - 00:43:07.384, Speaker A: And now there's like a new, like a scavenger hunt they're doing with it or something.
00:43:07.424 - 00:43:09.096, Speaker E: Yeah, they're doing these like puzzles.
00:43:09.240 - 00:43:12.096, Speaker A: And you have to upload the solution as an ordinal. Yeah.
00:43:12.160 - 00:43:18.656, Speaker E: You inscribe your answer and if you're right, you get like 0.125 bitcoin or something like that.
00:43:18.680 - 00:43:20.080, Speaker A: Wow, that's significant. That's fun.
00:43:20.192 - 00:43:27.656, Speaker E: But that was interesting because first of all, Yuga Labs has never released the generative art collection at all.
00:43:27.760 - 00:43:28.352, Speaker D: At all.
00:43:28.448 - 00:43:48.320, Speaker E: And they decided to venture into that on bitcoin. And I think that shows that ordinals are here to stay. You know, it's obvious it works, right. You know, they were able to release an impressive collection with no hurdles, no issues.
00:43:48.392 - 00:43:48.720, Speaker A: Really?
00:43:48.792 - 00:43:55.952, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, it was a clean mint. It was an interesting mint. It was a bidding war, basically. If you were, like, in the top, was it 200, 250?
00:43:56.008 - 00:43:59.480, Speaker A: Yeah. I forget how many they had. It was not that many. Two or 300. There's somewhere in there.
00:43:59.512 - 00:44:01.720, Speaker E: It's a very limited collection. I think that's.
00:44:01.832 - 00:44:12.766, Speaker A: You had to blindly bid, and only if you ended up in the top, whatever, that would you win. And then everyone else saw their bitcoin sent back to them, basically. But that was interesting. Yeah. So there.
00:44:12.830 - 00:44:54.074, Speaker E: I think that's the most significant collection in my eyes right now. Although, you know, the floor has gone down. I think just last week, a twelve fold ordinal sold for like 70 or 60% below where they minted. But we're seeing that across all nfTs, just like floor price prices plummeting. So I think that will definitely rebound as we enter into the next cycle. And that's the biggest thing is right now, everything's down bad in the digital collective space. So I'm not surprised that these collections on bitcoin are trading down.
00:44:54.074 - 00:45:02.890, Speaker E: But the more important thing is that there's still volume and people are excited.
00:45:02.962 - 00:45:21.494, Speaker A: And there's infrastructure development, which is, I think, different. Most of the rest of the NFT world has already been built out, but there's a lot of people building. What are you looking for over the next six months to be interesting in ordinal space? Is it upgrades to ordinals to the protocol? I know there have been several. Is it.
00:45:22.354 - 00:45:39.158, Speaker E: So something we're looking at is recursions, which is basically attaching one inscription to multiple other inscriptions to combine to create a more complex ordinal.
00:45:39.246 - 00:45:39.446, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:39.470 - 00:46:28.994, Speaker E: Like, one ordinal could be the culmination of six inscriptions, or even more. So we kind of think of recursions as a compression mechanism, which has been a new thing in the broader NFT space. Just like scaling ordinals or scaling just nfts. This is kind of where this came from. So we're looking at recursions, re inscriptions as well, and then these are very. These, we can call it just new upgrades to the protocol that are still being experimented, but it's the best time to experiment in a bear market, you know? So once, I think other collections see how people are using recursions and reinscriptions, we're going to see more dynamic collection down the road.
00:46:29.074 - 00:46:33.610, Speaker A: Cool. Gabe Parker from Galaxy Research. Thanks for coming on galaxy brains, my friend.
00:46:33.682 - 00:46:34.494, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:46:35.634 - 00:46:40.266, Speaker A: Let's go now to Charles Yu from Galaxy Research, our friend. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains, Chuck.
00:46:40.330 - 00:46:41.322, Speaker F: Yeah, GM.
00:46:41.418 - 00:47:10.436, Speaker A: Gm. So you've been following, among many things, the L2 wars, I'm going to call them. I don't know, l two season. I mean, as far back as almost. Right after you joined Galaxy, you wrote a great paper called l two in search of scaling a guide to L2, which is on our website. It's a great report that really takes a very high level overview of the layered scaling approach ecosystem at that time. You've since followed it up multiple times, but most recently on the glass half full series.
00:47:10.436 - 00:47:24.952, Speaker A: Looking at optimism and arbitrum, optimistic roll ups. Got a new thing coming out on those very soon. People have called it on chain summer. Right. L two season is what I've called it. What is the state of L2s today in your mind?
00:47:25.128 - 00:47:32.584, Speaker F: I mean, I'll be honest. We called it l two season back in 2021 and again in 2022. It's always l two season.
00:47:32.704 - 00:47:33.120, Speaker G: Yeah.
00:47:33.192 - 00:47:44.328, Speaker F: Honestly. But now it actually feels like roll ups are gaining much more traction and adoption. They're getting major sign on from major corporations. Yeah.
00:47:44.416 - 00:47:48.128, Speaker A: Like applications are deploying there at scale now, right? Yeah.
00:47:48.216 - 00:48:02.264, Speaker F: Even different projects across, like different blockchains. Like we're seeing some parachains launch with ZK rollups or all l one s. Like Celo Phantom even proposing to come back as rollups.
00:48:02.344 - 00:48:21.334, Speaker A: I saw that some all l one s that now will sort of rejoin the ethereum fold as an l two. What is just broadly for the audience who may not have thought about this or know, what is broadly the reason why layered scaling? Why l two s? Like, why? What is the thesis here generally for why they need to exist?
00:48:21.794 - 00:48:36.658, Speaker F: I mean, I think it's really just that Ethereum is the big liquidity hub. It's got the most integrations with different, you know, on ramp providers. It's got one of the most robust, like developer ecosystems. And really it's just where all the capital is.
00:48:36.706 - 00:48:38.494, Speaker A: But why not build right on the l one?
00:48:38.954 - 00:48:53.334, Speaker F: Well, cause it's too hard, too costly, too expensive. You're dealing with massive gas costs and it really just prevents a bunch of applications from really taking off.
00:48:54.114 - 00:49:34.254, Speaker A: So you think the l two season, season three, does that impact the l one thesis? I mean, I feel like those fees and gas costs and whatnot and slowness and whatever on Ethereum in 21 played a huge role in the Alt L1 growth we saw from chains like Solana and Soluna Avax was like the joke, right? And they sort of like went, you needed faster, cheaper block space at that time because of congestion. Is that if we have a budding ecosystem, viable ecosystem of L2s, does that, how does that impact the l one thesis in your mind?
00:49:35.154 - 00:50:20.190, Speaker F: Yeah, well, I mean, the whole idea behind like the all l one thesis was basically just shortcuts to achieving scale. I mean, you know this with some of the growth hacks that have been proposed for bitcoin, for ethereum, just faster, cheaper, bigger blocks, right, to enable cheaper costs. And really, I think people have come to understand the difficulties in actually attracting more liquidity to their chain from the Ethereum ecosystem. It's much easier to just build on top of it to have that liquidity more integrated, more available and. Yeah, really just lessons to load for developing teams.
00:50:20.262 - 00:50:46.684, Speaker A: What do you think on the ZK side? Because you've done a lot of work and published a lot on the optimistic roll up side, these are sort of the two main flavors in the Ethereum world, and optimistic rollups are out there. You've got optimism and arbitrum, and now base Coinbase is optimistic roll up. But the ZK stuff is still mostly under development. What is the state of the ZK situation actually at the moment?
00:50:47.064 - 00:50:58.142, Speaker F: So far we've seen Polygon ZkVM, ZK sync era launch as the, the first two ZK EVMs. This was back in March, I believe, towards the end of March.
00:50:58.198 - 00:51:01.302, Speaker A: So they've been running, they've been running. Are people using them at scale?
00:51:01.478 - 00:51:18.558, Speaker F: They're showing a lot of transactions, a lot of activity. But to be fair, I think most of the activity is related to airdrop farming layer zero stargate. These projects that have really attracted a lot of bots and farming activity.
00:51:18.646 - 00:51:27.598, Speaker A: Interesting. So they're not in your mind yet challenging organic use of optimistic roll ups?
00:51:27.726 - 00:51:36.878, Speaker F: As far as what I've seen so far, I haven't seen anything new really brought to the table from these ZK roll ups, or at least nothing on the ZK VM side.
00:51:37.006 - 00:51:38.534, Speaker A: Adoption side.
00:51:38.614 - 00:51:43.954, Speaker F: Yeah, all the defi activity still pretty much feels the same, if not more limited.
00:51:44.454 - 00:52:15.814, Speaker A: But this is thought by many as ultimately the holy grail of layered scaling is zero knowledge based something. So we're just not there yet. They're not there yet. How do you envision that playing out? Let's say they get technically competitive with other types of roll ups. Then do people start migrating from optimistic ones to them if they're better? Or what does that competitive dynamic look like when you take out your crystal ball.
00:52:16.394 - 00:52:41.494, Speaker F: Yeah. Well, right now it's really just. I think they have to get over all the forward promising that's typically done by crypto projects across the space. Look at the actual usability of the product today. There's obviously a lot of hype around ZK technology. It's been around forever. But like I said, I've been hearing ZK rollups are the premier scaling solution.
00:52:42.474 - 00:52:43.602, Speaker A: For a long time.
00:52:43.738 - 00:52:57.384, Speaker F: For a long time. And I just haven't really seen anything really come to fruition to really challenge that idea. Especially while the optimistic roll ups are still taking off and finding massive new waves of adoption.
00:52:57.464 - 00:53:03.712, Speaker A: And they are finding new waves of adoption. What's driving that? Which types of apps are we seeing on these roll ups, et cetera?
00:53:03.848 - 00:53:21.756, Speaker F: Yeah, I think Coinbase's base chain is a good example here. Some of the applications that we've seen, like Friendtech, have really brought new social fi activities into fruition.
00:53:21.820 - 00:53:29.596, Speaker A: That's pretty net new, right. It's not just like launching, relaunching an AmM or relaunching a lending protocol on there, but it's like there isn't a.
00:53:29.620 - 00:53:33.420, Speaker F: Friendech elsewhere, at least not a successful one.
00:53:33.492 - 00:53:47.824, Speaker A: Yeah. In fact, we saw that for a couple days recently, the total trading volume on Friendtech exceeded the volume of all NFT trades on marketplaces. Pretty wild stat.
00:53:48.144 - 00:53:49.764, Speaker F: I mean, and that's all.
00:53:50.664 - 00:53:52.600, Speaker A: That's just one application, I guess.
00:53:52.752 - 00:54:02.404, Speaker F: I think that's just growth marketing hacks for you. I won't say like leaking airdrop rumors, but anytime.
00:54:02.864 - 00:54:10.664, Speaker A: Well, there is literally a section in the app that says Airdrop and shows your accumulated points and they're not like, it's not clear what points will mean.
00:54:10.784 - 00:54:13.968, Speaker F: Yeah, that was something that was new that was added in like this past week, right?
00:54:14.016 - 00:54:26.848, Speaker A: No, no, it's been there for a couple. I don't know. I'm not really on there much, so I'm not sure. But it's literally there. And I think you get them from types of activity that you perform and maybe also for the number of invite of your invite codes that get used. I'm not sure.
00:54:27.016 - 00:54:29.408, Speaker F: Right. I think there was a new measure that was introduced.
00:54:29.496 - 00:54:30.864, Speaker A: I think they may have altered it.
00:54:30.944 - 00:54:35.360, Speaker F: Or something, which really just drove the new rebound in activity.
00:54:35.432 - 00:54:47.104, Speaker A: So in a future where blockchain based systems are widely adopted across swaths of society, are most people on an l two?
00:54:48.724 - 00:55:11.116, Speaker F: I believe so, yeah. I don't think it's necessarily up to the power of the team building DL two if they're doing that in isolation, it's going to become much more difficult to compete with chains like Coinbase, where they have touch points at every single client interaction, wallets on ramps.
00:55:11.220 - 00:55:16.264, Speaker A: So it's a business development and adoption type of game, you think?
00:55:16.364 - 00:55:18.624, Speaker F: I mean, people are lazy, people want.
00:55:18.704 - 00:55:32.204, Speaker A: Easy integrations, and it seems like there's. What if I infer from your point, then it almost becomes commoditized. The l two block space. You're not so much competing on the technical merit of the thing, but instead how connected it is.
00:55:32.624 - 00:55:35.344, Speaker F: I wish that weren't the case, but, yeah, it seems like.
00:55:35.464 - 00:55:42.316, Speaker A: Well, it's interesting. All right, well, Charles, you from Galaxy Research. Chuck, my friend, thank you for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:55:42.400 - 00:55:43.504, Speaker F: Thank you for having me.
00:55:44.284 - 00:55:48.180, Speaker A: Welcome Zach Bacorni from Galaxy Research. Zach, thanks so much for coming on. Galaxy brains.
00:55:48.252 - 00:55:49.644, Speaker G: Yeah, pleasure to be here, Alex. Thank you.
00:55:49.684 - 00:55:57.100, Speaker A: So this is Zach's first time on galaxy brains because he's new to our team as of this past summer. So welcome. Welcome to Galaxy.
00:55:57.212 - 00:56:00.612, Speaker G: Yeah, appreciate it. It's been an awesome two months. Got a great team here, and we.
00:56:00.628 - 00:56:01.868, Speaker A: Got a lot of interesting stuff.
00:56:01.956 - 00:56:02.676, Speaker G: Yeah, heads down.
00:56:02.740 - 00:56:16.806, Speaker A: So I wanted to ask Zach, one of your primary interests, and certainly not only, but interest in crypto, is the emergence of more real world assets on chain. What is that? First of all, when I say real world assets on chain, what am I even talking about?
00:56:16.910 - 00:56:31.942, Speaker G: Yeah, so essentially we're just bringing, or issuers are just bringing traditionally off chain assets like treasury bonds, private credit related debt, and issuing tokens around them on the blockchain. So you're bringing those opportunities.
00:56:31.998 - 00:56:36.754, Speaker A: So is this tokenization? Has tokenization finally found a product market fit here?
00:56:37.914 - 00:56:46.522, Speaker G: I don't know if we could necessarily say that, because it is just demanded from people who are natively on chain.
00:56:46.698 - 00:56:52.906, Speaker A: Haven't there always been, I mean, like, stablecoins, is that a real world asset in your mind? They're dollars, are they not?
00:56:53.050 - 00:56:56.490, Speaker G: Yeah, technically, stablecoins are real world assets.
00:56:56.682 - 00:57:00.962, Speaker A: If you produce a chart of real world asset growth, would you include stablecoins or.
00:57:00.978 - 00:57:24.084, Speaker G: No, actually, that's a great question because in the report that we're putting together now, excluded them kind of from the whole deal just because the force is kind of working against them in terms of, like, interest rates off chain rising, disincentivizing people from holding stable points on chain and just their relative size. Right. They're so big, so it kind of obfuscates what's going on with the treasuries.
00:57:24.384 - 00:57:29.760, Speaker A: I see. It's sort of a category error in terms of understanding the actual thing you want to talk about.
00:57:29.832 - 00:57:30.272, Speaker G: Exactly.
00:57:30.328 - 00:57:44.392, Speaker A: So when you talk about treasuries, what's the point of bringing treasuries on chain? Like, why, why all in the yield? So there's what? There's. So. Right. We have a high interest rate environment. People are getting yield in tradfi through bonds.
00:57:44.488 - 00:57:50.600, Speaker G: Yeah. In excess of what you would otherwise be getting on chain through, like an accessible channel, like depositing USDT.
00:57:50.672 - 00:58:12.474, Speaker A: Right. But that's a flip from like, the prior bull market when. Yeah, when interest rates were zero in the traditional world, or near zero, but people were getting yield on chain that was much higher, which probably drove a lot of the growth in TVL there. I will say a lot of that yield was like implied yield. It was like incentivized yield. So you would receive like some token. You'd be farming.
00:58:12.474 - 00:58:26.098, Speaker A: Yeah. The calculation of the yield was like, were you to farm and then sell the token. But that's flipped. Right. So is that driving, that's now driving a demand on chain for yield that's pulling in these traditional assets.
00:58:26.226 - 00:58:43.130, Speaker G: Yeah, exactly. So you're even seeing it in like, the liquidity of like, stablecoin pools on Aave and other lending protocols. They're down in the billions while we're looking at an increase in money market funds and US treasuries on chain going up to a similar magnitude.
00:58:43.202 - 00:58:50.874, Speaker A: So where are they going? Like, these treasury bills and other real world, like, where on chain is this happening? This activity happening?
00:58:50.994 - 00:58:54.074, Speaker G: Yeah, it's primarily happening on Ethereum, some.
00:58:54.114 - 00:59:10.718, Speaker A: Interest in Polygon, Zkevm, but in which types of applications? Like, is it, is it like lending protocols? Like who, how is like a traditional issuer putting them on chain? Like where am I going to buy them or whatever. Like what?
00:59:10.806 - 00:59:15.446, Speaker G: Yeah, so in a lot of instances, you're just going straight through their portal, like very similar to how you would.
00:59:15.470 - 00:59:18.598, Speaker A: Have like a traditional, really like the issuer themselves.
00:59:18.766 - 00:59:32.150, Speaker G: Yeah. So they have like signup pages and KyC AML procedures that you have to go through. In some instances, you can buy them on dexs, but again, there are limitations in terms of whitelisted addresses that can.
00:59:32.182 - 01:00:03.634, Speaker A: Hold these regulatory issues. But Maker has had some RWA, and I apologize to my traditional friends for calling it that. Some real world assets in their PSM, even they have a Huntington Valley bank. And I can't remember, was it Santander or another. There was some traditional debt there. And there are some protocols that are designed to help people, help DeFi applications integrate these types of things, right?
01:00:03.794 - 01:00:31.006, Speaker G: Yeah. Yeah. So you are seeing a fair amount of that. And they're kind of piggybacking off of tethers playbook, almost, where they're kind of cashing in on the off chain revenue that they could be earning and kind of translating it and kind of democratizing it in a way that kind of allows the value accumulated by these rwas to roll up to individuals, as opposed to it just being gated by some centralized issuer like it is in most cases.
01:00:31.070 - 01:01:14.374, Speaker A: It's definitely tricky from a regulatory standpoint, in the US in particular. And that will save that discussion, I think, for another day because it's a big, deep discussion about DeFi in the US, 100%. But do you think, is this. If we talk about the ebb and flow, the switch when Defi yields were higher than tradfi yields in 2021, you saw a big inflow into Defi. When they were lower than tradfi yields, you seen a big outflow from Defi. Now people are trying to bring the tradfi yields back on chain. If the yields come back down in tradfi, will we see the capital flow back out? Right now we have this binary system where capital is flowing between them in search of yield.
01:01:14.374 - 01:01:25.684, Speaker A: Do you think that continues forever? Or is there some equilibrium? I guess maybe if we get fully regulated, approved DeFi, then they become the same one system instead. What does that look like in your mind?
01:01:25.764 - 01:01:56.944, Speaker G: Yeah, exactly. So, in the long run, I definitely see the yields converging on each other. What you would achieve off chain will be what you achieve on chain. But for now, you kind of have these two systems, and it's almost like a dollar is not worth a dollar. A stable coin is less productive than a dollar in the real world. And that's what I've been trying to wrap my head around, is how sustainable or how sticky are these real world assets that are coming on? Chain history is kind of being written today. We can't look back in the past and be like, oh, this happened in 2017.
01:01:57.064 - 01:01:58.296, Speaker A: Here's an analog to look at.
01:01:58.320 - 01:02:31.906, Speaker G: Yeah, exactly. But what I found, kind of looking within RWAs, is that they are very sensitive to interest rates. Like you look at private credit, it maxed out at 1.41.5 billion right as the Fed started hiking rates, and it came way down almost by 75% as rates started to rise. So, history is being written, so we can't know for sure. But kind of looking within real world assets themselves, we are seeing that they are sensitive to interest rates. And that their longevity may only last so long as the higher for longer.
01:02:31.906 - 01:02:34.314, Speaker G: Narrative sticks and they follow through with that.
01:02:34.354 - 01:02:42.774, Speaker A: That's very interesting. So wait, when you say private credit, are you talking about some of those ones I mentioned, like Huntington Valley bank stuff on maker, what was on chain that. That reduced 75%?
01:02:42.894 - 01:02:50.022, Speaker G: Yeah. So there are protocols that essentially raise money on chain to loan out to companies off chain.
01:02:50.078 - 01:02:50.534, Speaker A: I see.
01:02:50.614 - 01:03:07.522, Speaker G: So, yeah, companies that wouldn't otherwise, or startups that wouldn't otherwise be able to get funding through traditional channels can raise money through these on chain channels. On chain, people benefit from the higher yield. The off chain startup company, whatever it might be, benefits from new funding.
01:03:07.678 - 01:03:08.058, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:08.106 - 01:03:21.378, Speaker G: And it's kind of interesting to see geographically where this capital is kind of flowing in terms of where these lenders are distributing it to. You're seeing in Africa, Latin, and South America. And. Yeah, really cool stuff.
01:03:21.506 - 01:03:54.516, Speaker A: And that was big when there was no yields in tradfi, in the low interest rate environment. So, like, in the high interest rate environment, that activity on chain, that activity on chain has slowed. It's being replaced by bring the yield bearing assets on chain for the Defi user. Right. Because my sense of it is that there's no competition between Defi and tradfi. No one's like, you know what? I was going to do this at my brokerage firm, but instead I'll do it in Defi. It's really servicing the demand from the existing DeFi users per yield.
01:03:54.516 - 01:04:15.592, Speaker A: Right. And to me, that's a barrier for long term defi adoption. It's got to be good enough, regulated, safe enough, whatever, to actually compete with tradfi infrastructure, rather than just, we do have a large community of people that hold crypto assets that they can't use in tradfi. So they say, you know what? Bring the tradfi to me, basically.
01:04:15.728 - 01:04:16.112, Speaker G: Yeah.
01:04:16.168 - 01:04:17.112, Speaker A: That's the state of it today.
01:04:17.168 - 01:04:18.352, Speaker G: Right, exactly.
01:04:18.488 - 01:04:18.736, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:18.760 - 01:04:28.964, Speaker G: I don't think we're converting any new users through rwas. I think these issuers, traditional on chain native or crypto native, they're just servicing.
01:04:29.004 - 01:04:30.384, Speaker F: People who are already here.
01:04:31.004 - 01:04:31.948, Speaker A: They see demand.
01:04:32.076 - 01:04:37.476, Speaker G: Yeah, exactly. They're just kind of filling the hole for demand that exists among the on chain cohort.
01:04:37.540 - 01:04:46.436, Speaker A: Well, I'm really excited to read Zach's report. It's going to come out in the next few weeks, I think. And you have a lot of data on this to help tell this story. But it is growing, right? It's growing. RWA is on chain.
01:04:46.460 - 01:04:51.996, Speaker G: Yeah, yeah. Undeniably, it is growing. And as long as the right environment kind of stays intact.
01:04:52.060 - 01:04:52.788, Speaker A: Do you think it will?
01:04:52.876 - 01:04:55.004, Speaker G: It will, yeah. I imagine it will continue.
