00:00:07.160 - 00:00:11.702, Speaker A: Welcome my friend Bimnett Abibi from Galaxy Digital Trading. As always, how are you doing? Good.
00:00:11.758 - 00:00:12.382, Speaker B: How are you doing?
00:00:12.438 - 00:00:31.256, Speaker A: I'm good. It's good to see you. It's a little bit of a quiet week, I guess, after last week, certainly in crypto, which was a material uplift and prices. Now we're sort of sideways at these levels. Viewers of our YouTube channel, which we are on video, if you only listen on audio, worth checking us out on video occasion.
00:00:31.280 - 00:00:33.924, Speaker B: I've always thought I've had a face for podcasts.
00:00:34.944 - 00:00:44.844, Speaker A: Viewers will see the block clock next to me, which shows that we're at about 22 six on bitcoin. So we're still up where we were, but a little quiet. Anything you're paying attention to in particular this week?
00:00:46.184 - 00:01:22.134, Speaker B: Yeah, a couple of things with respect to crypto. One of the things is CME activity. So we've seen a pretty material jump in open interest on CME, bitcoin, and I think ETH futures as well. And I think that's a sign of growing sort of institutional adoption. In addition, it's a sign that folks are still not comfortable with credit risk in the space. People want to buy bitcoin without facing counterparty risk or without having counterparty risk. And obviously the CME is a gold standard.
00:01:22.134 - 00:02:08.378, Speaker B: I think the growing importance of CME futures tells you that this asset class has a place in institutional portfolios. In addition, the guys that have been buying the stuff on CME, they've been paying a premium to spot. That shows demand, shows pretty strong demand. So I think that's been super notable. Interesting. I also have been paying attention to gold in traditional markets. It's basically at trend highs, trading around 1935, and I think that's partially a function of strong seasonals and weak dollar, et cetera.
00:02:08.378 - 00:02:34.504, Speaker B: But if we're to view bitcoin as something that's similar to digital gold, I think that kind of price action and physical gold bodes very well for bitcoin. And I think if you get a break above 2000 on gold, there's going to be a lot of folks that are going to be like, oh, should I miss this? Or is this a big breakout?
00:02:34.584 - 00:02:35.448, Speaker A: Should I be buying gold?
00:02:35.496 - 00:02:48.200, Speaker B: Should I be buying gold? And then the natural question like, do I buy gold or do I buy digital gold? And so I definitely think that's a powerful narrative that a lot of folks aren't necessarily paying attention to.
00:02:48.272 - 00:02:50.360, Speaker A: Yeah, you love that bitcoin gold chart, the cross.
00:02:50.392 - 00:03:13.232, Speaker B: I love that chart. Yeah. I mean, if you look at it bottomed kind of where you'd expect it to. It's now trading at around a ratio of like eleven and it's got plenty of room to go higher. And so personally, I love being short gold versus long bitcoin. I think that gives you a really nice risk profile. It looks really good on the chart.
00:03:13.232 - 00:03:14.888, Speaker B: It's got a good story to it.
00:03:14.936 - 00:03:18.096, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. It's an interesting long term bitcoin narrative as well.
00:03:18.200 - 00:04:09.638, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. And then in terms of other things we're paying attention to, I think more than ever it's really important to be honest about the data that's coming in from the market. The market's kind of gotten ahead of itself with respect to inflation expectations that have come down a lot, bond yields that have moved a lot lower, et cetera. And so I'm very focused on data points that suggest that we're going back the other way in terms of inflation or activity. So there have been a couple of surprises to the upside recently. Not that the market is paying attention, but like the NIHB home builder survey came out a little stronger than expected. We had us services and us manufacturing pmis come in stronger than expected.
00:04:09.638 - 00:04:18.230, Speaker B: Yesterday you also had a drop in initial jobless claims. So there's like, you know, in the past week or so, you've had pretty strong.
00:04:18.342 - 00:04:21.554, Speaker A: These are like potentially inflationary, potentially inflationary.
00:04:22.654 - 00:04:49.968, Speaker B: Higher for longer suggestive things. And I think fundamentally, I'm looking at bonds and I'm like, these things are not pricing in inflation risk. It's almost like you took away that inflation risk. And guys, we have one of the tightest labor markets in history. Stocks are fine, consumer sentiment is fine. People are getting raises like crazy. I mean, Walmart raises, fucking Social Security, sorry, Social Security raises.
00:04:49.968 - 00:05:29.584, Speaker B: That went effect at the start of the year. 16 million people that get those cost of living adjustments, and you have China reopening. It's not, Europe isn't going to go through one of the worst winters or recessions in history. Things are starting to look good there and God forbid the commodities start ripping again. I think the market is totally underappreciating inflation risks. I think that's a function of, or a huge part of it is just how much cash was created over the past handful of years. It's like, okay, bond yields are really depressed cause we printed $5 trillion of money.
00:05:29.584 - 00:05:51.780, Speaker B: And so maybe they're not reflecting the true risks because it needs to find a home, et cetera. So there's a lot of neat, interesting things going on. And that's kind of what I'm paying attention to on the macro side, on the micro, like more crypto focused side of things. I mean, you've just had such insane moves and a handful of these alts.
00:05:51.812 - 00:05:52.948, Speaker A: I know, I know.
00:05:53.116 - 00:05:57.948, Speaker B: One in particular that makes no sense to me is Apdos right now.
00:05:57.996 - 00:05:58.980, Speaker A: Is that even a thing yet?
00:05:59.052 - 00:06:00.100, Speaker B: Nope, not a thing.
00:06:00.172 - 00:06:01.612, Speaker A: It doesn't. Has it launched?
00:06:01.668 - 00:06:12.892, Speaker B: I mean, I mean, maybe, maybe not. Honestly, I don't know ANYbOdY that's an actual user of aptos. I don't know what wallet like YoU would need. I think there's only a handful of developers that code in there.
00:06:12.908 - 00:06:15.780, Speaker A: And whatever coins are in the market right now, it's got to be extremely illiquid.
00:06:15.812 - 00:06:38.324, Speaker B: If there are any. Float is very limited, but right now, fully diluted. The thing's worth $17 billion, which is just crazy. And I can't tell you a single person that uses it. It doesn't have a stable coin. There's not that many developers on it. My question is, has this market not learned its lesson? What is going on? That we have a token that's appreciated? There's got to be a reversion, SHould revert.
00:06:38.324 - 00:06:51.080, Speaker B: But Milton Friedman has a great saying. The market can stay solvent longer than. Sorry. The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. That's really what constantly comes to mind.
00:06:51.112 - 00:06:53.592, Speaker A: In crypto, irrational markets. I love that.
00:06:53.648 - 00:06:54.336, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:54.400 - 00:07:01.320, Speaker A: Hey, so the Fed comes out next week with their FOMC meeting. Happens next week, I should say. Correct.
00:07:01.392 - 00:07:02.296, Speaker B: With their rate decision.
00:07:02.400 - 00:07:16.404, Speaker A: Yeah. Along with what you were saying about the market kind of underappreciating the inflation risk. Right. I mean, the market's also currently pricing less than 5% terminal rate here, right?
00:07:16.444 - 00:07:27.812, Speaker B: Yeah. Around 493 basis points. Terminal rates. You have around 25 basis points priced for this meeting and a little less than 25 priced for the next.
00:07:27.868 - 00:07:30.044, Speaker A: And what we did 50 last meeting.
00:07:30.084 - 00:07:30.532, Speaker B: Last meeting.
00:07:30.588 - 00:07:35.796, Speaker A: So the market is expecting a further decline of the hike magnitude.
00:07:35.860 - 00:07:36.984, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:07:37.404 - 00:07:49.518, Speaker A: If you had to guess, is that going to happen? Don't you think part of what Powell and the Fed governors want is to really tamp this thing down? I've heard some recently hawkish statements from some Fed members. Right.
00:07:49.566 - 00:07:52.750, Speaker B: I mean, all the Fed speak is. Yeah. So, like, yeah.
00:07:52.862 - 00:08:12.928, Speaker A: Would an upside surprise here help them with their narrative to get the market, like, in line here to make sure? Because as you've said multiple times, the worst case scenario is that they slow the magnitude and, and, you know, sort of become a little bit more dovish and then inflation rears its head again, and they have to, like, go right back. Yeah, that's what happened in the seventies a bunch.
00:08:13.016 - 00:09:06.912, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I think the Fed this year, or over the past year, has been very intelligent about how they've used the meeting to push markets. And so typically when you want the greatest bang for your buck, you surprise the market, like doing a lot and surprising the market gets you a better impact than communicating it and doing it gradually. The Fed was very effective this year, over the past year of over delivering and being more hawkish. Now, at this point, though, you've had three consecutive inflation prints that have come down. Clearly. It looks like you've topped out and some of the manufacturing surveys have really moved a lot lower.
00:09:06.912 - 00:09:22.646, Speaker B: So the data backdrop is one that allows the Fed to just kind of do the 25 and communicate, probably another 25 down the line and with potential for more. And that will kind of leave things as is.
00:09:22.710 - 00:09:22.934, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:22.974 - 00:09:36.374, Speaker B: You're meeting expectations. And so the point is, I don't think there's really that much of an incentive for them to surprise and shock the market, given that the data profile has softened.
00:09:36.494 - 00:09:39.430, Speaker A: So really they're starting to see the data they would want to see.
00:09:39.542 - 00:10:16.454, Speaker B: They are. They are. They've gotten a lot smarter in the sense that why they missed it was because they weren't, why they missed inflation really taking off was because they weren't using some of the anecdotal data or some of the soft data as heavily or the high frequency things as heavily. And now they've come out with a new rent index that they're using. They'll look at more active data series and they'll rely more on soft data and anecdotal data. And so they're a lot more progressive. And they see the writing on the wall, which is rents are starting to cool.
00:10:16.834 - 00:10:17.242, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:17.298 - 00:10:31.018, Speaker B: Like you've used auto prices have come down, home prices have come down. Like, there's a lot of things that suggest that prices are cooling. And so there's really not a need for them to surprise, I think.
00:10:31.106 - 00:10:35.774, Speaker A: Interesting. All right. Our friend bimetabibi from galaxy trading. Great to see you, as always, my friend. Friend.
