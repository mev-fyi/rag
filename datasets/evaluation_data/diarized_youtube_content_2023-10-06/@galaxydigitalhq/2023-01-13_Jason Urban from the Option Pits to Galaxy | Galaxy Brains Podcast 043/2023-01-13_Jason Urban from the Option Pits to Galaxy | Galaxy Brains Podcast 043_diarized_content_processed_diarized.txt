00:00:03.840 - 00:00:34.526, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. I'm back to attack with another funky verse. I'm on track, on pace and I'm not uncertain we're talking today with the legend Jason Urban, 23. We get to be front row to Destiny. These blow ups, that's the best you got to send to me? The bits and blocks keep going tick and talking, yo. I'll be talking shop till that final ball drops, yo. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmware research at Galaxy Digital.
00:00:34.526 - 00:00:55.514, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. We have a great show. Like I said, we are talking with Jason Urban, head of trading at Galaxy Digital. It's a great conversation. He's been trading in markets of all types for a long time. He's got some great stories to tell us about the old days in the pits in Chicago and much more. And of course, we're going to talk with our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading about markets.
00:00:55.514 - 00:01:19.970, Speaker A: But before we begin, I have to tell you, please refer to the link to the Disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or a recommendation, offer or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. We got that out of the way. I think we're ready to go. Let's get into it. Galaxy brains. Let's go to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. Bimnet, good to see you, man.
00:01:20.042 - 00:01:21.974, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on, as always.
00:01:22.714 - 00:01:40.294, Speaker A: I guess markets have been, I mean, in crypto markets where I, you know, where I start my day, usually we've seen sort of a grind higher, a slow grind higher over the last couple of days that has been, I think, welcomed by the market, although I wouldn't say it's been super dramatic. Why?
00:01:40.794 - 00:01:50.294, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, it comes back down to memes. There was this meme project on Solana that launched about a couple weeks ago called Bonk Bonk.
00:01:51.034 - 00:01:52.330, Speaker A: I have to say, I love the name.
00:01:52.402 - 00:02:11.458, Speaker B: Oh, it's great. And there's a dog on the graphic. Yeah. So people liked it, created it, enthusiasm amongst the soul community. The reason why there was so much enthusiasm is because it started to rally a lot, and it rallied because it's a meme project and there's a lot of zeros before the decimal point.
00:02:11.546 - 00:02:17.178, Speaker A: Yeah. You've told me about the like from such a low basis, right. That this. What's the term that you like to use?
00:02:17.226 - 00:02:17.730, Speaker B: Base effect.
00:02:17.802 - 00:02:24.066, Speaker A: Base effect. The base effect, really, at play here, too. I mean, Solana was down dramatically after FTX.
00:02:24.210 - 00:02:33.294, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, just the easiest example. Let's say something goes from one hundred dollars to one dollar, that's a 99% move. But if it goes from one dollar.
00:02:33.334 - 00:02:35.446, Speaker A: To two dollars afterwards, that's 100% up.
00:02:35.470 - 00:03:05.354, Speaker B: That's 100% up. And so with a lot of crypto, there's a tremendous amount of base effects at play. And so when you had a retail phenomenon like Bonk come out and you had a heavy short base in a name like Solana, where funding was really negative, it tends to cause squeezes, because it's like, okay, I have a $20 million short on. It goes from eight dollars to twelve dollars. I've just lost $10 million out of thin air.
00:03:06.294 - 00:03:09.126, Speaker A: So it feels like a small move in sole, historically.
00:03:09.190 - 00:03:13.694, Speaker B: I mean, the thing was at 200 a year ago, if it goes from eight to twelve, that's not a big.
00:03:13.734 - 00:03:15.182, Speaker A: Deal, but it's a 50% move.
00:03:15.238 - 00:03:35.354, Speaker B: 50% move. And so there's a lot of base effects at play here, particularly in the alts. And so what you've had happen over the past week is anything where people were short, especially stuff where base effects are very relevant, that stuff got squeezed and led to forced liquidations during periods of low liquidity, and that broadly caused.
00:03:35.434 - 00:03:41.094, Speaker A: The market to go back and buy back their shit. And if they're physically short, a classic short squeeze.
00:03:42.554 - 00:03:44.162, Speaker B: So it doesn't feel fundamental.
00:03:44.338 - 00:03:58.510, Speaker A: Fair enough. Fair enough. And the bonk. But the fundamental. Well, hold on. First on bonk actually kind of an interesting project in this way that I'll say, which is, this is a meme coin, but it was airdropped to NFT holders on Solana. Yep.
00:03:58.510 - 00:04:21.184, Speaker A: The team, I guess, had an allocation for themselves, but they burned it. Provably, yes. So it becomes a fair launch dog meme coin. That rallied some excitement, at least to use the chain. Right. You'd go out on chain and get it or whatever, and you could see this in on chain data on Solana. There was a lot of activity around this at a time when they desperately needed some.
00:04:21.184 - 00:04:28.212, Speaker A: Yeah, some hopium. But really, I mean, some will say, I mean, what can you do with Bonk, right? Nothing. It's useless. Right? I mean, that's.
00:04:28.308 - 00:04:28.732, Speaker C: But.
00:04:28.828 - 00:04:48.562, Speaker A: And this has been the argument from some web3 investors that I know, where they say, like, but the token itself can create, even if it's only a token. Think about the word token literally means, like, a placeholder. Right. Even if that's all it is, it can be used to incentivize and energize a community, which is interesting. It appears to have been what had happened here.
00:04:48.748 - 00:04:56.998, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, it's not gonna energize smart money. It's not gonna energize large pools of capital to move into the space.
00:04:57.046 - 00:05:08.726, Speaker A: And when the knockoffs come out, like bink, bonk, bonk, bonk, they're not gonna do anything. But it's not a bullet. You can fire that often as a community to. But there was a lot of activity there. I think that's what.
00:05:08.750 - 00:05:10.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that was the catalyst.
00:05:10.182 - 00:05:18.240, Speaker A: And then the fundamentals, with a lack of. For sellers in other assets, like bitcoin and stuff. I mean, yeah.
00:05:18.272 - 00:05:18.624, Speaker B: Where is.
00:05:18.664 - 00:05:19.844, Speaker A: Where is the pain trade?
00:05:20.384 - 00:05:21.080, Speaker B: It's higher.
00:05:21.152 - 00:05:21.648, Speaker A: It's higher.
00:05:21.736 - 00:05:53.930, Speaker B: It's higher, for sure. I think there's been a lot of de risking that's happened. People have gotten positions down to their bare bones, essentially. Most crypto native folks that I talk to that deploy capital in this space have been very cautious and defensively positioned. That's the same for basically all risk assets for the most part. And so the pain trade's definitely higher. I mean, if you just think about it, like, if ETH in the first ten days of the year is up 10%, right.
00:05:53.930 - 00:06:05.586, Speaker B: There's probably a lot of guys that don't have it on in size, and their investors are going to be like, okay, eats up 12% in ten days of the year. You're only up two. Like, what's going on?
00:06:05.650 - 00:06:06.294, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:06.874 - 00:06:41.872, Speaker B: And so there's some of that at play. But broadly speaking, I think that the macro backdrop has been fairly constructive to start the year. Last week, we had the soft ism figures that caused the market to rally. The soft average hourly earnings figures. The macro backdrop has been, okay. And then if you think about what crypto was doing to start the year, there was so much bad news that came out to start the year. There's the OCC stuff, the Voyager binance investigation.
00:06:41.872 - 00:06:44.680, Speaker B: I mean, it was literally, like, endless.
00:06:44.792 - 00:06:46.568, Speaker A: The drip, drip on FTX and related.
00:06:46.656 - 00:07:01.512, Speaker B: Stuff, et cetera, and the market couldn't go down. It tells you seller exhaustion. And so the moment you had any bit of good in the space, that caused short liquidations and prices to rally, et cetera.
00:07:01.648 - 00:07:17.464, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I've been saying this, that if you're not. When you talk about how it couldn't go down. Right. These things have a large and dedicated group of people that believe in them, own them, want to build on them, use them, and at some point they're.
00:07:17.584 - 00:07:18.448, Speaker B: There is a floor.
00:07:18.536 - 00:07:26.560, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a floor. And I've said for a long time that there's a cult of decentralization. That's part of what is driving. This is a social movement.
00:07:26.672 - 00:07:27.408, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:07:27.456 - 00:07:36.930, Speaker A: And there are sub movements inside it, obviously, with different goals and, and roadmaps. But, like, this is broadly more than simply a technology or an asset.
00:07:37.002 - 00:08:08.614, Speaker B: No, I mean, I think every single investor or person that thinks about this space in a critical way is definitely focused on that. I mean, you just think about the events of the year, right? The dollar was basically used as a weapon this year, right? They shut off all the oligarchs, the financials for all the russian banks and the Chinese are looking at that and being like, okay, we have to, like, diversify, et cetera. Basically everybody, right?
00:08:09.114 - 00:08:14.266, Speaker A: And they've all been, by the way, all the global central banks have been buying gold, stacking gold, a couple.
00:08:14.330 - 00:08:48.594, Speaker B: Yes, they have been. And I think that's totally reasonable. But I tell you that if they already had bitcoin on their balance sheet, they'd be stacking bitcoin. It's just because, like, they have gold, they have gold. And it's also, the Chinese are a big driver of it, and they're obviously not pro decentralization. And so there's a lot of folks thinking very critically about money, the decentralization of it. And ultimately, I do think that puts a floor on bitcoin.
00:08:48.594 - 00:09:09.810, Speaker B: Right. If you're some saudi billionaire or some rich guy, you're constantly afraid of government's taking your money, you not having paid your taxes, et cetera, if you're a sovereign state, you're worried about sanctions and sanctions, geopolitics, all of that. And so there is a real place for decentralized money.
00:09:09.882 - 00:09:13.418, Speaker A: Yeah. Non sovereign, sound money is a use case.
00:09:13.586 - 00:09:54.960, Speaker B: And the bigger it is and the more liquid, the more credibility it has, it becomes self fulfilling, et cetera. And I also think that one of the reasons when bitcoin was taking off and one of the properties of money that you like a lot is stable value. The longer that bitcoin can hover around 17,000, 18,000, whatever, and hold its value, the more constructive the argument is that's what you want in money anyway. It's something that stores value. Well, I think in prior periods in the market, it's traded like a very speculative asset. Totally fine. I mean, just even think about the dollar.
00:09:54.960 - 00:10:43.136, Speaker B: I mean, there were points where dollar yen had moved 30% in a year. And bitcoin moving down 65% isn't that crazy in the context of things. But taking a step back, the one lesson that I would give folks about regular currencies and g ten fx in general, which are ten of the most prominent currencies out there, and throw in dollar China and a couple other ems. But currencies are historically one of the biggest mean reverting assets on the planet. They will swing up and down in value. But you take a look at the 30 year chart of some of these currencies, they're right back to where they were 15 years ago. The ranges for currencies have already been established, except em, that just dollar em stuff goes crazy, goes up a lot, et cetera.
00:10:43.136 - 00:11:18.624, Speaker B: But in the current world, I think it's fairly reasonable to expect currencies to be mean, reverting for a while. Once you have critical mass in bitcoin, it's going to behave that way, is what I'm thinking. In the long run, 510 years down the line. So bitcoin back to 30k in two years. That's so easy. If you establish a range of 30 to 60, that wouldn't be that crazy either. In a year where you've moved 65% and in a year where inflation is going the other way.
00:11:18.624 - 00:11:24.224, Speaker B: Now, most likely we can get into that a little bit later, but we're probably going to see a negative month on month print this month.
00:11:24.304 - 00:11:30.804, Speaker A: So that's tomorrow recording on Wednesday. Yep, tomorrow CPI is published and then this comes out Friday. So hello, Friday.
00:11:31.104 - 00:11:56.906, Speaker B: But yeah, so you're having dollar weaken this to start the year. Yields move lower, stocks move higher. There's been an unwind of what was happening last year. And so I think it's totally fair to make a prediction that you'll see a little bit of reversal in bitcoin as well in that kind of context. Right. If the dollar sells off by ten to 15%, you'll see some absolutely feedback into bitcoin.
00:11:56.970 - 00:12:00.202, Speaker A: So CPI tomorrow, what are the, what are we expecting here?
00:12:00.258 - 00:12:23.634, Speaker B: So it's very interesting, CPI, there are a couple of things that matter about CPI or there's a lot of things, but in terms of like what I'm focused on as a trader is a couple of things, right? One where expectations are not just the number, right? If stuff, if it comes in above expectations versus lower than expectations, that's going.
00:12:23.634 - 00:12:26.274, Speaker A: To, that's most of the ballgame, right? That's the ball game for near term.
00:12:26.314 - 00:12:27.082, Speaker B: Move on the day.
00:12:27.138 - 00:12:28.306, Speaker A: Yeah, for the on the day movie, right.
00:12:28.330 - 00:12:46.734, Speaker B: And so what's been happening is that a bunch of sell side institutions have been forecasting a lower number than what the economists were forecasting officially on Bloomberg. And so you've seen the Bloomberg month on month headline number go from zero to like neg one.
00:12:47.914 - 00:12:53.298, Speaker A: I see. So now the Bloomberg, the expectation is for softer. Softer.
00:12:53.346 - 00:13:07.866, Speaker B: And so expectations have been moving lower over the past week. And I think that's totally reasonable given the data set that we have. One of the things is just gas prices. Right? Again, they've been moving down November and December. That's a huge one.
00:13:07.890 - 00:13:12.290, Speaker A: That's one you can see on the chevron or whatever sign as you drive by.
00:13:12.362 - 00:13:13.258, Speaker B: Yep, absolutely.
00:13:13.306 - 00:13:28.386, Speaker A: And you drive by every day and you notice that it goes lower. I mean, that's something everyone, that makes everyone. That's actually one. It's like, that is one of the really interesting. Inflation is so driven by like personal behavior, right? Like if people think things are expensive, they might buy less.
00:13:28.450 - 00:13:32.250, Speaker B: I mean, expectations for inflation are just as important as inflation.
00:13:32.322 - 00:13:42.770, Speaker A: And this is a billboard that people all around the country see every day. That is their own personal check mark or sort of where they can follow inflation, quote unquote, as gas gets cheaper.
00:13:42.962 - 00:14:23.710, Speaker B: That is a feedback loop into tons of other things and also expectations of where people think inflation is going to be. But in my head, the way I think about inflation is it comes down to a handful of things, rents, owners, equivalent rental. The Fed has recently published a paper about how CPI right now is sort of lagged in terms of how it looks at rents. And they have a new index. I forgot what it's called, but essentially it's already suggesting a slowdown in rents. And home prices have obviously sort of topped out and are moving in the right direction. So I think housing and rent, you're probably safe in that it's headed in the right direction.
00:14:23.742 - 00:14:26.714, Speaker A: And that isn't something that causes CPI to go higher.
00:14:27.664 - 00:15:17.450, Speaker B: But tomorrow it won't be as relevant because you know that it's backward looking and the forward looking and more high frequency sort of data points suggest that it's constructive. Right. And then you have sort of the consumer goods, right, and the consumer goods have been trending in the right direction and having gas prices move lower are going to help them. And so one of the areas that we've been most concerned with that have been sticky has been in services pricing, like things like medical goods and leisure and hospitality services and things of that nature. Those prices have been relatively sticky. But what we had last Friday was ISM services that printed below 50 and showed contraction. We also had average hourly earnings that moved lower.
00:15:17.450 - 00:15:19.854, Speaker B: And so taking a step back.
00:15:21.734 - 00:15:22.046, Speaker C: The.
00:15:22.070 - 00:15:35.550, Speaker B: Growth in wages is also a key sort of component of our understanding of inflation. And that's also been moving lower in terms of not moving lower. But the month on month increases have been coming down to reasonable levels.
00:15:35.582 - 00:15:38.086, Speaker A: The growth has been succeeding. Correct.
00:15:38.270 - 00:16:17.074, Speaker B: So it's one thing to have a really tight labor market in terms of jobs outstanding and unemployed people, but it'd be another to have everybody's getting 510 percent raises. And so the fact that you're seeing the wage side of the inflation pressure is also moving down. That's good. And then with this CPI print, you have used autos and things of that nature. So you want to see broad weakness. And I think the market is set up for that right now. But I worry that there are, the risk is that it comes in flat or a bit higher than expected.
00:16:17.194 - 00:16:20.514, Speaker A: Expectations are now very low. This is the good setup for that.
00:16:20.554 - 00:17:00.280, Speaker B: So I think expectations have been anchored to the downside and also if it misses by a little bit to the downside, which is good because expectations have already started to move. And the trend, it might not impact markets that much. But taking a step back, we're at the point now where basically housing inflation, core goods inflation, consumer goods, some of the services stuff is probably going to start to turn. The labor side of the equation is starting to move in your favor. And this is going to be the third straight decline in CPI. And it looks like we've topped out right. So you hit a peak.
00:17:00.280 - 00:17:37.330, Speaker B: It's been moving lower and lower in a gradual way. And so the inflation picture in the US is getting a lot better. And that's kind of what you're seeing in the market in terms of pricing. And it's led to a bit of a discrepancy between what the market is pricing and versus what the Fed is pricing. 1520 basis point discrepancy in terminal rate expectations. And then there's a bigger discrepancy in terms of when the feds expect it to start cutting versus what the Fed's telling you, which is they're not cutting at all. It's the great debate, right?
00:17:37.362 - 00:18:05.374, Speaker A: The market versus the Fed on rates. Yeah, it's going to be really interesting. It does feels like the second half of this year for risk investing is when a lot of people are feeling like rates will have paused. And you said markets, even pricing perhaps cuts in q four, but that we still have both, perhaps generally in markets, but also in crypto, the first bit of this year feels like a continuation of a bit of the slog that we've been in.
00:18:05.494 - 00:18:20.446, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're totally right. But my one worry about it is it's just so consensus, right. It's like everybody's like, oh, inflation is going to fall, then Fed's going to change its tune back half of the year. Risk assets are going to rally.
00:18:20.470 - 00:18:21.518, Speaker A: It seems like too good a story.
00:18:21.566 - 00:18:27.806, Speaker B: You know, so good, guys, I just worry about that because this inflation, it's.
00:18:27.870 - 00:18:29.782, Speaker A: Like, it's sticky and it's scary.
00:18:29.838 - 00:19:03.494, Speaker B: Inflation, it's the one thing that I would say is different than other prior periods. There have been a lot of folks doing, like, historical studies about, like, you know, how is this seventies style? Is this great depression, like, been a lot of historical analysis. Right, right. And I think the biggest things that people are missing are, one, the excess reserve environment. What I mean by that is the amount of money that's just floating in the system that's just been printed over the past decade. Right. You're talking about abundant levels of excess reserves.
00:19:03.494 - 00:19:21.358, Speaker B: There is no scarcity of dollars. Right. There's $2.3 trillion in the reverse repo facility. That is money that has to literally get drained out of the system because it doesn't want to buy any assets. Right. It's excess reserves that are in the banking system.
00:19:21.358 - 00:19:46.230, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of money in the system that's just idly waiting there to get deployed once they get the signal from the Fed to deploy. And then you have this crazy investor fervor in the US where the moment it's risk on, it's piling meme stocks like crazy. I mean, the meme stocks today are ripping.
00:19:46.302 - 00:19:46.934, Speaker A: Are they really?
00:19:47.014 - 00:20:07.486, Speaker B: They are, right? And you'll see the same stuff. So you'll start a speculative frenzy the moment the Fed, like, turns around. And then it's like, okay, interest rates move lower and it's like, demographically, like, people still want to buy houses, right? If home mortgage rates go from seven to five, people are going to buy. People are going to start buying again. Right.
00:20:07.550 - 00:20:09.294, Speaker A: Man, it's hard to unwind this stuff.
00:20:09.374 - 00:20:46.062, Speaker B: And then the other most important part of this that people are really missing is the labor market. You're talking about 3.5% unemployment rate. If you want a job, you basically have it, right? And you're getting a good job because you're getting raises, et cetera. But it's not like you have that much room to go lower. If people have jobs, if they're stuck in 30 year mortgages that they got on two handles or low threes, people are going to spend money, they're going to feel fine. And the moment stuff goes back the other direction, it could go hard.
00:20:46.062 - 00:21:10.158, Speaker B: It could go, the inflation cycle could just resume. And so I think people are dramatically underestimating how quickly inflation can pick back up once the fed starts to turn. Because right now I look at the data set, et cetera, and everybody's like, oh, stuff slowing down, et cetera. And then I'm like, well, did you look at consumer spending in Q four?
00:21:10.326 - 00:21:11.574, Speaker A: It's up high, right?
00:21:11.614 - 00:21:20.118, Speaker B: It's up like nominal growth is expected to be high. Home prices haven't fallen off that much. Yeah, you have used auto.
00:21:20.166 - 00:21:46.946, Speaker A: That point you make, though, really scares me. And it's totally right because the second everybody says, oh my gosh, it's time to redeploy and do more stuff, oh, the rates are going to come down. Then that counteracts the whole mission of the fed and could cause it. And this is the thing you're talking about the historicals, right? In the seventies, they tried to get inflation under control and failed multiple times before Volcker had to drop the hammer, right? Absolutely. That is a fear, and that's what.
00:21:46.970 - 00:22:01.498, Speaker B: The Fed's afraid of. And that's why they're so aggressive about hammering home the point that they're not cutting this year. And that's what they have to do because it's always politically convenient to make markets rip.
00:22:01.546 - 00:22:17.802, Speaker A: And it's also about expectations. So they're trying to control expectations. We're going to keep this story going, man. It's going to be an interesting year, so I'll look forward to it. So that's, that's it for now. Bimnet Aviv Galaxy Digital training thank you so much. Quick break for our listeners.

But if you would like to suggest other guests for this show, internal or external, hit us up with that as well.
00:22:50.820 - 00:23:01.260, Speaker A: And we'd love to hear from you, as always. That's it. Let's get into the interview with Jason. Let's go now to Jason Urban, head of trading at Galaxy Digital. Great to see you, Jason. Welcome to the show.
00:23:01.332 - 00:23:02.892, Speaker C: Thanks for having me here. Alex. This is great.
00:23:02.948 - 00:23:13.954, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a long time coming. I was going to have you on. You remember during the FTX thing when we thought it was merely interesting, then it turned into the debacle that it became and you were indisposed.
00:23:14.974 - 00:23:16.998, Speaker C: There were more pressing issues at the moment.
00:23:17.086 - 00:23:43.254, Speaker A: There were, yeah. So, but it's great to have you here for our audience. Jason runs trading at Galaxy, one of our five business units, and it's an important one. But I want to get into it with Jason because first of all, you've been in markets for a long time, and we're going to talk about Jason's backstory and how he got started in the options markets, and then we'll talk about how you got into crypto. And we'll talk about crypto. But let's start it. What was your first job in markets?
00:23:43.914 - 00:24:07.668, Speaker C: I took a job out of college, ended up with Goldman, and they were in the analyst program and they were like, well, we bought this company in Chicago that's into options. And I really liked options. I was trading options through college a little bit. So I went out there and it was hull trading, which was the algorithmic trading business, but it was also a markets floor, markets based business. And they're like, well, you're big and you're new.
00:24:07.756 - 00:24:08.876, Speaker A: You mean physically tall?
00:24:08.940 - 00:24:44.196, Speaker C: Physically tall. That's the interesting thing about the pits. I always joke that. So I'll tell you that. So I went there, I spent about six or seven years down in the pits and then came upstairs and started doing that. But that period of time in the crowd, it's one of the places where physical size matters, location to people, because it's like yelling at someone in a crowded subway. And it's one of the very few places where you can still solve a problem with your fists if it ever devolved to that, where you can, like I said, buy them.
00:24:44.196 - 00:24:44.844, Speaker C: You said sold.
00:24:44.884 - 00:24:47.164, Speaker A: No, like, we're going to hash this out right here.
00:24:47.204 - 00:25:07.898, Speaker C: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Like people get separated and there's, you know, it gets a little chippy. You know, it's an interesting dynamic because you're in a lot of ways, it's a lot like crypto. You're, you're in competition with the person that you stand next to for 8 hours a day that you literally are, are hip to hip with them for 8 hours. There is no secrets. You know, there is no anything.
00:25:07.898 - 00:25:29.242, Speaker C: And so you naturally talk to them, but then all of a sudden, at the drop of a hat, something would happen and you're both competing for the same thing. And so somebody who's your dear friend five minutes ago and sharing wonderful stories about, oh, your baby did this to like two minutes later, I hope you die in a pit. And I want to. I'm gonna get that trade. So it was, you know, a very different, very different thing.
00:25:29.338 - 00:25:31.394, Speaker A: Do the pits exist like that anymore?
00:25:31.554 - 00:26:03.348, Speaker C: Truthfully, I don't know. They were dying for years and years. And I think that when COVID happened, that was kind of the end of it. But it was an interesting time because you had to think really fast on your feet. Like, there was no, you know, like now if you're not sure on something or you want to triple check something, you have the opportunity to look at a screen and buy yourself 30 seconds down there. There was no buying time, and the person was right next to you. Now, it was great for market color and understanding things.
00:26:03.348 - 00:26:15.236, Speaker C: It was terrible for being on the spot. Like, if you made a mistake, like, and your word is your bond on there. Sold means sold. And, yeah, you know, like, there is no hiding. Like, if you screw somebody, you've screwed them for life, right.
00:26:15.260 - 00:26:16.348, Speaker A: Because it's a person right there in.
00:26:16.356 - 00:26:23.252, Speaker C: Your face like that, you know, that you're going to see out on the street some, like, with their family at brunch, like, crazy things.
00:26:23.308 - 00:26:24.308, Speaker A: So what were you trading?
00:26:24.356 - 00:26:45.088, Speaker C: Primarily s and p options. So evolve. So we were, we were at the cutting, cutting edge of, you know, as we evolved, we, you know, the time Goldman invented the tradable ViX. So then we were trading VIx versus listed, and then we started doing variant swaps and other things. And so we just financial engineering and Valarb across multiple products.
00:26:45.256 - 00:26:47.404, Speaker A: Do you ever do anything in commodities?
00:26:47.744 - 00:27:20.098, Speaker C: Yeah, we've talked a little bit, you and I, out of here. But when I left Goldman in zero nine after the crisis to go and basically start the equities business at DRW with a group of my team. And while I was at DRW, it was a tremendously entrepreneurial place, kind of like galaxy that you could try. You were given the leash to try things if it made financial sense. And without getting into a crazy long story, we ended up. I have a rail car business outside of this business that I.
00:27:20.266 - 00:27:20.970, Speaker A: Rail cars?
00:27:21.042 - 00:27:22.386, Speaker C: Rail cars, railroads.
00:27:22.570 - 00:27:24.354, Speaker A: Just the cars?
00:27:24.394 - 00:27:26.814, Speaker C: Yeah. You see them with the spray paint on those. Usually.
00:27:27.154 - 00:27:27.890, Speaker A: You own those?
00:27:27.962 - 00:27:52.590, Speaker C: Yeah, just the ugly ones. And so we were talking about moving corn from low basis to high basis and that trade and some, you know, one of my rules, and it's a rule in GDT, always be nice. If you're nice, people want to do things with you. It's really easy. You could have a choice to be nice or mean. So I was always nice. And I was talking to this old farmer one day, and I was like, I really want to get corn from low basis in central Nebraska to the high basis.
00:27:52.590 - 00:28:29.042, Speaker C: It was trading 50% below the futures market in central Nebraska in the spot market, and it was trading 50% above the futures market in Arizona. And I was like, I'm trying to find a way to get the corn from central Nebraska to Arizona, and I'm going to make 100% of my money, net of transportation costs. We're trying to get the numbers to work and the farmer system. You want to know how to get corn from low basis to high. You don't know how to get six pounds of corn from central Nebraska to Arizona. And I was like, yeah, how do you do it? You know, like, I thought he was going to tell me some secret. And he's like, you walk it out on four legs.
00:28:29.042 - 00:28:49.250, Speaker C: And I said, walk it out on four legs? What do you mean? He said, well, it takes six pounds of corn to make one pound of beef. Six pounds of corn costs seventy two cents. One pound of beef trades at $1.29. So this will tell you when this was. And I was like, so he's like, you take the six pounds, you feed it to a feeder cattle. They grow, they make. They turn the six pounds of corn into one pound of beef, and then you sell it for $1.29.
00:28:49.250 - 00:29:07.130, Speaker C: And that's how you do it. And then you can move the. The cattle wherever you want. You put them on a truck and send them. And so I was like, wow, you're right. And then all of a sudden, you started thinking about the impact to that. So then it led to a pig farm, oil and gas, and you name it, it kind of spirals.
00:29:07.130 - 00:29:53.412, Speaker C: So in addition to trading volume and trying to figure out forward starting variant swaps, we were also like, do we want to buy the black Angus or are we going with the white Hereford on this badge? Totally different. Like, keeping your brain yourself a little bit. Which is what led me to crypto in a lot of ways, because at DRW, there were about ten or twelve of us that ran the different business units. And we were having a dinner one night where the person that I was running the cattle business with, we brought all the different, we had the same kitchen, prepare the same cut of meat from either grass fed, corn fed, non hormone treated, all the different kinds. And we're saying we're going to do a taste test and it's going to be cooked by the same chef the same way, same controlling way, everything. And so the ten people, we had a little room was the end of the year type of, type of celebration.
00:29:53.428 - 00:29:56.332, Speaker A: So this is a great dinner, but it's a research project.
00:29:56.508 - 00:30:27.332, Speaker C: That's exactly what it was. Both. And so I was sitting there talking to the guy next to me, and this is before Cumberland was really a thing at DRW. And the guy sitting across from me, and he'll remain nameless, he turns to his buddy and he says, I just bought 200,000 ETH for a quarter. Now, I didn't know what ETH was, but when you're at a dinner with ten traders and somebody says, I bought 200,000 of anything, it's like a, I was like, hold on a second. I said, xYz, what did you just do? He said, I bought 200,000 ether for a quarter. Now I'm doing commodity stuff.
00:30:27.332 - 00:30:51.472, Speaker C: And I jokingly said, are you a dentist? What are you doing? He's like, no, ethereum. I bought 200,000 ethereum for a quarter. So you can figure out what year that was. And at first I discounted it. I was like, oh, yeah, this crazy Internet money. I made the mistake in the late nineties of discounting the Internet. I said, the Internet's great.
00:30:51.472 - 00:31:36.608, Speaker C: You get your AOL disk in the mail and you plug it in, you get 50 of those disks, encarta, all of that. And I was like, oh, that's just going to be, it's great for Internet and watching porn or whatever, but no one's going to do commerce now. I come home everyday and there's 50 Amazon boxes. I said, I'm never going to make that mistake again, where I missed something because I was, I was too myopic in my thought process. So after I kind of laughed at this guy and made a few jokes about, oh, yeah, sure, EMP is going to happen, where's your money now? I went home and I started learning about it, and that was what opened me up to crypto personally and then professionally, was watching what we were doing on the Cumberland side of the house at DRW. And as I thought through, I was like, this is here to stay. This is for real.
00:31:36.608 - 00:32:07.456, Speaker C: We know what's going on in the broader financial market. And I looked at the ecosystem and I said, what is it that we can do? I can trade. And at that time, it was still very easy to arb. You could buy twos here and sell sixes over there and make your nice $4 and walk away. You could do that all day. I was like, but the large organizations like Galaxy are going to eventually get into this and it becomes a black box game, a money game. I said, but the lending game, I don't see the lenders stepping in here for a very long time.
00:32:07.456 - 00:32:37.844, Speaker C: I have a much longer Runway to start a business. And that was, I think, where you and I, when I started drawing and we met each other and you were at Fido, and I was hanging out a shingle trying to raise money. And Galaxy was one of those investors. And over time, it just became, it made a lot of sense, given structured products, derivatives, lending, all the things that we were doing here, that instead of me being a large client of the firm, it made sense to kind of roll that together. That was how I ended up here.
00:32:38.914 - 00:32:51.538, Speaker A: What a great story, too. And I mean, I'm laughing about the steak dinner and the cows do this. Wait, so did you, by the way, I'm a big. I love beef. Did you end up coming out with what was the best cut on that one, by the way? Do you remember?
00:32:51.586 - 00:32:56.930, Speaker C: You know what I do. There were two. So the one that we weren't doing, which was clearly the best cut, was wagyu.
00:32:57.002 - 00:32:57.274, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:57.314 - 00:33:10.582, Speaker C: So they had that and they brought it out. I'm disputed champion, but the one that was surprisingly the best was, and it was consensus, was the Holstein, which is a milk cow.
00:33:10.678 - 00:33:11.150, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:33:11.222 - 00:33:54.270, Speaker C: And they're really, they're primarily sold to Walmart. And what that is, is, which is interesting is they've genetically engineered the Holstein to produce, when the mother births, it's like 90% females, because it replenishes the milk producing herd. But there's 10% that are males and they don't, you know, in the old days, they would literally, it was inhumane. They would take them out back and shoot them. And then somebody said, well, I'll just take them for free, right? And then they started feeding them for free, and you could sell them for ground beef to McDonald's or whatever. And then somebody, then there became a real market, and by the time I was in it, it was already kind of becoming a real market, you know, and there's some interesting, some interesting things. So the Holstein was the best tasting of all, right.
00:33:54.270 - 00:33:56.790, Speaker C: That was, you know, buy your stakes at Walmart.
00:33:56.862 - 00:34:03.358, Speaker A: All right. I love to hear it. Okay, Jason, so just a couple more things. Let's talk about crypto a little bit. I mean, just enough.
00:34:03.406 - 00:34:06.086, Speaker C: Enough for the cattle. Let's talk about what we really care about.
00:34:06.150 - 00:34:24.430, Speaker A: Yeah, well, let's get to this year, or I guess I even say the last. We'll say the last year. I mean, it was, it was a. You've been in these markets for a long time. I have to. I mean, what was your just impression on the, the feel of the bear market year, if we call it part of a bear market cycle? Although, of course, there was black swan after Black Swan.
00:34:24.462 - 00:34:32.478, Speaker C: Well, yeah, you know, it was interesting because, you know, one, you know, three black swans become the flock at that point. So after the first one, I think.
00:34:32.486 - 00:34:35.914, Speaker A: We'Re going to call it a murder, which is what? What is a flock of crows?
00:34:38.774 - 00:35:16.192, Speaker C: Well, not for us. It's been a very, very fortuitous year for us in a lot of ways. When the first one happened, you're like, okay, we've seen this before, and it's the terror ordeal. And you knew there was going to be more that kind of shook out of that. You didn't know who, but you can't destroy $20 billion of value and not have somebody take a little bit of hit. Three arrows came along and we were doing business there, and we were very quick to make adjustments and move our business in the right direction there. You thought, okay, that's it.
00:35:16.192 - 00:35:20.648, Speaker C: There might be a little bit more. And then obviously, this most recent, and.
00:35:20.656 - 00:35:24.684, Speaker A: You had the lenders to the other lenders, the non drawbridge lenders, all suffered.
00:35:25.464 - 00:35:44.104, Speaker C: Well, and it's interesting because in the early days, I was thinking back, there was a panel that I did, I want to say it was in 2018, and it was me, Mike Morrow and Alex Mashinsky on the panel. And I was thinking like, I was the little fish at the time because we were the smallest of the three.
00:35:44.144 - 00:35:46.044, Speaker A: Lenders, Genesis in Celsius.
00:35:46.624 - 00:35:57.164, Speaker C: And I was saying to myself, like, you look back on that, I wish I had a picture of that panel, the three of us sitting there. And I just remember Mashinsky just talking over me the entire time, and I'm like, alex, enough.
00:35:59.064 - 00:36:40.482, Speaker A: So those guys, then, a lot of that was also fallout or just general mismanagement, obviously, as it looks like from the bankruptcy proceedings and some of those. But then FTX, I mean, what was the, I mean, this was a, this was, I was here. I mean, we lived that. It was a traumatic week. I mean, I think if our audience goes back and listens to our episode on the week of November 7 or whichever day, Friday that is, you'll hear a 25 minutes rant from me about how mad I was at FTX and am still. But what was your sense there? I mean, that was the, it turns out, right. We think they were underwater half a year earlier, maybe, and covering it up.
00:36:40.482 - 00:36:40.850, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:40.922 - 00:37:25.900, Speaker C: Yeah. You know, and it was funny because there's nothing funny about it, but it was, if you had asked us collectively as an industry, you know, who are some of the titans of your industry? It turns out that one of them was just a. And that's the hardest thing to risk manage against. You can risk manage against market moves. You can read people when they mismanage, when someone's that good at defrauding people, it was tough. And that's not to hide myself from responsibility for anything, what happened. But it was certainly you asked how I felt about this when it first started.
00:37:25.900 - 00:37:56.708, Speaker C: It felt like some of the other times in the crypto. Yeah, anytime you have an emerging technology, and I was reading up, speaking of railroads, about some of the railroad things that happened in the 1890s and the early 19 hundreds, and how you had this new revolutionary technology that's going to change the way people do things, the way commerce is done. You do get this. You get these manias, you get these. And it takes time to work its way through. The system started happening. I was like, okay, this is another one of these.
00:37:56.796 - 00:37:59.308, Speaker A: It's a cyclical bubble in crypto, right?
00:37:59.436 - 00:38:39.684, Speaker C: And we need to grow up collectively as an industry and create some rules, whether it's SRo, self regulatory organization, or things of that. But this is part of that process. We're all going to get to where I thought we should have been when I started drawbridge and we took the approach we took relative to competition was like a measured, responsible thought process around asset backed lending. And I said, okay, this is part of that. And then it just kind of kept going. And by the time you hit, you know, you hit November and the FTX debacle, it was, it was like, okay, this is it. Like we like, as you've come in the heat of the battle, you just, it's just survival.
00:38:39.684 - 00:38:45.348, Speaker C: Like you're in the fog of war. You're not really, you're not worried about, like, did I make the right career choice?
00:38:45.476 - 00:39:28.106, Speaker A: The scale of the rugging from them and the brazenness, it wasn't, oh, the business didn't work out, and it was taken out by the market forces this was apparently a giant theft. So we need, I think I said on that FTX week episode that we want decentralization. That's why a lot of us got involved in this space, obviously. But if you're not going to be decentralized, let's say you're not a protocol, you're a company, you better be open, transparent, audited. And I would like it to be regulated, I think, the way companies are. And we need that transparency from centralized firms. So I don't know.
00:39:28.106 - 00:39:52.744, Speaker A: But then you look at the congress, what's going to be a pretty humorous, like, gridlock there. So I don't know if we're going to get a lot of actual movement on these various proposals that have been made to clarify for the US how businesses can operate in these markets. But, like at scale. Right. So we're at an interesting time. I think we're unlikely to see that clarity anytime really soon.
00:39:53.044 - 00:39:58.036, Speaker C: I agree with that. And you're right. Like, regulation is so important and we embrace it.
00:39:58.060 - 00:39:58.220, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:58.252 - 00:40:16.046, Speaker C: Like, I know that if you just tell us what the rules are, that we will be successful in what we choose to do, but we need to know the rules. And I think the problems that we've had have been. There are no rules. And so firms like ours who have taken a. A more measured approach in certain areas.
00:40:16.150 - 00:40:18.094, Speaker A: Well, I mean, we try to run it like there are rules.
00:40:18.174 - 00:40:18.502, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:18.558 - 00:40:20.166, Speaker A: Like what we think the rules should be.
00:40:20.190 - 00:40:26.830, Speaker C: Should be. Or using, or using the existing rules in other markets as a guide rail corollary. You know, these are the guardrails.
00:40:26.862 - 00:40:27.102, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:27.158 - 00:40:44.916, Speaker C: But it was frustrating for. There were times where there was a period of time where I was, like, frustrated. I was like, I'm watching my competition do things that I know is wrong, that I know is profitable for them in the moment that we would like, I wouldn't even ask to do. But I was like, how do I compete?
00:40:45.100 - 00:41:12.618, Speaker A: This is where the lack of a clear regulatory framework and policy harms us innovation, because this sends people to the Seychelles and the wherever, isle of light, remember the isle of man, Gibraltar, where they can go and become the largest in the world. And the regulated firms, without the clarity, can't participate or offer the products that those growing firms are offering. Or if they do, they find themselves in a gray area.
00:41:12.786 - 00:41:18.210, Speaker C: And you run a lot of risk. And that's risk that we're not comfortable taking as long as something like 42%.
00:41:18.282 - 00:41:35.178, Speaker A: Of all crypto startups that received funding last year, venture funding, are headquartered in the US. So there is a huge, huge impetus, in my view, for policymakers to do something here and make sure that we don't lose. Let's make sure that 42% doesn't become 22% or 10%.
00:41:35.226 - 00:41:36.330, Speaker C: How many, how many people do?
00:41:36.362 - 00:41:36.826, Speaker A: Do you know?
00:41:36.850 - 00:42:17.370, Speaker C: And I know, I know quite a few who were in the earlier days, the 1718 era, who have left the United States. People who were a lot. A lot. We as the United States, as a place that's the shining beacon on the hill, you know, to attract talent globally and to create innovation. That is what makes the US a special place, one of the many things. But when you think about that, if you're going to take that innovative spirit, that, that financial darwinism, whatever you want to call it, and push it away, because you can't figure out a set of rules to work with, give us some rules and let's build on them. Let's not.
00:42:17.370 - 00:42:45.304, Speaker C: Let's start with you. Don't build Rome wasn't built in a day. You're not going to build it all at once. But give us something or let us, from a self regulatory perspective, let us establish something and then you tell us, no, we should tweak this as opposed to coming in with draconian measures that say crypto, it's not evil. Like anything. Nuclear power is not evil. You can use it to make a bomb or you can use it to run a city.
00:42:45.304 - 00:42:55.024, Speaker C: It's what you do with it. Crypto and decentralization is innovation. It is progress. Let's embrace it. Let's not kick it to the curb.
00:42:55.564 - 00:43:11.784, Speaker A: Love that. Jason, one last question. So we looked back a little bit at the tumultuous 22. What are you thinking about? 23. How does this feel? I know year to date markets look good, but this is my joke, right? What are we on date? Eleven. We're recording this on Wednesday. I was like, year to date, we look great.
00:43:12.964 - 00:43:46.196, Speaker C: And truly, here's the bittersweet bit of it from a galaxy perspective. We are finally going to be recognized and are being recognized for being prudent, responsible risk managers and access to these markets. And people are finally saying, you know what? I still want to participate. And we are picking up a lot of share for that. Unfortunately, the size of the pie is small right now because of we're at peak Fud in Tradfi. Tradfi's view of crypto is peak fud.
00:43:46.260 - 00:43:49.380, Speaker A: And then macro and monetary policy stuff is.
00:43:49.532 - 00:44:19.354, Speaker C: There are definitely headwinds. I think that from a broader crypto perspective, I think the first half of the year will be a slog. It's not going to be. I think the forced selling and the capitulation is by the wayside. We might have one or two wicks lower, but nothing. I don't see a major retrenchment, but I also don't see a lot of catalysts. You can look at what's happening with ETH and maybe that will be a catalyst in late spring.
00:44:19.354 - 00:44:40.156, Speaker C: But I think the second half of the year, you'll see the Fed start to move and you'll see the markets start to reshift again. And I think that at that point, crypto starts to make a lot of sense for people who are looking at that fast money that's coming in and trying to take advantage of things. I think it always makes sense in a prudent portfolio.
00:44:40.260 - 00:44:40.628, Speaker A: Totally.
00:44:40.676 - 00:45:07.756, Speaker C: But I think that the second half of the year will be where the fun is. I think right now, at least from a galaxy perspective, we are gaining share and we are going to continue to gain share and position ourselves accordingly. And so right now, it's build, build, build, and that's what we're doing. We are rolling out a variety of things in the coming weeks and months that I think will be exciting for the market and required in the market. And so that's really where we're at.
