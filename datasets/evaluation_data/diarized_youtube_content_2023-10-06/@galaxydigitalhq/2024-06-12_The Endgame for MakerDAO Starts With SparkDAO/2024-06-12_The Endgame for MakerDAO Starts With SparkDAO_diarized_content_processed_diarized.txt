00:00:10.360 - 00:00:44.224, Speaker A: Welcome back to the infinite Jungle. Today on the show I have a recording from a live episode that I hosted at Coindesk Consensus, a crypto conference that was hosted this year in Austin, Texas at the end of May. On this show, I interview Alex Thorne, my boss, head of firm wide research at Galaxy, about the ETH ETF approval. And I also interview Ruin Christiansen, co founder of Makerdao, about the Endgame proposal. So lots of exciting stuff in this episode. Before we begin, here is a quick show disclaimer.
00:00:44.684 - 00:01:01.294, Speaker B: I need to remind you to please refer to the disclaimer linked in the podcast show notes and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice, an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:01.414 - 00:01:12.334, Speaker C: Hey Christine, great to be here. Wow, lots of stuff being worked on for this next upgrade. It's not, it's not simple, it's not the expanding the Max EB upgrade.
00:01:12.414 - 00:01:12.974, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:13.094 - 00:01:16.758, Speaker C: Why did they start with 32 ETH only in the first place?
00:01:16.886 - 00:01:47.772, Speaker B: There was quite a bit. Number one, it was technical. You need to have a certain number of votes of attestations to be able to confirm a block. And they weren't sure how many people would be interested in staking. Given at the time, they weren't sure when the merge was going to happen. The beacon chain was an entirely different network from Ethereum Mainnet, and they really wanted to ensure that the minimum requirement of stake was low enough that many people could participate, but not high enough that it prevented other people from participating. So it was a bit of a, you know, a shot in the dark.
00:01:47.772 - 00:01:50.876, Speaker B: And they said, look, we can change it if anything goes wrong.
00:01:51.020 - 00:02:15.024, Speaker C: And I guess nothing went wrong. But I mean, imagine you want to, let's say your institutional stake are these, these staking as a service platforms or whomever, lido even, right. They have to what, run dozens or hundreds or even thousands of independent 32 Eth? Just, it doesn't seem, it seems good that they're thinking about fixing that might easier for the infrastructure providers. They didn't lower. Is there still a minimum though?
00:02:15.104 - 00:02:50.718, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe the minimum is still going to be 32 eth, just because the problem right now is that there's too many validators and lowering it means that you would just allow more validators to come on. And it's a heavy load on the p two P network layer. So it's a very important change, but complex. And now they've added in peer Daz and now they're still considering a few other complex changes. I got to say, on the protocol front, I'm not super enthusiastic. I'm a bit concerned at the complexity of the upgrade. But on the regulatory front, I'm actually quite, quite pleased at how things have been developing for Ethereum.
00:02:50.806 - 00:03:49.970, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been really, I would say, a whirlwind three weeks. I won't recount necessarily the entire timeline, but let's go to the Ethereum ETPs, which everyone thought, we thought, I thought were very unlikely. We hadn't heard any feedback from the securities and Exchange Commission issuers broadly reported this. If you recall, in the fall of last year, when the bitcoin atps were sort of coming together, there were dozens of s one amendments, and we were looking at track changes between this filers to get some hints about what the SEC was asking them about, and then weigh the seriousness and volume of those asks and to try to come out to a view on the likelihood that they would eventually be passed. Well, there was no talk at all. Right. And then obviously what happened is last Monday, apparently the SEC reached out to all the exchanges and issuers and said, actually get us this thing by 10:00 a.m.
00:03:49.970 - 00:04:17.380, Speaker C: the next day. And then, of course, they were all approved. These are the 19 befores. This really is the major approval. This is actually the thing that says the exchanges, as in like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq and CBO are able to list an ethereum ETP. So a very, they don't have any Ethereum ATPs yet, but they're allowed to be listed. It's now a matter of putting through, like any company going public, the registration documents and process with the SEC.
00:04:17.380 - 00:04:40.610, Speaker C: That's the s one process. But you assume some will get through because they formally allowed exchanges to trade commodity linked Ethereum etPs. That's really the real question. And now, and now we just heard, I think the block reported this morning that s one issuers were given until 10:00 a.m. today on Friday to get back up a rough draft to the SEC of their s one.
00:04:40.642 - 00:04:52.976, Speaker B: So how does seem like, could we see that s one approval? I mean, if they get in their comments this by 10:00 a.m. this Friday, maybe within a few hours of this show being ended, we're going to see an s one approval.
00:04:53.040 - 00:05:38.114, Speaker C: No, no, unlikely. It's a draft by the issuer to the SEC. And the SEC will the division of Corporation Finance, which does ipos and these types of filings, think about listing an ETP or an ETF, that basically is like taking a company public. It's just a company whose sole purpose is to hold a basket or a single asset in a fund vehicle. Right. When we think about the bitcoin process, when issuers would make new filings to the SEC, it typically took about two weeks for the SEC to send comments back to the issuers. So if a bunch or any or all of the s one s that are sent into the SEC today are perfect and require no edits, you would think maybe within two weeks they could launch.
00:05:38.114 - 00:05:56.222, Speaker C: There's a variety of views on this. I think it will be longer than that, but maybe more like weeks to months, but I don't think six months. I think it, it seems like they're moving quickly now. So, you know, I think it's reasonable to think in a month or month and a half you might see these actually start trading.
00:05:56.318 - 00:06:20.514, Speaker B: Is it also reasonable to think that all the s one s are going to be approved, all the 19 v four s that have been approved, or a subset? Because with bitcoin's ETF approvals, they kind of, the SEC lined them up so that they all started at the same time, had the same kind of ability to. Nobody had a head start. Nobody. No bitcoin ETF product had a head start over the others. Is that also the strategy that you think is going to be taken here with the SEC?
00:06:21.294 - 00:06:57.904, Speaker C: Most likely, yes. Most likely, yes. It is a little interesting, if you think about it. Several of those bitcoin ETP issuers had applied years ago, and then some other newer ones applied only for the first time last year. Is it fair that someone that's been trying to do this for five or seven years now gets put in line at the same time as someone who just showed up? It kind of feels like some newer issuers were cutting the line a little bit. I think there are some longtime issuers who feel a little bit hurt over that. When you think of it from the SEC standpoint, however, it's pretty straightforward.
00:06:57.904 - 00:07:32.740, Speaker C: I mean, they're already kind of pick. They had been picking winners and losers sort of with bitcoin and no ETH or whatever in their regulatory enforcement strategy as well. They don't really want to be in a position, I think, of giving someone issue or a head start regardless of when they filed ETF's and funds in general the first few days matter, like what seed capital you put, the momentum that's driven when these things become large in an Aum sense, when they become traded very widely and have a nice big float. They're much more attractive vehicles than their competitors. That don't. Right. So it does matter.
00:07:32.740 - 00:08:11.314, Speaker C: I think that's what will happen. They'll try to align them all. It doesn't mean all of them will actually get through. There could be issues or process related that make it so that the SEC doesn't let through one or two or even we even saw one. Valkyrie withdrew their application, so for whatever reason, they're out. I think that this is a big deal for Ethereum, but I think. And the markets, but I think it's a smaller piece of a much, much bigger story, which is a rapid and dramatic shift in democratic party and White House political strategy vis a vis interactions with the cryptocurrency world, which, which is real.
00:08:11.314 - 00:08:20.334, Speaker C: We don't know if the policies will materialize in the end, but the politics have changed significantly and this feels like part of that story.
00:08:20.454 - 00:08:48.961, Speaker B: Yeah. I want to get into more of the broader implications of that political shift that the sentiment around of crypto in us politics shifting and its impact not just on this, on this ETF application, but on Defi, on Daos, which for quite a while we've been very bearish about. And to do that, I'd like to invite on our third guest for the show. That's right, we have two this time for infinite jungle. Thank you so much for being on the show, ruin.
00:08:49.097 - 00:08:50.281, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:08:50.457 - 00:09:22.364, Speaker B: We are very excited to talk about some of the broader implications of this political shift that we're seeing towards the crypto industry in us politics as it impacts Defi and Daos. And you being the co founder of Makerdao, pushing this really major change to Makerdao with the endgame proposal. I'd love to get your thoughts on kind of your take on how you've been reacting to some of the changes in the political environment in the US. Is it something that you've been watching, something that you've been focused on or. Not so much?
00:09:22.904 - 00:09:50.724, Speaker D: Right. So kind of the most unique thing that is available with the DAI stablecoin. So makers, stablecoin is the native yield it has. Right. You can get what's called a die savings rate. There's billions of dollars getting 8% on their cash all around the world, except for the US currently. So currently that's not available in the US, and that's because of that uncertainty towards crypto that exists in the US currently.
00:09:50.724 - 00:10:12.674, Speaker D: Right. It will be the same with Endgame. We're going to launch more yield features, and I think it's really exciting that there seems to be a sort of positive shift towards more clarity, more like, I don't like realism about the advantages and the potential of the industry. So I'm definitely. I mean, of course, it's America, right? Everyone's, everyone's watching, right, all over the world.
00:10:12.834 - 00:10:53.614, Speaker B: How have one of the pieces of us kind of legislation that I really did want to talk to you about on this show is the proposed legislation around stablecoins in the US, particularly the stablecoin build by Lummis and Gillibrand, was something that I wanted to talk with you about because there's quite a large section on it, specifically talking about algorithmic stablecoins, under which DAI would fall. Do you have any thoughts around the stablecoin legislation for algorithmic stablecoins in the US? But of course, more broadly, how do you think that those stable coins are going to be regulated? Should be regulated?
00:10:54.714 - 00:11:59.294, Speaker D: So I think that the most beneficial way to regulate crypto and DeFi is to really distinguish between basically decentralized projects and then ultimately companies that are delivering legal guarantees to the users. But on the other hand, I mean, it's going to be up to each individual jurisdiction. There's different jurisdictions. They have, they just have like, different fundamental approaches. And what we're trying to do in maker, and especially with, I mean, with Maker Endgame, with this renewed focus on the kind of the real, the core use case being having the stablecoin and then adding, like, sort of focusing on the fact that you can put the yield into the system natively without, like, without adding any additional risk. Our approach will basically be to sort of adapt to whatever the regulation is, whatever the like, whatever people want. We can sort of offer that, right? We can offer.
00:11:59.294 - 00:12:24.404, Speaker D: Is it just a yield component without a stablecoin component where you can sort of hide that away? Basically, that's a possibility. I mean, and there's already multiple jurisdictions where this might be a good solution in the end. I mean, of course, if you want what's best for the users, you should allow access to high quality, transparent, decentralized, resilient systems.
00:12:24.984 - 00:13:08.954, Speaker B: So I want to talk more about the end game, and I want to talk more about your thoughts on how this is going to work in different regulatory environments. So much of it's a very ambitious game plan. You've got new tokens, new daos, potentially new chain, a very ambitious overhaul to really how makerdao functions. A lot of it depends on the creation of sub daos. Given that daos are regulated very differently, even within the US, depending on what state you're in, how do you think that the endgame supports the creation of subdaos that may be operating in many different jurisdictions legally and regulatory wise? How does that work?
00:13:09.294 - 00:14:34.944, Speaker D: Well, so again, and like you said yourself, right, there's so much variation in how all the different, what do the different regulators want in different countries, in different states. And to sort of to generate the most value in that kind of environment, you have to be able to adapt, right? You have to be able to sort of understand what are the local conditions in a particular market and then approach it based on that. And that's actually like, that's really a key feature of the whole point of doing subtos, right, that they'll all have their own approaches to this. They'll have the ability to decide, do we want to bet on going in this particular market and then trying to figure out how to deal with the regulatory environment without it having to be some kind of huge sort of monolithic decision for the entire ecosystem to sort of bet on? We're going to do this country and that country, and, you know, we're not going to do that third one. The subdivisions can kind of do that individually. And then I think what's going to happen is, you know, as this shakes out and sort of increasingly more and more like, as we're already seeing the benefits of crypto become impossible to avoid, right? Impossible to ignore, it will eventually become more of like a real, you know, a real competition between jurisdictions to figure out how can they create, how can they take as much advantage of crypto, of Daos, of Defi, and generate value and be the place where the values is created?
00:14:35.564 - 00:15:09.854, Speaker C: Can I ask Ruhn, Dai is the original stablecoin on chain. Certainly. I mean, and you guys have gone through so many interesting eras. I remember in 2017 or 2018 and 19, you had to adjust the interest rates a bunch of times. DAi was struggling to stay pegged. It's been remarkably stable much later. What has driven that stability, leaving aside the March 2020, has it been the addition of many different types of collateral or what makes Dai have this, such longevity and still be successful after all these years?
00:15:10.514 - 00:15:49.778, Speaker D: Well, I guess at the very core level, it has been that our culture and our ethos from the beginning was always, we're making a stable coin. We're building stability. We don't want something that's fast and loose. It has to be. Actually, I guess you could say it's the, the saying that slow is fast, right? That we have just been sort of building core resilience. And then just sort of rolling it out and just keep scaling and growing. But then, specifically, why is it so stable now in terms of, like, the peg, that's definitely because of real world assets, right? So we really pioneered that in maker.
00:15:49.778 - 00:16:16.646, Speaker D: We were, I mean, grinding through that challenge for many, many years, not really figuring out how to do it. And then eventually we had the breakthrough. We were able to scale up treasuries, do things like real estate allocation. And today we have this, like, sort of best of both worlds, right? About 50% is crypto backed loans, currently paying pretty good yields. And then also just this, like, solid, so resilient base of treasuries, primarily of real assets.
00:16:16.710 - 00:17:00.544, Speaker C: And there's competition now. More, I would say more. So you had other algorithmic stable coins. I think of maker as a crypto collateralized stablecoin, although now a treasury collateral, an RWA collateralized. But you have these other projects now trying to do something similar, usually not in the United States, but past some of the yield that's generated by the underlying collateral, whether it's like there's mountain USDM and Athena, is a whole different thing that also passes something back. Is that competition something that is helping drive endgame or you and the Makerdao community's, you know, energy to evolve and grow maker, are you feeling that as competition?
00:17:00.924 - 00:17:49.984, Speaker D: I don't know. I mean, you could say, I think in Defi and crypto, a lot of things have this sort of, they're both competition, but they also synergize. And I think with in game, I mean, we're really, what we want to do is we want to focus on one particular approach that we think has a huge opportunity, and that is just making all of this stuff really easy to use, like, the most, like, the real sort of cutting edge, the advanced Defi stuff, the advanced RWA have all of that on the backend, but then make it super, super simple on the front. It's just a simple app. You can save your money, you can grow your money with the best yields. And we even have this, you know, this sort of secret ingredient of the subdao farming. Right? So you can get that unique only possible in crypto experience of actually farming different subped out tokens without, I mean, in a way that is still, you know, relatable to normal people.
00:17:49.984 - 00:18:12.904, Speaker D: You're not putting your. Your principle risk or it's, you know, like taking gambling or trading coins or something. Right. But it does feel a little bit like that. It gives you that kind of that experience. And I really think I mean, so because everything in crypto is kind of. It's both, it's competing, it's also synergizing and everything is kind of converging towards doing the same stuff.
00:18:12.904 - 00:19:15.304, Speaker D: Right. In Defi, like, you sort of have the same features, everything's open source, all the business models are transparent. The thing that's always going to set everything apart, that's going to determine everything is going to be brand, reputation, track record. That's like the stuff you can't copy, right? And so that's what we are sort of really focusing everything on, making it easy to use, focusing on the branding. We're rebranding as a part of Endgame all for the sake of just like streamlining all this end to end. And then with the subdaos you have something like Spark, which is one of the subdivisions that's running its own Defi protocol already the 9th biggest in the world, even though it hasn't even fully launched yet. But that's an example of how we can then sort of evolve the branding approach and sort of the how you can sort of in the same ecosystem, tapping into the same economies of scale, the same fundamental technical stack and track record, but kind of packaging that for different audiences so you can really make those more focused products that, you know, that really understand what's the market.
00:19:15.304 - 00:19:44.376, Speaker D: So for Spark, it's like, it's really like technical defi ogs, right? So let's, you know, let's make something that appeals to that, right? But in the future there will be things like gaming, right? If you're a gamer, you shouldn't. There's many things you don't care about, right? Let's only give you the things you care about. Or even like financial inclusion, like tether users make it super, super simple, right? Do not show any of the advanced stuff. Just give people a way to get yield on the tether and those kind of ideas, they're going to all be possible to do with subdaos.
00:19:44.520 - 00:20:17.526, Speaker B: Can you talk a little bit more about the launch process for Sparkdao? Because it is one of the first, the first subdaos that's going to be launching as part of this endgame. I think it's going to pave the way for maybe a lot of learnings for other subdivisions that will be created. Tell me a little bit about the launch process. What are some of the things that other subdows can kind of learn from? What are some of the mistakes or things that you think didn't go so well with the launch of Sparkdao? That you'd like to see iterated on for future subdivs to achieve this endgame vision.
00:20:17.710 - 00:20:58.804, Speaker D: Well, so, I mean, so we still haven't fully launched Spark yet in the sense that we do have the. We do have the core protocol live and it's been live for a year. And I mean, I think there was a. There's just, I mean, there's a. There's a lot of fundamental learnings around how to sort of go from the old school more like sort of slow moving Dao world into something that's faster with more like more space for innovation. But what's still coming as a part of what we call the launch season is the name for it. Right? So that's like our sequence of Endgame launch releases, basically, of where we actually are launching Endgame.
00:20:58.804 - 00:21:36.382, Speaker D: You know, we're launching our new app that with a focus on the user experience of being the best place to save and grow your money as long as you're not in the US until. Until things change. And then with that, the new brand. And then following that, we will then do the full launch of Sparkdao, which includes doing the Spark Airdrop. So that's at least something that's been, I think, been a major success. That before Spark launched there was this like pre farming sort of air trap that people have been able to get exposure to that. I mean, we're copying what everyone else has done.
00:21:36.382 - 00:22:06.130, Speaker D: I mean, we do kind of like to see what others are doing in the space, then try to make an even more sort of streamlined version of that. Then the most exciting moment will be when the spark token launches itself. The airdrop happens. Then we will open up for the ability to get the spark token as farming yield in the endgame app. So it's really easy to use, save and grow your money. You can get a cash yield like today, just click a button. No complicated user experience.
00:22:06.130 - 00:22:34.576, Speaker D: You don't have to be a genius to use this, but you can also get these exciting tokens starting with Spark and then just adding more subdivisions. And to your point, the goal will then be that every new subdao should just improve upon what's already there. Learn everything that went well and double down on that. Don't repeat the mistakes. Look at what it took us to set up Sparkdao and how the initial challenges of that and copy as much as possible and just focus on building on top of it.
00:22:34.720 - 00:23:50.490, Speaker B: Now you are pretty involved in the launch of this subdao, this the first one sparkdao. And of course in the initial stages of achieving this endgame vision. But of course, the goal later on is that, like you said, not everybody in the Makerdao community has to be involved in every single Sparkdao that's created, trying to decentralize and trying to grow the ethereum, sorry, not theory, the Bakerdao community to be a lot more scalable. I have to ask a little bit about the way governance works in a Dao and how the Makerdao governance process has evolved in pushing this endgame proposal through. I've seen on some of the websites, Makerdao actually has quite a few really great websites for tracking the activity in governance. And I've seen activity going down since the endgame proposal was first ratified through the Makerdao community. Does that concern you? Does the lack of participation in Dow governance concern you that the longevity and the sustainability of subdaos and sustainability of Dows will really be the way to make sure that Maker Dao stays, stays around for a long time? Tell me a little bit about how you've been reacting to that.
00:23:50.490 - 00:23:57.754, Speaker B: Is that a concern in review, the participation in governance and, yeah, token holder participation.
00:23:58.174 - 00:24:38.346, Speaker D: So the key problem in Dao governance is really, I mean, as it works, it's sort of the classic naive approach is signal to noise ratio. Right. So the problem is basically that when there's lots of activity in Daos, it's usually endless amounts of really bad proposals made by people that have something to gain from what, like the proposal they're pushing, right. Because you're asking people to do free work, so they're gonna, they're gonna do stuff that gives them some kind of benefit, otherwise they're not gonna put in the time. This is kind of the basic, basic problem of governance, right. I mean, when you ask people to vote, you're saying, yeah, work for free, make decisions for free. Right.
00:24:38.346 - 00:24:56.448, Speaker D: And it doesn't really, it doesn't really work if you don't make it simple and easy to do. Right. You gotta make it really, really simple, really, really streamlined. Right. The problem is, I mean, figuring out how to make it really simple and streamline that itself is a really, really huge challenge. Right. So that is one of the core pillars of Endgame, is trying to deal with this.
00:24:56.448 - 00:25:23.200, Speaker D: And we're doing that through a system we call the atlas, which is this. Basically, it's a system. I mean, really what it is is you can think of it as like a wisdom layer. Like wisdom, wisdom layer, right. Take the knowledge, take these. I mean, all of this stuff of like, what, how to do things like how to tell if a proposal is good, if it's bad, if someone doing work is worth it, right? Or if you shouldn't be paying this budget or you should. Or how to set risk parameters.
00:25:23.200 - 00:25:48.908, Speaker D: All these decisions, every time you do them, you sort of learn something from them. But usually in daos, then whoever learned that, then they leave and go somewhere else. And now you lost that knowledge again. And then someone new comes with some new random proposal and no one, like, the same mistakes are done over and over again. And we want to really, like, record that explicitly in text as this data that is easily accessible. You mentioned all the different front ends and different websites. We want to like.
00:25:48.908 - 00:26:29.154, Speaker D: I mean, as a part of the in game launch and the in game app, that's all going to be sort of converged into one single hub where you can get all the information from the atlas so you don't have to sort of chase it all over the place, right, which is. Which is good if you know how to do it. But if you're. If you don't have much time, if you're, you know, if you just want something that's easy, it's less great, right? And that's really, I mean, that's such a key thing to solve, to kind of make the part of the iceberg that's below the water make that actually work so that the symbol app that gives you a good yield, that lets you farm subdivision and, you know, the quality businesses, like, they're all tapping into this knowledge of how to make things work, how to make them safe.
00:26:29.234 - 00:26:52.698, Speaker B: And that wisdom layer is the AI layer of this endgame proposal, is that right engine or the technology that would be able to power and bring these things together for the benefit of decentralized governance, is that is the key technology there that you are envisioning and working towards and trying to research the AI piece or not so much?
00:26:52.826 - 00:27:30.626, Speaker D: I think you could say that. I think you could say the key pillar of atlas, right? So the wisdom layer, the place where all the knowledge is, I mean, you could say it's just, it's just structured data, right? So it's just like you want to put your data in a format that is sort of consistent and so you sort of know where it is and you know how to find it and you know how to put it in. And we're doing all that manually today. So the atlas already exists. The atlas, the sort of, the creation of the atlas was kind of the moment where endgame was approved. And endgame sort of runs on this atlas, which is a much more like sort of, yeah, information dense way to control the DAO. But AI is absolutely, and I mean, it is a key.
00:27:30.626 - 00:27:58.532, Speaker D: It is the key technology in scaling it up to a very large size. Right. Because as we're doing all these things, running tens or even hundreds of subdivs, it's going to become impossible for humans to sort of do all this and keep track of all of it. But AI is like the perfect mechanism to make that accessible. Right. So even if you're like a completely regular person, if you want to verify that it, the stable fund is safe and it's not gonna, you know, I'm not gonna lose my money. You should be like, AI can help you.
00:27:58.532 - 00:28:13.184, Speaker D: Sort of like, well, these are the rules, these are the guardrails, and this is how you verify whether they're being followed. And, you know, here you can go and check what the collateral is and you can see the treasuries and you can see the crypto loans. Like you can in theory do that today, but you have to be a bit of an expert to actually, you know, make it easy.
00:28:13.804 - 00:28:46.002, Speaker B: And one question that I have about the very practical kind of next steps for this endgame vision because as we are kind of nearing the end of our show, is of course we're looking forward to the next launch phases for Sparkdao. Definitely one of the subdows. But I have also been hearing some chatter on Twitter about expansion to l two s, L2 s. Can you talk a little bit about the L2 roll ups that you are evaluating or looking at for the next step in Makerdao's expansion and game plan?
00:28:46.118 - 00:29:22.606, Speaker D: Yeah, so the first thing that's coming in launch season when we start launching the in game products. So first we're doing the new app, you know, the best place to save and grow your money, get yield with a stablecoin and then basically, and with the new brand as well. So just like super easy to use, sort of the foundation for this. Then from there we will launch Spark within a few months from that. So the, so basically the first launch is coming in a few months. Spark will then follow in very few months, from there, one to two months. And yet to your point, it's going to be on L two.
00:29:22.606 - 00:29:49.206, Speaker D: So Spark in some, the launch of Spark is in some sense the really big launch in Endgame because I mean, it's the most anticipated, most exciting feature of Endgame. It's the first stop dial farming, is there? Yeah. The yield farming some, right. It's this unique use case only possible with, with defi. Right. And to really make that, open that up, make it scalable, it has to be on l two s. So it's really cheap to use.
00:29:49.206 - 00:29:55.254, Speaker D: Right. So anybody can, can use it. Right. And, yeah, we, I mean, I think we're, we're looking at the big three. L two s. The big three. Yeah.
00:29:55.254 - 00:29:58.974, Speaker D: Base optimism average from, well, very excited.
00:29:59.054 - 00:30:14.180, Speaker B: To see in the next couple months a lot of exciting things coming out from, from Makerdao, and we'll definitely continue to keep a really close eye on those developments. Thank you so much, Ruhn, for coming on the show and sharing more about the game vision. Thank you so much, Alex, for coming on the show.
