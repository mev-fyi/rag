00:00:00.320 - 00:00:21.486, Speaker A: Welcome to the special Galaxy Brain series. The Nashville tapes. Six recordings that we made on July 25 and 26th at the Music City center in Nashville, Tennessee during bitcoin 2024. It was an incredible conference. Multiple presidential candidates spoke. Ten sitting us senators came to bend the knee to bitcoin. We had a great time.
00:00:21.486 - 00:00:41.232, Speaker A: We have some great content coming up for you. Not on our regularly scheduled days. You're going to get these wham, bam, bam every day for the next week or so, and then we'll get back to our regularly scheduled galaxy brains programming. I hope you enjoy. Let's get to our first Nashville tape with Harry Sudok from grid. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:41.336 - 00:00:43.376, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash. Cash.
00:00:43.528 - 00:00:44.712, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thornton.
00:00:44.736 - 00:00:47.340, Speaker B: The us banking system is sound and resilient.
00:00:47.640 - 00:00:52.660, Speaker A: Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:52.960 - 00:01:03.868, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically. Go quieten. Be erased. Bitcoin is the best crypto. Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:01:04.044 - 00:01:31.724, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy brains. Next up in the Nashville tapes, I have a great interview with Harry Sudok, chief strategy officer of Grid, a good friend, one of the deepest voices in bitcoin, and one of the most powerful voices in bitcoin mining. Before we get to the show, I need to remind you, please refer to link to disclaimer in the podcast notes and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates of buyers sell any securities. Let's get right to the interview. Welcome Harry Sudok, chief strategy officer from Grid. My friend, welcome back to Galaxy Brands.
00:01:31.772 - 00:01:36.628, Speaker B: Thank you for having me in the great city of Nashville, in the great state of Tennessee.
00:01:36.724 - 00:01:41.940, Speaker A: Yes, it is a great state in a great city. And we're at the bitcoin conference. What are your first impressions?
00:01:42.100 - 00:02:00.494, Speaker B: My first impressions are that there is no medicine better than being around a room full of bitcoiners. The social capital, the financial capital, the collective mind share available to us at an event like this is just ridiculous. Yeah. And we managed to have fun doing it.
00:02:00.542 - 00:02:10.646, Speaker A: It is fun. And it has already been exciting. I mean, we're recording this on Thursday, what, the 26th? I think 25th. So it's industry day. It's the low key first day.
00:02:10.718 - 00:02:11.062, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:11.126 - 00:02:12.838, Speaker A: It's gonna get wacky.
00:02:13.014 - 00:02:30.780, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I'm of two minds. On the one hand, bitcoin is no longer like dark corner of the Internet idea. It's mainstream right? Which we all know all too well. But, like, the people, when you get 30,000 of us together, still are kind of dark corner of the Internet people.
00:02:31.400 - 00:02:43.392, Speaker A: Yeah. When you go walk around, it's like half, like business people and half, like, bearded, wizard looking people. And, I mean, you're like an energy guy. You look normal. Is that a compliment?
00:02:43.536 - 00:03:10.154, Speaker B: That's a compliment. I look normal. Thank you. Act a little less normal. If you ask my parents, when I decided to get into bitcoin mining as a profession, if this was a long term, sustainable career choice, they probably would have been more nervous than they should have been. But ultimately, I think that bitcoin's a big enough tent for all of us, so that's exciting and it is so.
00:03:10.242 - 00:03:20.806, Speaker A: Integral now to electrical grids. And I feel like the dam has broken. We last talked to you on Galaxy brains, like, July, but a year ago, I think July 23.
00:03:20.878 - 00:03:21.334, Speaker B: Yep.
00:03:21.422 - 00:03:36.182, Speaker A: And the heat hadn't really come down yet on this, you know, bitcoin's bad for the environment narrative. I feel like there's some nuance that has actually finally entered with Ercot's explanations about grid stability getting through. Have we moved?
00:03:36.246 - 00:04:21.090, Speaker B: Thank goodness the PhDs have arrived to explain it to all of us. No, I think the great news is every overnight success, it takes about ten years. And so we've been pounding the table to educate folks on why bitcoin mining is not a strain on electric systems, not on price, not on system engineering, not on peaks, you know? So the. The good news is the data's been on our side for about a decade, and finally we're having sort of our overnight success moment, which is that utilities are waking up to the fact that revenue is awesome and reliability is awesome, and everybody who makes up their constituencies are benefiting from the role that bitcoin miners have now been playing all across America and really globally.
00:04:21.170 - 00:04:51.558, Speaker A: Yeah. It's crazy to think that I've seen the projections for how much electricity is going to be needed in America, partly driven by data centers and obviously AI projections about AI, it's enormous. We're talking about doubling the total generation or something. And then when you think about, what are the critics of bitcoin mining on this issue, really? What are they really saying that they shouldn't, by the electricity, that it should just go generate it and not be used? Like, to be clear, right, they're not capable of using more electricity than is being generated.
00:04:51.694 - 00:05:42.854, Speaker B: No. And this is like the fundamental misnomer, which is that all of our electric systems need to be designed for like the 100, 200, 300 hours a year when the temperature massively drops or the temperature massively spikes. And the whole system needs to be designed around this very narrow window of time in the year. That leaves somewhere in the order of 8500 hours a year where that system is underutilized. So we, the bitcoin miners, you, the bitcoin miners, are all really excited to buy out all of that inventory that's essentially unusable. And when those 2300 hours a year come, when there's stress on the system, we are either directly incentivized or passively incentivized to give it back, which we do so happily. You know, I mentioned it in my talk from this morning, but, you know, the.
00:05:42.854 - 00:06:34.872, Speaker B: The technology is here, right? The ability to plug in an enormous amount of mining capacity already here, already proven, the ability to ramp that up and down with a high, high degree of specificity, that technology is already here. Yeah. The contract innovation of incentivizing us to do so on a real time basis, I think that's in some power markets, very mature, in other power markets, moderately mature, and then in some other power markets, nonexistent. And so there's this contractual innovation that's now lagging behind technical innovation. But ultimately, grids all over the US are benefiting from the role that bitcoin miners have happily been playing. And the good news is that we're able to generate more revenue for those power producers, that they then reinvest in their systems, increase reliability, increase generation like you described. And, you know, prosperity abounds.
00:06:34.936 - 00:06:49.728, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's very positive. Energy generation is very tied to prosperity. We've. I think our audience will be aware of that. What is it? There are no rich countries with low energy consumption or no poor countries with high energy generation.
00:06:49.784 - 00:06:49.976, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:50.008 - 00:06:51.528, Speaker A: Like, they don't exist directly correlated.
00:06:51.584 - 00:07:07.568, Speaker B: Right. So when you look at GDP per capita and megawatt hours per person, those are just this. It's the, you know, it's the meme from the office of. It's the same picture. Right. So there is no path to prosperity without high density electricity.
00:07:07.744 - 00:07:11.928, Speaker A: We're in Tennessee. The authority here is the Tennessee Valley Authority, right?
00:07:11.984 - 00:07:12.392, Speaker B: Yes, sir.
00:07:12.456 - 00:07:13.592, Speaker A: Largely nuclear.
00:07:13.736 - 00:07:18.080, Speaker B: The Tennessee Valley Authority is about 59% nuclear and hydroelectric.
00:07:18.120 - 00:07:20.424, Speaker A: There you go. It's the highest density energy we know of.
00:07:20.472 - 00:07:21.300, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:07:21.880 - 00:07:26.392, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on nuclear? Is the US going to figure this finally get out of its own way on nuclear?
00:07:26.496 - 00:08:00.138, Speaker B: Yeah. And same with bitcoin mining. The technology to deploy large scale nuclear capacity has been around since the sixties. And seventies. We need the political will. We need the social and community will to build these reactors to a, not shut off the existing reactors, b, extend the life of the existing reactors, c, expand the existing reactors, and d, build new smrs everywhere across America. If we're gonna go to the Valhalla of energy density, which we all believe we need get to.
00:08:00.194 - 00:08:18.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's no way that you can envision humanity as being wildly successful, you know, doing things like burning wood pellets and like. And even oil products. I mean, they're not bad. Natural gas is a pretty good source of electricity generation, but, gosh, it's multiple orders of magnitudes worse than nuclear.
00:08:19.082 - 00:09:03.670, Speaker B: And just think, you know, the thing we don't understand as a people about nuclear is that I'm able to amortize that reactor overdose 80 plus years on a useful life basis. No other technology do we believe is going to function as well as it functions today. 80 years in the future, only bitcoin and nuclear can have an 80 year vision into the future. And so we, as bitcoiners, are going to join hands with our brother and sister industries, really being the nuclear community, and build this thing out and deliver incredibly environmentally sound megawatt hours and be able to build the manufacturing capabilities, the production capabilities, the data center capabilities of the future. One town at a time.
00:09:03.750 - 00:09:09.278, Speaker A: I love that. Let's pivot a little bit. Harry, we are in Nashville. You've recently moved to Nashville?
00:09:09.334 - 00:09:09.854, Speaker B: Yes.
00:09:09.982 - 00:09:12.118, Speaker A: Because you are a partner at Bitcoin park.
00:09:12.254 - 00:09:12.758, Speaker B: Yes.
00:09:12.854 - 00:09:17.142, Speaker A: We've talked about Bitcoin park on this podcast before, but why don't you tell the audience about it and what it is?
00:09:17.246 - 00:09:32.176, Speaker B: Yeah. So I needed a second job. Like I needed the plague. But like any good bitcoiner, we bit off a little more and we could chew. Bitcoin park is a community space here in Nashville. We have a physical footprint. Alex is a generous member in our community.
00:09:32.176 - 00:09:54.636, Speaker B: It's just a member's club, basically, that hosts free and open events to the public to just work on bitcoin education every step of the way. I think one of the things that excites me a lot about Tennessee is that we are becoming. I hate this tech hub nomenclature, but it's starting to happen. The headquarters for Oracle is moving here, or maybe already has.
00:09:54.708 - 00:09:56.804, Speaker A: I saw lions. Bernstein moved their headquarters.
00:09:56.892 - 00:10:12.676, Speaker B: Bernstein moved their headquarters here. So, you know, the balkanization of the american state system continues in full force, especially here in Tennessee, where we've got. We're one of the triple net zero states, so no state income tax, no capital gains tax, and no dividend tax.
00:10:12.748 - 00:10:13.812, Speaker A: God, that sounds nice.
00:10:13.916 - 00:10:46.896, Speaker B: It is nice. And so we have this unique opportunity to recruit incredible established businesses, especially in the technology sector, because their employees lives will get better under a more business friendly regime. So I think we're flexing that recruiting muscle as a state. And more specifically, how do we power great businesses? We power them with great people. And so what bitcoin park is here to do is to create the bitcoin leg for all of these incredible people who are working in more traditional industry to kind of get their. Their spicy dose. It's bitcoin stuff.
00:10:46.968 - 00:11:07.836, Speaker A: It really is great. These third places, as we talk about them, right. The idea is like, you got home and work, but we really don't do well with third places in this country. It's not like in Europe where you go see people lounging around in the parks all the time. Central park in New York is a great third place. They obviously exist. I like to think of pub key as the bitcoin park of New York, Bitcoin park as the pub key of.
00:11:07.836 - 00:11:12.604, Speaker A: But these things work. Pub key of Nashville. Just shout out to our friends.
00:11:12.652 - 00:11:13.476, Speaker B: Our friend Thomas.
00:11:13.548 - 00:11:34.560, Speaker A: Yes, we love him, but it really is amazing. I mean, at Pub Key, at Bitcoin park, these are now congregation places. I mean, you go there and you see people, right? They're there, your friends are there. If you're in this, this is a movement not. It's not just a monetary system. It's truly a movement that is becoming physical.
00:11:35.020 - 00:12:26.668, Speaker B: I could not agree with this more, which is that, you know, we are social creatures, right? We crave community, and we crave interaction, especially when you mix that with an innovative new idea that bitcoin obviously represents. There's a huge cultural component to this whole thing that we're doing. And so being able to facilitate and enable that in a way where privacy is prioritized and the personal touch and feel of being in a small, close knit community can get fostered. Those are the things that we lost somewhere along the kind of brutalist architecture path. We're taking things back to a much more salon or renaissance age type of idea, and we just want to spend time with each other. And if we can do something at the park to facilitate that, that's our mission.
00:12:26.724 - 00:12:44.292, Speaker A: Yeah. Great events there. I've been to the Lightning summit, the mining summit, the Human Rights foundation global summit, and I didn't get to the noster one, but I wanted to. Very interesting in Nastr. You do anything in nastr? I'm still early on my learning curve of really understanding how interesting NaSTR could be, but, yeah.
00:12:44.316 - 00:13:18.202, Speaker B: So I'll give a huge shout out to the primal founder and CEO, Miliana. He's one of these absolute tour de force entrepreneurs in our industry who nobody knows enough about yet, but what primal is doing to make bitcoin and noster very, very easily accessible. Beautiful. Ux, they integrated a strike tie in on the back end, so they've got. They're basically, they're competing with social media and with Venmo at the same time. And it's really sleek and elegant. So I love their product.
00:13:18.202 - 00:13:44.698, Speaker B: That's how I interact with Noster. And I think that we obviously have seen the global censorship regime flex its muscles over the last 50 years. And so if we're able to bring the private key, public key cryptography tooling to more of our lives, we're going to become more sovereign, and then that will enable the real time social interactions to be more meaningful, and we're happier people.
00:13:44.874 - 00:13:50.970, Speaker A: So there was some big news for grid Harry, an acquisition. Tell us what happened.
00:13:51.050 - 00:14:24.206, Speaker B: Well, we didn't make it to our one year anniversary as a public company. We went public New Year's Eve, 2023, and we announced just last month that we're being acquired by Cleanspark. They've been phenomenal to work with. They understand our vision and our goals for the state of Tennessee. We're deeply culturally aligned around what bitcoin mining means to the world. And so it's really thrilling for us to be able to partner up with someone like them and start to tackle the growth of the future together. Yeah.
00:14:24.238 - 00:14:26.222, Speaker A: Big congratulations. I think it's really exciting.
00:14:26.286 - 00:14:26.950, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:14:27.070 - 00:14:36.534, Speaker A: And do you think we're going to see. Our mining team and other analysts have been predicting for, like, a year or two that we're going to enter a big era of M and A in mining.
00:14:36.582 - 00:14:36.742, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:36.766 - 00:14:46.350, Speaker A: It kind of only makes sense because scale is so important in mining. Do you think foresee more such transactions in mining's future?
00:14:46.890 - 00:15:28.694, Speaker B: I think that it's very likely that we see a large consolidation across the long tail. I think there's probably more 1510, 25 megawatt sites out there that are a little bit mom and pop, sole proprietor. Maybe they were high net into high net worth individual who kind of said, I'm going to put a mining business together. That made a ton of sense in 2018. It made a lot of sense in 2021. It makes less sense in 2024. And so there's going to be an opportunity for those folks to take what they built, which is a great business, and roll that into a larger scaled operator.
00:15:28.694 - 00:15:50.652, Speaker B: At this point, I think we're going to see a ton of that comes to the large scale. To large scale. I think that'll move a little more slowly. Obviously, there's lots of noise around the riot and bitfarm stuff. There's our deal. So I think there's certainly activity happening. Whether that all gets consummated or not is more of a question for me.
00:15:50.652 - 00:16:19.702, Speaker B: But I think everybody's thinking about kicking the tires on both ends. I think there's a lot of analogous behavior to, like, more of the spec oil stuff that's been out there. Everybody's a buyer and a seller. Everybody's looking, everybody's thinking about it. Everybody understands the economy's a scale or where you need to get to. And I think that that means there's going to be a lot of activity. But whether that gets carried through finish lines is still something I'm watching.
00:16:19.846 - 00:16:30.082, Speaker A: You know, I saw something crazy. I was just looking now 12% up expected next. Difficulty, adjustment. What's going on in hashrate right now is people adding a bunch of machines.
00:16:30.166 - 00:17:27.264, Speaker B: I mean, I just think efficiency is continuing to climb. At the end of the day, like, the number of joules required per terrahash hour is going down, and there's a lot of fleets that are due for upgrades. The price point for high efficiency machines is much lower than it has been in previous cycles. And so I think the decision to make a capital commitment to refreshing is pretty compelling. So I think the efficiency of the entire network is going to continue to fall, and that means hash rates going to continue to rise. But we are in a semi historic bear market for hash price, and I'm really curious to see what happens when price starts to run ahead of difficulty again, because we all know it's a large cyclical business cycle, and we're going to go through a period at some point in the future when bitcoin price and fees run ahead of this difficulty growth. And I think everybody's trying to get as big as they can in advance of that happening.
00:17:27.392 - 00:17:32.232, Speaker A: What's the historical significance of this year's bitcoin conference, Harry, being in Nashville and everything else going around it?
00:17:32.376 - 00:18:29.232, Speaker B: Bitcoin community of five to seven years ago would not believe what we're seeing from a public presence of our little Internet troll community. So it's super, super exciting that bitcoin A is being taken very, very seriously. We represent a rabid fan base who believes in a brighter future. And when you add the mixture of a hopeful, committed community who are also super high intelligence, super high work ethic, when you add that all together, you start to get to a place where there's a really, really motivated voter base. And so it's not a surprise to me that former President Trump is going to be here giving a speech over the weekend, because at the end of the day, we need to be courted. We're not courting them. They're courting us at this point.
00:18:29.232 - 00:18:36.704, Speaker B: And that's a big reversal from where we were certainly four years ago. But really, in bitcoin's entire history, we've never seen anything like this before.
00:18:36.792 - 00:18:51.144, Speaker A: Never. Okay, before we wrap, Harry, I wanted to ask you, you've got one of the best voices in bitcoin. I'm a big fan of deep voices. Thank you. I was thinking maybe we could go back and forth and do some ads for Nashville. For the park or for bitcoin.
00:18:51.232 - 00:18:51.784, Speaker B: I love it.
00:18:51.832 - 00:19:02.160, Speaker A: Conference. They can be funny. Welcome. Welcome to bitcoin 2024, where the men's, the line for the men's room is longer than the line for the women's room.
00:19:03.500 - 00:19:20.040, Speaker B: You find yourself here in Nashville, you walk off the plane, you check into your hotel, you wake up in the morning, you fire up that coffee, you roll into Bitcoin magazine 2024, bitcoin event or the Republican National Convention 2.0?
00:19:20.580 - 00:19:21.876, Speaker A: Which one is it?
00:19:22.068 - 00:19:24.236, Speaker B: The world may never know.
00:19:24.428 - 00:19:27.620, Speaker A: Welcome to Nashville, the home of bitcoin.
00:19:28.280 - 00:19:32.680, Speaker B: We're going to make bitcoin and bitcoin mining great again.
00:19:32.840 - 00:19:44.816, Speaker A: Make it great again. It always was, never has been. My friend, Harry Sudok from grid. Congrats on recent awesome stuff with grid, and it's always great to have you here, my friend. Good to see you, Alex.
00:19:44.888 - 00:19:49.968, Speaker B: I'll spend time with you anytime, any place, any city, and have a good time doing it.
00:19:50.024 - 00:19:51.080, Speaker A: Thank you, Harry. Good to see you.
00:19:51.120 - 00:19:52.110, Speaker B: Likewise. Brotherhood.
