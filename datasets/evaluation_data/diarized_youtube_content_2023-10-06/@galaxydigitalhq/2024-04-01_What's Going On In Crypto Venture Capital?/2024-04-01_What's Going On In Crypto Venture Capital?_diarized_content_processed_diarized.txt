00:00:00.640 - 00:00:06.046, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, will Nelly, general partner at Galaxy Ventures. Welcome to Galaxy Brands, Will.
00:00:06.150 - 00:00:09.982, Speaker B: Thank you, Alex. It's been a long time coming. We've been trying to make this happen for a little bit.
00:00:10.038 - 00:00:38.070, Speaker A: It has. So when I joined Galaxy Will, it was very clear to me that Will was one of the smartest people on blockchain technology that I had met. And it's only been further proven true. And we have some interesting, slightly esoteric topics for those interested in blockchain technology. Luckily, I know our audience is that I wanted to dig in with Will. But first, I want to ask you just what's going on in venture right now? It's Q 120 24. Obviously, bitcoin is up.
00:00:38.070 - 00:00:51.974, Speaker A: The liquid assets are ripping. But venture, as of the data we published at the end of Q four, was still making in new lows and deals. Maybe that will change when we refresh the data. But what are the vibes out here? Are you guys very busy all of a sudden, or more busy than last year?
