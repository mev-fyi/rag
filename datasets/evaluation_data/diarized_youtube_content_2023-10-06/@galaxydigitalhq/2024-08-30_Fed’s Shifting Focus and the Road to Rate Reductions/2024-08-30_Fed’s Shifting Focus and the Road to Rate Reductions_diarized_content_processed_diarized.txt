00:00:07.440 - 00:00:12.161, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bibnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bibnet, welcome to Galaxy Brands.
00:00:12.233 - 00:00:13.365, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.665 - 00:00:37.725, Speaker A: We had some interesting stuff has been happening. I guess that's no surprise. Markets are always interesting. But in Jackson Hole last week, the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell gave a speech. He seemed to very clearly confirm that the Fed is now more focused on its employment mandate than worried about combating inflation, which seemed like a green light now for rate cuts.
00:00:38.025 - 00:01:35.085, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. He basically reinforced the expectations for the Fed to cut pretty aggressively over the course of the next year. You had Fixed Income rally on the back of his speech, dollar sell off. And so I think none of what he said really came as a surprise to the market. And in all honesty, you're basically at the point where the Fed recognizes the fact that monetary policy has been restrictive for a long period of time and that restrictiveness is beginning to impact the labor market. In addition, that restrictiveness may not be warranted with respect to the price level or the rate of change of the price level. And so with that in mind, you probably need to be at neutral sooner rather than later.
00:01:35.085 - 00:02:06.075, Speaker B: And what's neutral? Well, let's say 2.5% is neutral. So one could argue that you are almost 300 basis points away from being at a neutral level of interest rates. And we define a neutral level of interest rates as a level of interest rates that neither encourages more economic activity nor discourages it from an aggregate demand and supply standpoint. And so that happy equilibrium place.
00:02:07.735 - 00:02:11.431, Speaker A: So we're 300 basis points above that right now.
00:02:11.503 - 00:02:11.951, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:12.063 - 00:02:15.215, Speaker A: And so that's theoretically 12 cuts, quote, unquote.
00:02:15.375 - 00:02:15.909, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:16.007 - 00:02:18.425, Speaker A: So that's a fairly large amount of cutting from where we are.
00:02:18.465 - 00:02:27.725, Speaker B: Yeah, one could argue that that's where we need to be. The other argument, though, is the neutral rate is now higher, and so is neutral three, three and a half.
00:02:28.025 - 00:02:33.993, Speaker A: But they don't actually have to decide that yet. They can start cutting, and then the question is, where do they stop cutting to decide that? Correct.
00:02:34.089 - 00:02:36.521, Speaker B: And the question is at what pace should they cut?
00:02:36.593 - 00:02:56.843, Speaker A: But either. Okay, so pace is the magnitude of each cut, but do we expect. And I think I've looked at this chart. You know, historically, when they start a cutting cycle or regime, it's a little staircase, right? They start, they take off either 25 or 50 or some amount, normally 50, basically every time until they get to where they want.
00:02:56.939 - 00:03:00.963, Speaker B: Or it's a dramatic situation and it's like emergency cut, like 100 basis points.
00:03:00.979 - 00:03:10.155, Speaker A: But we don't think we're there. Right. So we're likely to see either 25 or 50bps cuts multiple times in a row starting in September. That's what the market basically thinks of.
00:03:10.195 - 00:03:18.854, Speaker B: So you now have 100 basis points priced in for the next three meetings. So that's a little over 25 per meeting. Yeah.
00:03:18.934 - 00:03:22.283, Speaker A: So that's like 150 and 225s or something is the expectation.
00:03:22.339 - 00:03:32.779, Speaker B: And then you have about 195 basis points out to the June 15th meeting in 2025. So that's a lot of cutting.
00:03:32.827 - 00:03:33.587, Speaker A: Yep.
00:03:33.771 - 00:03:37.203, Speaker B: Basically just going in 25 every single time. Yes.
00:03:37.259 - 00:03:41.473, Speaker A: Yeah. So it is. It's the play. The expectation is the staircase down, basically. Yeah.
00:03:41.579 - 00:03:44.437, Speaker B: But that's absent any kind of like shocks.
00:03:44.501 - 00:03:46.925, Speaker A: Totally. They could pause or do more. Right.
00:03:46.965 - 00:03:56.045, Speaker B: Yeah. And in theory, it's like if you start to see the unemployment rate ticking meaningfully higher, you cut faster. You should cut faster.
00:03:56.085 - 00:03:56.705, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:57.045 - 00:04:03.981, Speaker B: And there's nothing to tell you that like you shouldn't because the price pressures have gone away. Right, right.
00:04:04.053 - 00:04:07.133, Speaker A: If inflation stays down, may as well come down.
00:04:07.189 - 00:04:25.517, Speaker B: May as well come down. I mean, the cost of goods have been coming down. You know, oil's had some rebounds because of, you know, geopolitical risks, et cetera, but that's broadly been coming down. The supply side stuff as a function of COVID has completely abated.
00:04:25.621 - 00:04:30.365, Speaker A: Okay. So there's no longer the lines of like, you know, millions of truckers unable to get into the port and stuff.
00:04:30.445 - 00:04:30.773, Speaker B: Correct.
00:04:30.829 - 00:04:32.725, Speaker A: The logistics have eased.
00:04:32.845 - 00:04:44.175, Speaker B: Totally eased, fully normalized. And where we've seen the most kind of pressure has been in the services and housing. And, you know, you're starting to see some cooling there.
00:04:44.255 - 00:04:56.887, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think what's gonna happen? What is the expectation for the housing market? Excuse me? If rates come down, I mean. Right. Presumably the cost of mortgages comes down. Right.
00:04:56.951 - 00:04:59.647, Speaker B: But housing affordability will improve, but won't it?
00:04:59.671 - 00:05:00.915, Speaker A: In theory, yes.
00:05:01.335 - 00:05:16.199, Speaker B: However, it's a little bit trickier. One, it's. Real estate is very local, so it's dependent on what market you're in. If you're in Austin, Texas these days, it's not so good. And even if the buyer's market down there.
00:05:16.247 - 00:05:16.551, Speaker A: Yes.
00:05:16.623 - 00:05:31.459, Speaker B: Even if the mortgage rates come down, it's not gonna impact things too much. And then if you're in an area where the supply of homes is still super tight, then the prices of homes might not.
00:05:31.567 - 00:05:49.123, Speaker A: The mortgage. Yeah, the borrow costs might come down, but the. But the prices may not and the competition may not because that's one of the other things. I mean this is just purely. I'm total layman when it comes to the housing market. But if the cost to borrow is reduced, theoretically more buyers show up. Right.
00:05:49.179 - 00:05:56.739, Speaker B: And that could prices. But in theory that also means that more supply could come on because folks feel comfortable.
00:05:56.867 - 00:06:00.203, Speaker A: If there are more buyers, then you start to get more building as well.
00:06:00.259 - 00:06:12.659, Speaker B: Well, the build. The building's happening. That, that's part of it. But there's been a lot of folks that are trapped in their homes because the, you know, when you're stuck in a home, that's because it's the 3%.
00:06:12.707 - 00:06:16.707, Speaker A: Right. Because the values of homes have remained stubbornly high.
00:06:16.811 - 00:06:17.475, Speaker B: Nobody wants to.
00:06:17.515 - 00:06:26.555, Speaker A: But the turnover is very low. Right. Like so people aren't actually. You've got a very valuable asset on paper that you can't actually unload because they're correct. The market's not very vibrant because there aren't enough buyers.
00:06:26.595 - 00:06:30.435, Speaker B: Yeah. And the only way to unload it is to take a home equity line. Really.
00:06:30.515 - 00:06:30.803, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:30.859 - 00:06:33.147, Speaker B: Right. And those rates are really high.
00:06:33.211 - 00:06:33.819, Speaker A: Right, right, right.
00:06:33.867 - 00:06:36.067, Speaker B: And so you'll have probably more of both.
00:06:36.131 - 00:06:53.935, Speaker A: So you would say just on net, and I think this might be common sense and knowledge, but just you're an actual smart economic person on net. Lowering the rates here will help the housing market. It'll increase turnover and volumes and get it hopping a bit more again. Whereas right now it's kind of frozen.
00:06:54.655 - 00:06:56.807, Speaker B: I wouldn't call it frozen, but yes.
00:06:56.871 - 00:06:57.471, Speaker A: Sticky.
00:06:57.583 - 00:07:07.567, Speaker B: Yes. So I mean there's dueling things. But again, the focus of the market and the focus of the Fed is really on the employment picture.
00:07:07.631 - 00:07:08.087, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:08.191 - 00:08:11.601, Speaker B: And you had a July non farm payrolls print that was below trend and you've had wage pressures that are subsiding and looking ahead basically all of next week. You just keep getting more and more labor data. On Wednesday, you've got adp, you've got ISM services, which also have an employment component. You have the job opening figures, jolts that are also released next week in addition to August non farm payrolls. The market will have plenty of information about the current state of the labor market basically by the end of next week. And I think expectations have come off a lot. And if you start to see a more rapid deterioration in the labor market, that's when the Fed will probably be forced to aggress in terms of the magnitude of the cuts.
00:08:11.713 - 00:08:16.523, Speaker A: All right, so that would be broadly speaking supportive for risk. Right. Lower rates.
00:08:16.579 - 00:08:21.619, Speaker B: It's really tough to say. I will tell You, I will tell.
00:08:21.627 - 00:08:24.051, Speaker A: You equities are like still pretty much at all time highs.
00:08:24.123 - 00:08:24.451, Speaker B: Correct.
00:08:24.523 - 00:08:26.811, Speaker A: So I guess how much more support do we need?
00:08:26.963 - 00:09:12.641, Speaker B: Yes, I would say the most direct impact is in interest rates and currencies. The dollar has been on the back foot basically since Jackson Hole and a bit before as well. Cable being a really strong outperformer and Euro I think got up to as high as 112 and stuff. Then the BOJ move obviously took $YEN from 160s to the low 140s and stuff. You've had a dollar which in all essence is just a function of relative rates and stuff move with the front end pricing. Those I would say are the two markets most directly impacted. On the equity side if the employment picture is getting worse and if the Fed is responding to a worsening employment picture, like that's bad news.
00:09:12.641 - 00:09:28.849, Speaker B: Is bad news. Yeah, right. Like people will spend less on discretionary items. Like consumer discretionary companies are already not doing well. Just look at some of these like. Yeah, yeah, high flying like fashion brands and the other consumer thing.
00:09:28.897 - 00:09:32.225, Speaker A: Right. I saw something about luxury watches not doing well. In fact some newspaper.
00:09:32.305 - 00:09:32.681, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:32.753 - 00:09:35.925, Speaker A: Threatened to blame crypto for that. But no, it's possible.
00:09:36.425 - 00:10:34.989, Speaker B: But, but, but you are seeing you know, folks pinching their belts and wallets and so that has a multiplier effect on the economy. At the same time, while companies can now finance debt at cheaper levels, bad companies that have a lot of debt maturing in the next year or two will be able to refinance at lower rates if you take the lot of earnings are also outside of the U.S. and so if you see a material depreciation in the dollar, they'll actually bring back more revenues to US companies to the tune of about an extra 2% or something to EPS based on the magnitude of this move. So there are parts of the rate move that will help companies. But bad news is bad news when you're at all time highs already.
00:10:35.037 - 00:10:58.528, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair. All right, real quick, let's talk about crypto market because over the weekend actually we were running pretty high. We'll stick to bitcoin here. Bitcoin ran about as high as almost 65k. I think maybe 65k was the high. Yeah, yeah. And it was doing fine, chugging along and then basically on Monday really broke, started to break down and as we talk now we're about 59k.
00:10:58.528 - 00:11:19.585, Speaker A: I saw this go as low as about 58k again. Shout out Bitcoin. 58k gang, why this on the back of a weak dollar, theoretically at least constructive, fed to something like bitcoin. What's going on here with the corn? And obviously others performed even worse.
00:11:20.205 - 00:11:36.841, Speaker B: Yeah. So you had a short squeeze that got you up to 65k and then you had some natural profit taking in BTC. It's also worth keeping in mind that basically a month ago we were at 50k. So there's a lot of buyers that were totally heavily in the money.
00:11:36.913 - 00:11:41.713, Speaker A: Right, 50. You buy it at the 59, 50 low, sell it 65. That's a nice move.
00:11:41.769 - 00:12:15.023, Speaker B: That's a nice move in a month to capture. Yeah. And so folks have done real well and then you know, you had, you still have GOX distributions that are ongoing and basically what happened yesterday was, you know, in the afternoon, it's literally the last week of August, lots of folks off desk in. I want to say I read some stat that this week we had probably one of the most illiquid weeks in the S and P. Like in terms of volume wise, like what ever. Like this year.
00:12:15.079 - 00:12:15.675, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:16.215 - 00:12:46.719, Speaker B: And so it really wasn't a liquid period. And so you had a sell off that got exacerbated by liquidations into low liquidity, into dealers that were basically short about 20 million bucks a gamma at the 60k price point. And so you had 2 billion of OI wiped out and short gamma positioning and GOX distributions into probably one of the most liquid periods of the day and year.
00:12:46.807 - 00:13:22.101, Speaker A: Yep. Makes sense. Technical, some overhang. I mean the GOX distributions you're talking about are from the distributors to their end users and clients because we've seen, I think what we expect is, and again we don't know, but we expect from the GOX estate that all has been distributed now. But of course that's getting sent to Kraken, Bitco, bitstamp, whomever over the last month and a half and at some point they actually give those coins to people. But otherwise it sounds like I'm mostly hearing like you know, a move, a technical move, a profit taking move exacerbated by market structure. Nothing.
00:13:22.101 - 00:13:23.917, Speaker A: It doesn't feel like panic out there, does it?
00:13:23.981 - 00:13:37.741, Speaker B: Does not. But I will say that it is. Concerning the decoupling from macro that you've had, you're talking about a dollar that's been super heavy over the past couple.
00:13:37.773 - 00:13:40.261, Speaker A: Of weeks, which has usually been constructive for Bitcoin.
00:13:40.373 - 00:13:42.205, Speaker B: But just think about gold, right?
00:13:42.245 - 00:13:42.825, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:43.125 - 00:13:45.781, Speaker B: All time highs, all time. It's off a little bit today.
00:13:45.813 - 00:13:47.733, Speaker A: Yeah. Over the last couple of weeks.
00:13:47.829 - 00:14:03.257, Speaker B: Yeah. You're trading at all time highs in the biggest monetary debasement hedge in markets in human history. And then equities have obviously S and P was within spitting distance of fresh all time high.
00:14:03.281 - 00:14:05.905, Speaker A: I think one of them, I can't remember it might have even been the Dow.
00:14:05.945 - 00:14:07.785, Speaker B: But one of Dow hit an all time high yesterday.
00:14:07.905 - 00:14:09.681, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the intraday all time high.
00:14:09.753 - 00:14:32.155, Speaker B: Yeah. And so it is concerning that we've decoupled so much from traditional markets. And I'd say the other concerning part is just one of the reasons that people like crypto and like bitcoin is because of the upward price moves for sure. Number go up. Number go up.
00:14:32.195 - 00:14:33.851, Speaker A: The best advertising that you've got.
00:14:33.963 - 00:14:48.237, Speaker B: Yeah. And so when you lose that and you don't really have a catalyst outside of Trump starting to do better in the presidential debates and polling, it does kind of leave you with being like.
00:14:48.341 - 00:14:49.085, Speaker A: Where do we go from here?
00:14:49.125 - 00:14:53.589, Speaker B: Where do we go from here? But there's a lot on the horizon over the six months.
00:14:53.637 - 00:15:00.061, Speaker A: Well, we're going to get into that on next week's show because I want to thank you, Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading for coming on Galaxy Brands.
00:15:00.133 - 00:15:00.845, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
