Did you know that the kids are dropping USD? Watch a bitch of Todd stretches swapping TLC plant a message deep down like a seed and I'm colder than the storage that keeps my money free as always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head.
00:00:51.728 - 00:00:53.462, Speaker B: Of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital.
00:00:53.526 - 00:00:55.498, Speaker A: Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:55.594 - 00:00:57.294, Speaker B: We have a great show for you today.
00:00:57.412 - 00:01:14.594, Speaker A: As I said, tony Kai, founder of Atomic Finance, is our guest. We'll talk with Tony about building Defi on bitcoin. It's a fascinating conversation. And of course, we'll check in with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets. But before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer.
00:01:14.632 - 00:01:16.898, Speaker B: To the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of.

00:01:22.572 - 00:01:40.634, Speaker B: Affiliates to buy or sell any securities. I just have to follow up. We're watching the Sam Bakeman free trial. And Finn, did you see that? Caroline Ellison, his, I guess they say, on and off again, girlfriend, but also.
00:01:40.672 - 00:01:42.026, Speaker A: The former CEO of Alameda.
00:01:42.058 - 00:01:46.718, Speaker B: She was asked what Sam's ambitions were. Did you see that?
00:01:46.804 - 00:01:59.282, Speaker C: Well, we've been waiting for this moment, right? This is like a critical element to this case, and her participation is know the make or break. I mean, the whole case is make.
00:01:59.336 - 00:01:59.874, Speaker B: I agree.
00:01:59.992 - 00:02:01.170, Speaker C: Slam dunk. You think?
00:02:01.240 - 00:02:03.470, Speaker B: But, yeah, she is a key witness.
00:02:03.550 - 00:02:03.938, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:02:04.024 - 00:02:11.010, Speaker B: For the prosecution. She was there. They not only worked together and she was a top lieutenant, but they dated.
00:02:11.090 - 00:02:11.334, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:11.372 - 00:02:14.242, Speaker B: And, in fact, lived together, she said, under testimony.
00:02:14.306 - 00:02:20.682, Speaker C: And she took the stand. And as an avid follower of the transcripts in the courtroom, do you want to tell us some of your.
00:02:20.736 - 00:02:33.760, Speaker B: Well, so she said, they asked her what Sam's ambitions were, and she said, to be president and the prosecutor said, president of what? And she said the.
00:02:35.970 - 00:02:43.860, Speaker C: You know, can you imagine we're learning so much about the personality behind.
00:02:47.430 - 00:03:05.990, Speaker B: I agree. He is some kind of hyper ambitious but also introverted kind of guy, clearly delusional. I mean, president of the United States. This guy appeared in Congress well before the collapse of FTX. He couldn'tie his shoes. There was famous picture of his shoes. They were like a rat's nest.
00:03:05.990 - 00:03:08.610, Speaker B: I don't think you can be president if you can'tie shoes.
00:03:08.690 - 00:03:18.860, Speaker C: And as your producer before the show today, I said, do you think there's value in us addressing, are you addressing the implications for the crypto markets or the landscape of the industry? And you were kind of like.
00:03:20.590 - 00:03:20.918, Speaker D: We'Ve.
00:03:20.934 - 00:03:31.258, Speaker C: Been there, done that a little bit. And this is now just sort of a story about this case, and it's not as relevant to the world of cryptocurrency markets.
00:03:31.354 - 00:04:07.530, Speaker B: I've really yet to see anything come out so far in the case that is market impactful at this point. I mean, right? The market really fully deleveraged off FTX's collapse over the last year. So one more thing that I wanted to read. The prosecutor said to Caroline, he said, why did you break up? And Ellison said, well, he wasn't spending much time with me. The prosecutor says, was it secret? I think, meaning the relationship. And Ellison said, at first, then he told me we could say we were living together, but no more. Then they immediately asked, what was your salary? Caroline says 200,000.
00:04:07.530 - 00:04:20.030, Speaker B: Then a bonus in 2021 of 20 million. Must be nice. By the way, I'm pretty sure that 20 million, like, basically everything that FTX did came from client accounts.
00:04:20.850 - 00:04:21.614, Speaker C: So there you go.
00:04:21.652 - 00:04:23.422, Speaker B: Not great, not great, not great.
00:04:23.476 - 00:04:23.854, Speaker D: All right.
00:04:23.892 - 00:04:44.950, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for listening to galaxy brains, as always. Everyone, let's jump right into it with BiMnet. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains. Thanks for having mean. Bitcoin and ETH are not doing great. We'll talk a little bit about any effect that we've seen from the attack on Israel.
00:04:44.950 - 00:04:49.002, Speaker B: But what is the status of markets in your view? Right now?
00:04:49.136 - 00:05:35.138, Speaker E: Crypto markets trade heavy right now. There is a very distinct sort of dislike or lack of favorability for ETH. Right now, ETH BTC is down pretty meaningfully over the past month, around 10%. Some of it has been because the FTX exploiter has been t whopping some ETH. But I generally think it has to do with the fundamental case for ETH as well, the lack of follow through on the ETH futures product, in addition to a lack of any meaningful positive catalysts in ETH. In addition, you have competitors and l, two tokens, et cetera. And I like to think that, I think bitcoin's got a great story and it's going to outperform.
00:05:35.138 - 00:06:15.986, Speaker E: It's going to be one of the better outperformers this year if you get an ETF or going into q one. And so just on a relative basis, it doesn't seem that compelling. And then with broader markets, the main concerns were obviously around the events of the weekend in Israel. The immediate reaction was oil jumped from $82 a barrel to 86, and you had some correction in equities. And we've eventually bounced back. And then ultimately it's led to a little bit of a risk off move in treasuries, and we've caught a bid. And that relief in treasuries has helped generally support price action in equities, which.
00:06:16.008 - 00:06:19.134, Speaker B: Is like the opposite of historically how it typically would be.
00:06:19.192 - 00:06:30.070, Speaker E: And so now I think we go back to what was originally driving markets, which was this price action in bonds, and you've got a really important data point tomorrow in CPI.
00:06:30.150 - 00:06:30.634, Speaker D: Right.
00:06:30.752 - 00:07:10.790, Speaker E: And so I think if you get a soft number, you'll see continued relief in bonds and that should cause equities to rally high level, though. I think you're just at such a weird place in markets. The part of me is like, oh my God, there are so many things cracking. Look at credit card delinquencies, auto delinquencies, look at the number of people that have part time work. Look at wage growth coming in a little bit lower. There's so many signs in the economy that we're rolling over a little bit. However, the structural things just have not changed in the economy.
00:07:10.790 - 00:07:51.374, Speaker E: There's going to be tons of bond supply and the government is probably going to spend 6% of GDP on their deficit in perpetuity. The labor market is still tight in terms of there's still huge mismatches among skills and labor. In addition, there's like 9 million job openings already. We just had a huge surprise in jolts. And so there are signs that support both arguments. And ultimately I find myself in the camp of the curve has got to steepen. If you think that the economy is going to slow down, then the Fed's likely going to cut more and you'll get more cut pricing.
00:07:51.374 - 00:08:42.258, Speaker E: That should mean that twos rally and you still have tons of long end supply and so the curve steepens if you think we go higher in rates because the economy is really strong. The Fed came out this week and told you that moves in the back or effectively tighten financial conditions to the same extent that a rise in front end interest rate does. And so it seems like if rates are going to go higher in general, we're going to get a bear steepening of the curve. And if rates are going to go lower, you're going to get a bull or bull bear steepening of the curve. So either or, it kind of seems like you're set up for steepening. And that's kind of my bias at the moment. But it's really tricky, especially now that you've thrown in a geopolitical conflict on top of that.
00:08:42.258 - 00:09:40.434, Speaker E: In addition, I think the Fed's making it up as they go, just responding to these data points and stuff and the fact that they felt obligated enough to have five Fed speakers comment on the extent of the back end selling off when it's totally justified. And when you're still hiking, you're still telling the world that you might need to hike, you might need to take rates more financial condition more restrictive, and yet you feel the need to comment that it might not justify hiking in the front end. It's so messed up. And part of the interpretation of why back end yields have risen is because some market participants view the current Fed as one not willing to fight the most important battle with inflation, which is the last mile.
00:09:40.562 - 00:09:40.902, Speaker D: Right.
00:09:40.956 - 00:10:10.110, Speaker E: If the Fed right now is like, oh, we're close to done, and they're not showing that vigor to really stamp out inflation, right, then that means inflation is going to be an issue in the longer run, right? Potentially. And so I think that that's kind of interesting, a reason for some of the sell off in the curve, because market participant, like the whole ten year paper or 30 year paper, you need to be confident that you're getting real returns that are meaningful.
00:10:11.490 - 00:10:15.474, Speaker B: So people are doubting the Fed's resolve here as we're in this, like I am.
00:10:15.512 - 00:10:15.810, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:10:15.880 - 00:10:29.326, Speaker B: And we're in this hike pause hike regime right now, where they're sort of, sort of sputtering along, kind of signaling there might be close to done. And yet inflation is still elevated, although that's why you're saying big number tomorrow.
00:10:29.358 - 00:10:55.994, Speaker E: To see what CPI, and it's also, I mean, we've had this discussion before, but what people still fail to realize is the Fed is going to claim victory over getting the rate of price changes to a reasonable level right. So that the price increases are somewhat more manageable. It does not address the fact that certain aspects of the economy and certain price levels have gotten to astronomical levels.
00:10:56.042 - 00:10:56.542, Speaker D: Right.
00:10:56.676 - 00:11:08.050, Speaker E: So if rent in New York or in anywhere goes from $1,500 to 3000, rent doubled. Right. And then starts going from 3000 to 3100.
00:11:08.120 - 00:11:08.450, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:08.520 - 00:11:09.474, Speaker B: That's a win in their mind.
00:11:09.512 - 00:11:30.690, Speaker E: That's a win in their mind. But it is absolutely nonsensical because the real incomes haven't actually kept up for those price levels. And so you're just in such a weird situation. And the Fed's going to be quick to declare victory because they have a huge issue, which is 6% of GDP going towards deficits.
00:11:30.770 - 00:11:30.966, Speaker D: Right.
00:11:30.988 - 00:11:33.946, Speaker B: They've got to lower those rates as soon as they can, basically.
00:11:34.048 - 00:11:34.362, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:34.416 - 00:11:40.186, Speaker B: Because, well, they can't keep them higher for longer. They just can't. The government will essentially bankrupt itself or.
00:11:40.208 - 00:11:50.174, Speaker E: The Fed's going to have to just start accumulating, buying the bonds. And so it's such a weird situation. Like what is victory? What does victory look like?
00:11:50.212 - 00:11:57.102, Speaker B: We've talked about this before too, about how a decline in inflation actually means a slowing of the growth rate of inflation.
00:11:57.166 - 00:11:57.538, Speaker E: Correct.
00:11:57.624 - 00:12:09.134, Speaker B: Versus, it doesn't mean things go back to the way they were. Inflation. I'm thinking about that video, that great video of quantitative easing explained from Omid Malaikon where they're saying, but isn't the price of milk higher than a year ago?
00:12:09.192 - 00:12:09.510, Speaker D: Yes.
00:12:09.580 - 00:12:11.622, Speaker B: Isn't the price of airlines higher than a year ago?
00:12:11.676 - 00:12:12.642, Speaker E: Orange juice prices?
00:12:12.706 - 00:12:23.914, Speaker B: Exactly. And airlines too, just recently too. I know the last couple of cpIs, they were elevated a component. And I'm seeing that as too, as I travel, prices are almost double from where they were six months ago for.
00:12:23.952 - 00:12:37.146, Speaker E: Basic, this is another debate, but are we even measuring the right things? Do they capture the, is the CPI basket really indicative of what people actually spend money on?
00:12:37.168 - 00:12:49.326, Speaker B: You see people, there was a video that was going viral from TikTok. I saw it like downstream of TikTok on Twitter or X.com. And it's a guy going around Costco comparing all the prices, being like, dude, these are ridiculous.
00:12:49.438 - 00:12:49.714, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:12:49.752 - 00:12:51.122, Speaker E: Way higher than they were.
00:12:51.256 - 00:12:59.746, Speaker B: And not like three, 4%, 5%, like 20%, 50% higher. And this is, Costco is a large wholesale. Right.
00:12:59.848 - 00:13:00.806, Speaker E: They got the best price.
00:13:00.908 - 00:13:01.560, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:13:02.250 - 00:13:05.158, Speaker B: That hot dog. I don't know how they keep that hot dog. Buck 50 though.
00:13:05.244 - 00:13:06.934, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's Buck 99.
00:13:06.972 - 00:13:12.602, Speaker B: But did they raise it? No, I think it was a buck 50. I'm not sure. But it's been flat for like decades anyway.
00:13:12.656 - 00:13:13.162, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:13:13.296 - 00:13:14.522, Speaker B: It's a tricky situation.
00:13:14.656 - 00:13:15.334, Speaker D: It's tricky.
00:13:15.382 - 00:13:35.742, Speaker E: But what I want is just a level of communication from the Fed that's a little bit more factual. Not more factual, but just speaking to people, being like, we just have such big, they can't acknowledge the fact that, I guess the deficit spending is totally out of control.
00:13:35.796 - 00:13:37.310, Speaker B: They're not talking about the deficit because.
00:13:37.380 - 00:13:41.426, Speaker E: Apparently, I mean, they've got no control over that. So they only respond to whatever, even.
00:13:41.448 - 00:13:43.186, Speaker B: Though these are like revolving doors. I mean.
00:13:43.208 - 00:13:43.346, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:43.368 - 00:13:57.350, Speaker B: The prior Fed chairperson is now the treasury secretary. It's like the same. And they can't acknowledge to regular people the fact, the truth, which they and the government should be clear with. Prices aren't going to come down, most likely. They almost never do.
00:13:57.420 - 00:13:57.702, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:13:57.756 - 00:14:04.118, Speaker B: And in fact, the Fed's terrified of deflation as well. Right. They think that's a huge impediment to growth.
00:14:04.214 - 00:14:04.874, Speaker E: No, absolutely.
00:14:04.992 - 00:14:05.274, Speaker D: Right.
00:14:05.312 - 00:14:21.278, Speaker B: So not only won't, they don't want them to come down, but I don't think people, I mean, you hear this from both people in government, you hear it from the, you don't hear at all anything from the Fed but declaring victory against inflation when people, it'd be great if people were clearer with.
00:14:21.364 - 00:14:44.854, Speaker E: No, absolutely. But then there's, the market knows, then there's just the obvious stuff that this is a topic for another day, but you're going to have social unrest or social issues at some point. These policies in general lead to widening wealth inequality. Right. If nobody can now afford a home, it's like all the homeowners are going to do great.
00:14:44.892 - 00:15:01.290, Speaker B: And even like the deficit spending and the debt has been like a macro watchers issue. But as that interest payment grows and grows, it'll become a real significant issue for fiscal allocation. That really does impact a lot of what they can spend money on.
00:15:01.360 - 00:15:06.640, Speaker E: Absolutely. And that's like, what are the things that people tend to cut first?
00:15:08.050 - 00:15:09.726, Speaker B: They don't cut defense first.
00:15:09.908 - 00:15:14.080, Speaker E: It's like the marginal programs that help the needy and stuff like that.
00:15:15.650 - 00:15:15.966, Speaker D: Right.
00:15:15.988 - 00:15:19.074, Speaker B: So that pain will start to be felt. You're right. There'll be more pressure over time.
00:15:19.112 - 00:15:30.034, Speaker E: And it's also like, what's going to perform well. Equities are going to do okay in the environment generally. Assets are going to do fine. And if the fed starts cutting again, it's assets.
00:15:30.082 - 00:15:31.350, Speaker B: And then we're right back to where we were.
00:15:31.420 - 00:15:41.106, Speaker E: You're going to have the inflation asset owners growing wealth. Here's the real crux of the issue is the risk of reinflation.
00:15:41.218 - 00:15:41.880, Speaker D: Right.
00:15:42.730 - 00:15:45.018, Speaker B: That chart from like 70 and the.
00:15:45.024 - 00:15:47.340, Speaker E: Arthur Burns and Paul Volcker. Right.
00:15:48.270 - 00:16:04.878, Speaker B: That's how you go into like multidecade financial and economic hardship as a country. Right. When you just constantly are offlitting. I mean, inflation got as high as, like, what, 20%? Was that one print? How high did it get? Very high. Interest rates were up in the 20s.
00:16:04.964 - 00:16:05.358, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:05.444 - 00:16:07.762, Speaker E: And so I would think that was.
00:16:07.816 - 00:16:12.178, Speaker B: One of his ideas too. Right. That you had to raise rates above the inflation rate.
00:16:12.264 - 00:16:12.514, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:12.552 - 00:16:16.174, Speaker E: That fundamentally, every time you wanted to get inflation down, you got to get it above.
00:16:16.222 - 00:16:16.482, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:16.536 - 00:16:37.254, Speaker E: But it's like, it's a hard issue. And I think that the trades are easy, which is long bitcoin, because the fiscal stuff ain't changing anytime soon. And gold and Paul Tudor Jones on tv yesterday, making a great case for the two. I would recommend that clip.
00:16:37.302 - 00:16:39.546, Speaker B: Love to see Paul back out here talking about it.
00:16:39.648 - 00:16:42.106, Speaker E: Yeah, let's get Paul and galaxy rings.
00:16:42.298 - 00:16:43.200, Speaker B: Give a.
00:16:47.250 - 00:17:13.446, Speaker E: Know. I don't know if the market has such a nuanced understanding of. Frankly speaking, I think a lot of equity investors just woke up the bonds like a month ago and what it means, the shape of the curve and stuff. Some of these points are probably not as appreciated right now. But six months from now, nine months from now, a year from think, you.
00:17:13.468 - 00:17:24.022, Speaker B: Know, they'll come to a bim now trading. Thanks so much, my friend. Let's go now to our guest, Tony Kai from Atomic Finance. Tony, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:17:24.086 - 00:17:25.014, Speaker F: Happy to be here, Alex.
00:17:25.062 - 00:17:36.494, Speaker B: Yeah, great to have you, and I'm really excited to have you for a variety of reasons, but one that I'm very interested, I think, as our audience knows, about this growing culture of building other stuff on.
00:17:36.612 - 00:17:37.374, Speaker F: Yes, sir.
00:17:37.412 - 00:17:42.974, Speaker B: And atomic finance is a bitcoin defi. What? Company? Yeah, Bitcoin defi company.
00:17:43.012 - 00:17:43.854, Speaker F: Bitcoin defi company.
00:17:43.892 - 00:17:46.654, Speaker B: So tell us what it is first, and tell us about yourself, Tony.
00:17:46.702 - 00:18:23.918, Speaker F: Yeah, so, yeah, atomic finance. We're all about building sound finance for sound money. Some people like to call it bitcoin native defi, but we like to call it sound finance for sound money. Basically trying to build financial tools that are just as self sovereign, transparent and verifiable as bitcoin itself. And basically, our first product right now, our initial product is a mobile app where folks can earn a return on a portion of their stack using covered calls and dlcs. And so I'm sure we'll get into both of those things shortly. But, yeah, that's kind of the high level and basically really kind of.
00:18:23.918 - 00:18:52.870, Speaker F: We started atomic a couple years ago when we kind of saw that. Hey, bitcoin. So, biggest crypto asset out there. Most trustless base layer, but there's no defi, right. So bitcoiners like you and me, we have to use CFI, centralized finance, custodial products, and there's all sorts of counterparty risk that comes with that. It's a black box, and that's what we kind of saw last year. Right.
00:18:52.870 - 00:18:59.734, Speaker F: And so, yeah, let's build out some more kind of non custodial alternatives. That's kind of how we started atomic.
00:18:59.782 - 00:19:07.322, Speaker B: It's very cool. You worked on Ethereum before bitcoin, so you came to bitcoin from the Ethereum world.
00:19:07.376 - 00:19:07.738, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:19:07.824 - 00:19:14.302, Speaker B: I feel like we don't hear that very often. Why or how did that happen?
00:19:14.356 - 00:19:48.646, Speaker F: I mean, I could probably go on for hours on about this, but it's been an interesting journey. I would categorize myself as a Ethereum defi dev turned bitcoin. Maxi turned open minded bitcoiner. Before we were building this kind of eth, defi product was like cross chain lending product and all that kind of stuff. And basically just around Defi summer time when yield farms were. Everybody was setting up their yield farming and all that kind of stuff.
00:19:48.668 - 00:19:57.980, Speaker B: Yeah, it was an exciting time. Yeah, the yams, the poor yams, they failed. I remember yams quite well. It was one of my favorite projects. What a saga, basically.
00:19:59.070 - 00:20:32.038, Speaker F: I remember myself, I was sitting in my office, I was like, kind of like. That was also when I just read kind of the bitcoin standard. So it was like, okay, interesting. There's something unique here about bitcoin that I don't think ethereum or what have you is able to replicate in terms of how decentralized it is. And it's kind of like weird because it's like, okay, all this money printing is happening, and that kind of goes against what I see as one of the big value props for bitcoin, the hard cap and whatnot. And so it was just like, okay, well, does it make sense to keep.
00:20:32.204 - 00:20:34.022, Speaker B: You got pretty well orange pilled, it sounds.
00:20:34.076 - 00:20:46.950, Speaker F: Yeah, I guess I did, right. I got pretty well orange pilled. And I was like, I don't think this makes sense to kind of play the yield farming game to stay in the game, because that's.
00:20:47.030 - 00:20:48.618, Speaker B: That was the game at the time.
00:20:48.784 - 00:20:49.500, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:20:53.490 - 00:21:11.662, Speaker F: We decided to kind of do a little bit of a pivot and kind of look on the bitcoin side to see, okay, well, what is there on bitcoin that we can possibly build on to kind of build out defi tools and whatnot. And that's kind of how we encountered dlcs.
00:21:11.726 - 00:21:25.286, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about dlcs, too. But I have more on this ETH bitcoin journey and story. But let's go. We mentioned dlcs. Let's explain really what you guys are doing and what dlcs are so discrete. Log contracts. That's what they're called, right? Dlcs? What is this?
00:21:25.388 - 00:21:38.954, Speaker F: Yeah, so they're this concept. It actually emerged out of. So Tod Streja, he is one of the co writers of the lightning paper. Dlcs is kind of his baby. It came out of his research.
00:21:39.152 - 00:21:46.394, Speaker B: What didn't Todd do? He's lightning paper with Joe Poon. I mean, I saw him actually a couple weeks ago in Nashville.
00:21:46.442 - 00:21:46.910, Speaker F: Oh, really?
00:21:46.980 - 00:21:50.826, Speaker B: He's great. He works with David Marcus at Lightspark now. I mean, this guy is a bitcoin.
00:21:50.858 - 00:21:51.274, Speaker D: He's everywhere.
00:21:51.322 - 00:21:51.770, Speaker B: Genius.
00:21:51.850 - 00:21:54.766, Speaker F: But I would say he's a bit of an unsung hero, I think.
00:21:54.788 - 00:22:08.002, Speaker B: It's just not sung. I don't know why it's not sung. When you see the guy. He literally invented lightning, basically, among other awesome stuff. Anyway, I'm just chuckling because I agree. Tod is epic. He was at MIT's digital currency initiative for years.
00:22:08.002 - 00:22:15.026, Speaker B: That's how I knew him. I didn't know he had anything to do with dlcs. But now you're telling me this is also one of his projects?
00:22:15.058 - 00:22:16.402, Speaker F: This is also one of his projects.
00:22:16.546 - 00:22:17.266, Speaker B: Not to interrupt.
00:22:17.298 - 00:22:17.446, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:22:17.468 - 00:22:17.750, Speaker B: Go.
00:22:17.820 - 00:22:55.970, Speaker F: No worries. So basically, the idea behind dlcs is that they enable peer to peer, quote unquote smart contracts. Now, they're not the exact same kind of smart contracts you can see on Ethereum. And there are some trade offs. So, for example, the simple thing about dlcs is that you can use it to encode financial instruments like futures contracts and options contracts for us. We decided to use them for options contracts. But basically, if you compare it to something like Ethereum, smart contracts, well, basically you can't do any pooling of funds.
00:22:55.970 - 00:23:32.634, Speaker F: So you can't do everything's like bilateral, there's always two counterparties, right? So peer to peer, you can't do like a compound finance model where you're pooling funds. But basically the trade off is that, well, with that, you don't get any sort of honeypot attacks at the same time. The on chain footprint is very simple and clean. It's just like a two of two multi sig on chain with an oracle attached to it. So basically you can use it to represent any sort of financial instrument that depends on some kind of real world outcome.
00:23:32.682 - 00:23:46.502, Speaker B: So between, like a dealer and a client, for example, I can buy an option from some party, whatever, and they can sell it to me. And then a third party oracle just determines the outcome and then releases the funds one way or the other or whatever.
00:23:46.556 - 00:23:47.254, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:23:47.452 - 00:23:50.642, Speaker B: So it's multi sig with oracles.
00:23:50.786 - 00:23:51.238, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:23:51.324 - 00:24:10.262, Speaker B: And you're saying that together can let you do a lot of interesting stuff. Yes, if it is peer to peer. It's not just that. There's no, it's good for you, Honeypot. So from a security standpoint, it's better. It's also private. You might be able to see some footprint on chain if you examine the entire blockchain.
00:24:10.326 - 00:24:10.938, Speaker F: Right.
00:24:11.104 - 00:24:32.466, Speaker B: But it's not like you just go to app Uniswap.org and look at. It's like I could just have one right now, me and phineas. He could owe me money, could set a thing, give him a plan to pay me back over a period of time with interest. And if he doesn't do it, the oracle seizes his collateral or whatever. You're that phineas. He's giving me the thumbs up.
00:24:32.466 - 00:24:41.782, Speaker B: We're going to get Phineas Mike soon, I promise. Okay, so you're doing options. Explain the covered calls with this scenario here, what people are doing for.
00:24:41.836 - 00:25:37.734, Speaker F: So basically in our initial v one, folks are able to enter basically a cover call passive strategy. So with COVID calls, let's start with the COVID call first. So cover calls, they're a type of option strategy where basically folks are able to earn a premium or earn a return by selling upside on their bitcoin. And so with options, there's a bunch of different strategies in terms of kind of a conservative income generating strategy like cover calls. There's also, of course, speculative strategies, like long options like that. We chose cover calls first because they are one of the most conservative strategies out there in terms of options, because you always end up either with more bitcoin or you end up with a stack. Bitcoin stack that's worth more in dollars.
00:25:37.734 - 00:26:11.538, Speaker F: Right. And so there's no risk of liquidation. There's no risk of getting wiped out or anything like that. And so that's the cool thing about covered calls. They're one of the more conservative strategies out there. And they're very kind of commonly used income generating strategy in tratvi with stocks and other assets as well. How we decided to kind of implement it initially was we wrapped up cover calls in basically a passive strategy where basically it's more like a one click, almost like a defi vault for folks who are familiar with that.
00:26:11.538 - 00:26:32.402, Speaker F: Basically one click, send bitcoin in there. And then basically it kind of relies on an automated passive algorithm to basically enter into covered calls and moving forward. Kind of like we're looking at different ways for folks to be able to do manual options for folks who are a bit more adventurous.
00:26:32.466 - 00:26:32.850, Speaker D: Right.
00:26:32.940 - 00:26:42.938, Speaker F: But initially we found that with our early adopters, folks who tend to care about non custodial, they're not necessarily traders per se.
00:26:43.024 - 00:26:43.466, Speaker D: Right.
00:26:43.568 - 00:26:47.050, Speaker F: And so we wanted to make something a bit more simple and passive.
00:26:47.130 - 00:26:57.390, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very interesting. And it is the type of stuff, of course, that a lot of people do in Defi. Right. And certainly had done. Right. Just generating yield off collateral.
00:26:57.470 - 00:26:57.810, Speaker D: Yes.
00:26:57.880 - 00:27:12.566, Speaker B: The way they're doing it there primarily is putting it in a pool and letting people, other people pay to borrow it back from the pool, take it from the pool. Like you said, that's been hacked a lot and that's risky and it's just different.
00:27:12.668 - 00:27:13.302, Speaker D: Right. Yeah.
00:27:13.356 - 00:27:22.886, Speaker B: Covered call strategy is very interesting and it seems very fitting for a very peer to peer setup too, because you can just replicate it. Like you don't have to have. Everyone doesn't have to be in the same strategy.
00:27:22.918 - 00:27:23.210, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:23.280 - 00:27:30.570, Speaker B: Or in the same exact pool. Are you seeing interest then? So I have an app. You have an app?
00:27:30.640 - 00:27:30.874, Speaker D: Yes.
00:27:30.912 - 00:27:44.762, Speaker B: So if I want to do this, I can go into the app and it's like basically a wallet and says send bitcoin here and then push go or whatever. Pretty much. And then on chain that bitcoin gets put into one of these two of two multi sigs. And who are the holders then? Am I one of the holders?
00:27:44.826 - 00:27:45.102, Speaker D: Yes.
00:27:45.156 - 00:27:49.826, Speaker F: So the user is one of the holders and then the other holder would be our market maker that we work.
00:27:49.848 - 00:27:51.522, Speaker B: With, whoever the counterparty ends up being.
00:27:51.576 - 00:27:51.890, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:27:51.960 - 00:28:04.530, Speaker B: To sell for this trade. And then the Oracle. So it's a two of two. The Oracle doesn't have a key, so they just tell what you guys or who do they report to the Oracle.
00:28:04.690 - 00:28:12.774, Speaker F: They basically make an attestation and then basically the DLC is able to kind of use that attestation to release the funds.
00:28:12.822 - 00:28:13.434, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:28:13.552 - 00:28:13.834, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:28:13.872 - 00:28:18.426, Speaker B: So there's a cryptographic. They're unlocking the key a little bit here.
00:28:18.448 - 00:28:19.420, Speaker F: Yeah, pretty much.
00:28:20.430 - 00:28:36.610, Speaker B: It sounds almost like a thresholded two of three or three of three. But you're saying that it isn't actually. And this is maybe beyond my technical capability it is a two of two. But there's, it's like a lightning channel where the attestations get like part of the script that unlocks the coin one way or another.
00:28:36.680 - 00:28:37.010, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:28:37.080 - 00:28:54.374, Speaker F: Well, what's different between this and say a two of three is that if say the oracle, they disappear. Well then basically you have a refund clause and then basically both parties can get their original amounts back. And so he kind of protects against that edge case.
00:28:54.412 - 00:28:54.726, Speaker B: I see.
00:28:54.748 - 00:28:54.886, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:28:54.908 - 00:29:02.474, Speaker B: Because if they disappear now me and the counterparty have to collaborate to get our funds back because we're the two of three now.
00:29:02.512 - 00:29:03.866, Speaker D: Right, exactly. Yeah.
00:29:03.888 - 00:29:18.110, Speaker B: It sounds really interesting is people using this thing, I mean, simple thing. Are you seeing good adoption of this product, earning passive yield in a relatively conservative way and at least partially non custodial way.
00:29:18.180 - 00:29:18.800, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:19.410 - 00:29:20.810, Speaker B: That sounds pretty compelling.
00:29:20.890 - 00:29:21.470, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:21.620 - 00:29:48.630, Speaker F: So we're in beta right now, so we're on Apple test flight and so getting our approval at the moment with the App Store. But yeah, so far, basically lots of interest from bitcoiners all around in trying out this product with a part of their stack. It's one of those things where it's like dlcs, completely new concept.
00:29:48.970 - 00:29:51.266, Speaker B: Nine of you got to do a lot of explaining.
00:29:51.298 - 00:29:52.120, Speaker D: Right? Exactly.
00:29:53.310 - 00:29:57.014, Speaker F: That's the tough thing about doing something very different from the status quo.
00:29:57.062 - 00:29:57.370, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:57.440 - 00:29:59.114, Speaker F: Like people are always going to question.
00:29:59.232 - 00:30:08.986, Speaker B: What is this in particular in bitcoin too, right? I mean, other communities, people are very skeptical. Other communities are more willing to try new things, innovative. Bitcoin is very conservative.
00:30:09.098 - 00:30:09.614, Speaker D: Yes.
00:30:09.732 - 00:30:12.842, Speaker F: Well maybe that might be changing slightly in terms of the ordinals.
00:30:12.906 - 00:30:13.086, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:13.108 - 00:30:53.418, Speaker B: I don't know if the conservative bitcoiners are changing, but a lot of other new people are coming in and becoming bitcoiners with different ideas. I agree. So it is changing on balance, I think the culture, but it's still quite true. It's also one of the best things about bitcoin that it's hard to. But yes, that presents, I can see a challenge. You got to do a lot of education and outreach to explain how it works and explain the safety. I definitely think when you compare to the CFI of last year, as we mentioned, this is a very compelling response to the stuff that happened to a lot of bitcoiners who to your point, there wasn't anywhere if you wanted yield, you either had to use a different, you couldn't use your bitcoin.
00:30:53.418 - 00:31:01.130, Speaker B: You could theoretically try to wrap it in some way. But mostly people went to all the centralized lenders many of whom collapsed.
00:31:01.210 - 00:31:01.790, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:31:01.940 - 00:31:07.050, Speaker B: Because they weren't transparent or they were pooled, or some of them were even hacked.
00:31:07.130 - 00:31:11.010, Speaker F: Some of them were even just going and I think playing around in some.
00:31:11.080 - 00:31:12.994, Speaker B: Like just taking the money and doing something else with it.
00:31:13.032 - 00:31:13.474, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:31:13.592 - 00:31:16.418, Speaker B: And this is much more transparent and decentralized.
00:31:16.514 - 00:31:16.726, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:31:16.748 - 00:31:26.214, Speaker F: I think one of the issues that we saw was that there was a bit of a complacency with certain bitcoiners where.
00:31:26.252 - 00:31:26.550, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:31:26.620 - 00:31:34.710, Speaker F: Basically to do you either hoddle your bitcoin and that's obviously fully self sovereign, or if you do want to do something, I guess you just have to do that custodially.
00:31:34.790 - 00:31:35.130, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:35.200 - 00:31:41.550, Speaker F: And there was kind of like almost like an acceptance or like complacency, kind of like, okay, that's just the way it is.
00:31:41.620 - 00:31:41.854, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:41.892 - 00:31:59.102, Speaker F: That's bitcoin. And I think that last year has taught us a lot of very valuable lessons around. When you don't kind of know what's actually going on underneath, like where your returns and yields are coming from. Well, then you should be a little bit skeptical.
00:31:59.166 - 00:31:59.538, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:59.624 - 00:32:08.146, Speaker F: And basically, bitcoin is designed to be programmable money, but all of the things that collapsed last year didn't use the programmable feature.
00:32:08.258 - 00:32:08.920, Speaker D: Right.
00:32:10.010 - 00:32:16.854, Speaker F: It was a tradfi setup for bitcoin, which is meant to be this kind of new age of money.
00:32:16.892 - 00:32:17.094, Speaker D: Right.
00:32:17.132 - 00:32:22.890, Speaker B: So true. They just took the extremely powerful programmable money and just had it sit there.
00:32:22.960 - 00:32:23.482, Speaker D: Yes.
00:32:23.616 - 00:32:28.582, Speaker B: And then they built a bunch of tradfi lending stuff around it. Well, it was worse than, it was much worse.
00:32:28.646 - 00:32:36.738, Speaker F: It was worse than tradfi in some ways, because first of all, you don't have the regulatory frameworks that we have in tradfi.
00:32:36.774 - 00:33:05.366, Speaker B: Well, let's be real. I would trust fidelity with my money more than any of these lending startups. Yes, I was talking about this. Here's another thing, too. Let's step back a little, because I want to think about the DeFi ecosystem and value proposition, just generally as a concept. Defi, right. And you have the curve founder, he had some loans on his curve tokens, and that became an issue recently or whatever, because the curve, there was a brief vulnerability, and then the thing and whatever, the curve tokens were going down.
00:33:05.366 - 00:33:15.146, Speaker B: He had to sell some, but his were tied up in a lot of Defi. He had borrowed dollars or stables off of his curve tokens. Right. So everyone's watching to make sure he doesn't get liquidated and all that.
00:33:15.168 - 00:33:15.450, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:15.520 - 00:33:47.906, Speaker B: Which is the transparency is very exciting, I'll say that. And I think probably a good thing, but exciting, no doubt, to watch these. Anyway, though, the thing I said was, if fidelity had accepted or anyone, I'm just using fidelity as like an upright, traditional institution because I worked there. But if they had accepted, done securities lending, offered securities lending on curve tokens, I'm sure he'd preferred to go there. I would. Right. And sort of the corollary to this point is that Defi is not challenging tradfi today.
00:33:47.906 - 00:34:04.106, Speaker B: Defi is basically, well, there's some assets that we can't do anything with, so let's build our own place to do it with. We're not bringing in. No one's coming to Defi because they can't do something here. There was a whole thing when yields existed in Defi, although most of them was. Where did the yields come from?
00:34:04.128 - 00:34:04.362, Speaker D: Right.
00:34:04.416 - 00:34:05.734, Speaker B: Mostly like token printing.
00:34:05.782 - 00:34:06.380, Speaker D: Right.
00:34:06.750 - 00:34:32.350, Speaker B: But now there's also better yields in tradfi, so no one's coming. But you have people that own these assets that they can't use in tradfi. So that's the market for Defi today. Do you think that ever changes? Does Defi merge with tradfi? Does tradfi come use Defi or whatever? Or are we destined to have these crypto people with tokens that GS and the banks won't lend them on? Well, you're going to have to use compound finance or whatever curve.
00:34:32.430 - 00:34:52.134, Speaker F: Yeah, I think that's a great question. I think it's one of those things where I think that if there is some kind of incentive for some of these tradfi institutions and they get some kind of. If a lot of their customers are crypto natives, they start demanding it, then I think that's.
00:34:52.182 - 00:34:53.050, Speaker B: They probably will.
00:34:53.200 - 00:34:54.940, Speaker F: Yeah, but without.
00:34:56.350 - 00:34:56.762, Speaker D: Why?
00:34:56.816 - 00:34:57.578, Speaker F: Why would they?
00:34:57.664 - 00:35:11.534, Speaker B: So then if they do add it, then you don't need the DeFi for it, really. I think there are really good ways when it comes to Defi, the transparency, knowing for sure what the rules are.
00:35:11.572 - 00:35:12.014, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:12.132 - 00:35:40.294, Speaker B: The risk management is very. It's easy to do risk management in that way because you know exactly the level you are liquidated. Some people say, well, it's responsible in the financial system to be able to call up the lender and wiggle out of it a little bit if need be. We need that flex in the financial. Well, you have that flex. There's still a point where it's automatically. Because you know where it's liquidated, you know the exact LTV you have to maintain, and you know with certainty the system, how it will act, different things.
00:35:40.294 - 00:36:10.194, Speaker B: Well, then you just build the buffer above that. You have the flexibility above that point. Right. And that's very powerful. But again, so there are reasons why finance could be great in DeFi and should be. But I agree, if the tradfi adds support for the assets, that's sort of my point, is that DeFi is really just tools for these specific assets. If other types of tools, like the brokerage firms everyone already uses, would let you put those assets there, I think a lot of people would.
00:36:10.194 - 00:36:30.258, Speaker B: I don't think we're really at the step function increase yet in Defi's capabilities and value proposition to actually say, you know what? No, I don't want to do the lending through this. I would actually prefer to be on chain. But this plays the same thing, right? I mean, you've got bitcoiners with bitcoin and nowhere to do anything with it safely and transparently.
00:36:30.354 - 00:36:30.758, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:36:30.844 - 00:36:47.854, Speaker B: So there's clearly a market, and obviously Defi is a pretty big market in crypto anyway. But that's what I really struggle with. Wondering the long term outcome here of does DeFi become just like some of the underlying financial plumbing and we still just have the counterparties still run the industry, basically? I don't know.
00:36:47.972 - 00:36:48.878, Speaker F: It's a good question.
00:36:48.964 - 00:36:49.310, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:49.380 - 00:37:13.974, Speaker F: I think as more of the clients that some of these stratify companies are dealing with become crypto natives and become like bitcoin holders, then I think that there's really kind of no reason why I don't see them demanding more transparency, because of all the hard lessons that we're learning as a space right now.
00:37:14.012 - 00:37:15.826, Speaker B: No matter how reputable the tradfi firm.
00:37:15.858 - 00:37:26.266, Speaker F: Is, because there's no bailouts in bitcoin. Right. Basically, if there's a giant mess, know Uncle Sam's not going to compensate you for it.
00:37:26.288 - 00:37:27.542, Speaker B: That's the value proposition.
00:37:27.686 - 00:37:28.186, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:37:28.288 - 00:37:30.018, Speaker B: There's no fed backstop on bitcoin.
00:37:30.054 - 00:37:32.458, Speaker F: And so I think that Toshi doesn't.
00:37:32.474 - 00:37:34.394, Speaker B: Pop out and print another 21 million coins.
00:37:34.442 - 00:37:35.040, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:37:37.170 - 00:37:49.138, Speaker F: So I think that folks who are crypto natives and know about these kind of characteristics of bitcoin, they're going to be the ones demanding more transparency and what have you.
00:37:49.224 - 00:37:51.394, Speaker B: And that group of people is growing, too, right?
00:37:51.512 - 00:37:51.986, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:37:52.088 - 00:38:04.582, Speaker B: So in that way, too, it's not just the transparency, but it's the noncustodial nature too. Right. That's really important in your design. Is that philosophical or is that practical, or is it both?
00:38:04.716 - 00:38:37.490, Speaker F: I think that we were definitely coming in at it with philosophical kind of angle, like, how does this mesh with our vision for what bitcoin is like, bitcoin is going to be for us. We came into bitcoin and crypto space because of the programmable money aspects of it, where basically this is a form of money that you don't need to trust a counterparty or a central party to kind of hold and use.
00:38:37.560 - 00:38:38.180, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:38.950 - 00:38:49.830, Speaker F: But where does that boundary of use? Where should that be? Because right now you can use it in the sense that you can send it to someone else without trusting a counterparty.
00:38:50.250 - 00:38:50.614, Speaker D: Okay.
00:38:50.652 - 00:39:32.910, Speaker F: But there's also. There's other stuff, other stuff that you can do with money. Generally, for bitcoin to be a bona fide financial asset, well, there needs to be financial tools built on bitcoin. And so far, all those financial tools have been centralized and custodial. And as we kind of know, beyond the black box point as well, custodial bitcoin is fairly easy to confiscate, fairly easy to freeze. And so to the extent that we can build an alternative that allows folks who want to do it noncustodially to be able to do so, I think that's super crucial to give that alternative.
00:39:32.990 - 00:39:33.474, Speaker B: Love that.
00:39:33.512 - 00:39:33.666, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:39:33.688 - 00:40:02.554, Speaker B: And I think that is at the core of a bitcoin value proposition. In the same way I always say, like, you could hold your bitcoin at a custodian or you might buy the ETF, right? And that's totally fine. There's different places, reasons, trade offs to make here and there, but that it is essential that, well, every person should know how to self custody. If they don't, I actually think everyone should have a minimum of some bitcoin in self custody because that's actual bitcoin. If you're paper bitcoin, it's not paper bitcoin. And by the way, you can use it on the bitcoin network.
00:40:02.602 - 00:40:02.862, Speaker D: Okay?
00:40:02.916 - 00:40:06.362, Speaker B: I can't send you my ETF shares globally on lightning.
00:40:06.506 - 00:40:06.814, Speaker D: Right.
00:40:06.852 - 00:40:40.246, Speaker B: So it's not useful in the same way. And the same is true, I think, when you think about defi here as well, right. You may not want to use it for this, but you sometimes should. Maintaining the optionality. This is what I was going to say, maintaining the optionality. And by the way, aggressively lobbying for that protection in law, right. I don't care necessarily if everyone self custodies, but I care very much that everyone can self custody because that's that exit valve.
00:40:40.246 - 00:40:41.546, Speaker B: That's the check on the system.
00:40:41.648 - 00:40:42.620, Speaker D: Yes, exactly.
00:40:46.110 - 00:40:59.086, Speaker F: If we're talking about bitcoin as digital gold. Well, okay, what happened with gold? Right? Okay, folks, can store it easily. But if you wanted to use it as cloud or for a loan, right. If you wanted to put it on.
00:40:59.108 - 00:41:01.690, Speaker B: Like a horse drawn carriage and cart it down to the bank, it's heavy.
00:41:01.770 - 00:41:02.014, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:41:02.052 - 00:41:24.982, Speaker F: Well, that was the advantage that bitcoin gave us, because it was a lot more portable and divisible and all that kind of stuff. But then with gold to do financial tools with it, you obviously had to give it to a custodian, you had to entrust them with it, and you get back your paper gold or what have you. And basically, that's currently the status quo for bitcoin as well. We did not improve on that so far.
00:41:25.036 - 00:41:29.126, Speaker B: Right. But it's much more programmable, surely we must have waves.
00:41:29.318 - 00:41:30.246, Speaker F: Well, dlcs.
00:41:30.278 - 00:41:30.666, Speaker D: There you go.
00:41:30.688 - 00:41:31.914, Speaker B: I know, I love it.
00:41:31.952 - 00:41:32.540, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:41:35.790 - 00:41:45.658, Speaker F: I think that we should be pushing the boundaries more of some of the programmable aspects of bitcoin that are still underexplored and should be explored.
00:41:45.834 - 00:42:08.886, Speaker B: Have you looked into how deep are you in tap group, tap script type stuff that people. This is really elite, advanced stuff. But like, rob Hamilton at Anchor watch is a friend. He's been on the show a couple of times, or once on the show. And have you seen his mini script? Have you seen all the stuff on some. I mean, it's really actually incredible how powerful bitcoin script actually is. It's just very difficult.
00:42:08.886 - 00:42:46.962, Speaker B: Miniscript makes it a lot easier. And I mean, Rob's coming up with incredible decaying multi sigs, multi threshold decaying multi sigs, big giant quorums that have sub quorums, which apparently you can actually already do. It's just like it was too complicated to even develop without using miniscript, which is the sort of higher level language that Andrew Polstra created. Literally, you can do a lot of what people thought we needed covenants for. And like OPCTV, not all of it, obviously, but you can do a lot again. So raising you talk about pushing the boundaries of bitcoin's programmability. There are a lot of people working on that now.
00:42:46.962 - 00:43:11.414, Speaker B: It makes me really happy. We don't have to have the debate about what's good and bad to do on bitcoin, blah, blah, blah. I'm not talking about really. I'm talking about using stuff you can do on bitcoin right now. I'm not, forget what we want. We're not calling for an upgrade. I'm saying bitcoin is highly programmable money, but a lot of people really are just stacking and hoddling, which is fine, but it really doesn't have.
00:43:11.414 - 00:43:20.886, Speaker B: The Builder hasn't had bitcoin, the builder culture that say Ethereum has to have a lot of other people build other things using a lot of these tools. I mean, there's literally opcodes no one uses.
00:43:20.998 - 00:43:21.370, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:21.440 - 00:44:03.500, Speaker F: I mean, that's coming from Ethereum as a builder there. That was definitely something I noticed in terms of the difference in culture. Right. In Ethereum, I mean, say what you will about obviously the quality of the base layer, how decentralized it is and these kinds of things, but in terms of culture, there was very much a kind of builder centric culture, encouraging experimentation, lots of hackathons, lots of grants and these kinds of things, encouraging folks to try different things and innovate, really. And in bitcoin, definitely is less of that. Right. Even if we just look at.
00:44:04.270 - 00:44:06.122, Speaker B: And obviously there is great stuff.
00:44:06.176 - 00:44:06.538, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:06.624 - 00:44:08.346, Speaker B: But it's not nearly as much, I.
00:44:08.368 - 00:44:09.402, Speaker F: Would say not at the same level.
00:44:09.456 - 00:44:09.674, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:09.712 - 00:44:11.066, Speaker B: I mean, you have great stuff.
00:44:11.168 - 00:44:12.458, Speaker F: Hopefully we can encourage more.
00:44:12.544 - 00:44:22.202, Speaker B: Yeah. You have like pleb fimming, Jeremy Rubin's thing. You have bitcoin plus, plus tab comp. You have wolf incubator. I mean, there's plenty.
00:44:22.346 - 00:44:23.114, Speaker F: And it's growing.
00:44:23.162 - 00:44:33.826, Speaker B: Yeah, it's growing, but I agree. Right. I think it's quite different. And it's because also I think people looked at bitcoin and said, well, you can't really. It's bitcoin. It's for that one thing, and you can't really program that much on it. That's what they would say.
00:44:33.826 - 00:44:37.330, Speaker B: It's just not true. But it's just not true. Yeah, it's not true.
00:44:37.400 - 00:44:38.098, Speaker D: I mean, when I was a.
00:44:38.104 - 00:44:42.026, Speaker B: We don't have persistent state smart contracts.
00:44:42.078 - 00:44:42.342, Speaker D: Yes.
00:44:42.396 - 00:44:44.930, Speaker B: That's what we don't have. But it's still highly programmable.
00:44:45.010 - 00:44:45.398, Speaker D: Yes.
00:44:45.484 - 00:44:53.542, Speaker F: I mean, when I was in the Ethereum ecosystem, that was like the narrative around bitcoin. Oh, it's just a shiny rock.
00:44:53.606 - 00:44:53.882, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:53.936 - 00:44:54.646, Speaker B: They call it a pet rock.
00:44:54.678 - 00:44:55.900, Speaker D: Yeah, pet rock, exactly.
00:44:56.270 - 00:45:17.940, Speaker B: Roy Nas, the audio audience. Yeah. So what else have you noticed, by the way, for this trend? And also, what else are your thoughts about Ethan versus bitcoin? I'm personally of the view that they're not competitive, so they're two very different projects. Yes. But how do you think about them?
00:45:20.630 - 00:45:59.310, Speaker F: There's the dev angle tooling and all that kind of stuff is way very advanced. Very advanced. And there was the money to do that partially because of how they launched Ethereum. Right. That side of things is very well developed in Ethereum and easier to get started as a developer. I mean you can be a JavaScript developer and JavaScript's basically every computer science student learns how to do Javascript these days. And you can be a JavaScript developer and basically start programming Ethereum solidity smart contracts that can move millions of dollars, right? It's pretty crazy actually.
00:45:59.380 - 00:46:01.482, Speaker B: So from a dev culture it's easy to onboard.
00:46:01.546 - 00:46:08.006, Speaker F: Easy to onboard, that's for sure. But of course that comes with the drawback.
00:46:08.058 - 00:46:13.026, Speaker B: Then you have a bunch of junior Javascript developers making permissionless finance apps that.
00:46:13.128 - 00:46:16.006, Speaker F: Break that are losing people millions or.
00:46:16.028 - 00:46:16.818, Speaker D: Even hundreds of millions.
00:46:16.834 - 00:46:17.654, Speaker B: There's a lot of risk there.
00:46:17.692 - 00:47:10.962, Speaker F: There's a lot of risk. So there's a trade off there. I think that what we really need to kind of push harder on, on the bitcoin side of things is bringing back the spirit of experimentation and kind of encouraging folks to try different use cases out. Because on bitcoin, I think I'm a product person. So I think about things from a product perspective. Bitcoin has reached product market fit with being a store of value asset, something that people can easily buy and hold, right, and wait for a number to go up and these kinds of things. But why don't we kind of explore whether we can get market fit in other areas in bitcoin as well, right? Like obviously we have the ordinals movement and the collectibles and whatnot.
00:47:10.962 - 00:47:57.554, Speaker F: And why can't bitcoin also serve as a defi layer? Right? The thing I sometimes worry about is what if we stick to the status quo with this? Oh, this is something you just buy and hoddle and wait for number go up. But what if, because we're constrained by that narrative, we hit a local maximum and we don't actually reach the full potential for bitcoin because, okay, take another decentralized protocol. The Internet, right? The first use cases were obviously a much, very small subset of the current use cases. And because we allow folks to experiment with different use cases and try new things, obviously that brought more people onto the Internet because that was like, hey, that's a useful thing.
00:47:57.592 - 00:48:02.114, Speaker B: And we end up so far from Arpanet, like sending messages from like Cal Berkeley or wherever.
00:48:02.162 - 00:48:02.760, Speaker F: Exactly.
