00:00:01.160 - 00:00:16.222, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. All right, friends, it's Mike. No regrets. We're here next with Novo. And I have the lovely Sarah Mayojas.
00:00:16.398 - 00:00:16.990, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:17.102 - 00:00:42.786, Speaker A: Mayojas, everybody, all at once. We met at a criminal justice dinner a few years ago, and much to my surprise, Sarah wasn't just a criminal justice advocate. She was an artist and a technologist. And so here we are today, talking about the NFT space projects she's got coming up and just her life in general. Welcome.
00:00:42.930 - 00:00:44.974, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for having me.
00:00:45.514 - 00:00:48.906, Speaker A: So talk about New York City, kid to artist, right?
00:00:49.010 - 00:01:03.422, Speaker B: So I went to Penn. I grew up in New York City. I went to Dalton, and then as a good Dalton graduate, I went to the University of Pennsylvania, and I studied finance and international studies. And then.
00:01:03.478 - 00:01:04.798, Speaker A: Were you pretty cliche at this point?
00:01:04.846 - 00:01:13.434, Speaker B: Yeah, very cliche. Until I did a 360 into an MFA at Yale right out of undergrad.
00:01:14.574 - 00:01:15.462, Speaker A: To become an artist.
00:01:15.518 - 00:01:16.518, Speaker B: To become an artist.
00:01:16.606 - 00:01:23.134, Speaker A: And it was just too many New York City kids going to Wall street that you were just like, I can't be part of that crew.
00:01:23.794 - 00:02:06.894, Speaker B: You know, it was kind of a bet because I had, and I still am interested in finance, right? But I had taken a few photography classes, and I really, really enjoyed it, and I looked at the possibility of being a successful artist. It's like the best job in the world, right? If you can make it work, it's the most amazing thing. And so it's kind of a bet. Like, let me go to grad school. I had gotten in, which was wild, and if it doesn't work out, I can always go back into finance, and if it does work out, then it's. I mean, I think it's the best career. So I had the luxury to be able to take that risk.
00:02:06.894 - 00:02:36.098, Speaker B: So when I was in grad school, I was thinking a lot about the concept of value, because art has a very interesting relationship to value. It is like, the thing in the world where the input materially is compared to how much it's valued, is the most divorced compared to any other paint canvas.
00:02:36.226 - 00:02:36.862, Speaker A: That's it.
00:02:36.938 - 00:02:45.358, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. You know, people have compared it to, like, alchemy, right? You're turning a bunch of, like, raw materials into gold.
00:02:45.486 - 00:02:57.914, Speaker A: So how does a young artist, like, look at this world and be like, okay, there's this kind of pyramid, and how do you get noticed? And how do you find your own tribe to care about the story you're telling?
00:02:58.534 - 00:03:58.134, Speaker B: So I was seeing, you know, I was at the time while I was still in grad school, I was seeing this system, and I was like, I think I saw it for what it was, which is, it's very much a network. It's very much about circulation. How is it circulating? With who is it circulating? How is it exchanged? And so I decided to make an artwork that made that system clear. Right. I decided to enter the market, if you will, by creating a market where the whole work of art was in the exchange, in a big coming out of relational aesthetics, which was a movement in art that focused on social relations. But I was locating it very much more in the exchange. So that's where the Bitchcoin project was initiated, which.
00:03:58.134 - 00:04:43.794, Speaker B: So, bitchcoin, the three trends that I kind of was seeing at the time. One was the financialization of the art world. Two was the beginning of people turning themselves into brands, the influencer, and then blockchain and bitcoin. At the time, this was. Yeah, so this was 2014. So I found someone to help me on the Internet to make an altcoin. And I did this project with a Yale PhD student and another artist who had created, like, a gallery in a shipping container unit in Brooklyn.
00:04:43.794 - 00:05:00.974, Speaker B: And we turned the gallery into a mine. So it was painted pink, and it had, like, mylar to make it super reflective. And you could only see it via webcam, and it was mining bitch coins.
00:05:02.874 - 00:05:05.694, Speaker A: How do I get a bitchcoin? I gotta get a bitchcoin.
00:05:09.514 - 00:05:37.914, Speaker B: And so I really love the idea as the gallery, as the mine. But what was my bitchcoin? You know, the bitchcoin, what could I make it worth something? So I decided to back it like a backed currency at a fixed rate by my photography, and I made a new series, and that's where I started the series that I called speculations. Kind of apt to back a cryptocurrency by speculation.
00:05:39.814 - 00:05:43.074, Speaker A: Well, it's funny, now we have these social tokens.
00:05:43.154 - 00:05:43.578, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:43.666 - 00:06:10.986, Speaker A: Right? So if you think about whale shark and the whale community, you know, it started as a social community, and the token just was given out to people that were curating the community, or they were watching the community or participating, and then they end up backing it with nfts he bought or they bought in the whale vault. And so it's a whole new ecosystem. It's interesting. So you were kind of ahead of that idea of like, okay, we're going to back this with photography about speculating.
00:06:11.170 - 00:06:30.778, Speaker B: Yeah. So. And also, you know, you. So it was backed by these physical prints, and photography as a medium has, you know, is kind of a precursor to digital art in the sense that it's endlessly reproducible. And the market has decided that in order to make it valuable, we need to print it and make editions of six.
00:06:30.826 - 00:06:47.794, Speaker A: How do I know that those two very expensive photographs are actually limited edition? Right. You've got to trust the gallerist, you've got to trust the community. You're part of the artist. And if he gets caught, his credibility goes to hell. But it's not on a blockchain. There's a real trust, a centralized trust.
00:06:47.834 - 00:06:56.530, Speaker B: Structure, and the photography market forever has kind of traded a huge discount to painting.
00:06:56.602 - 00:06:57.214, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:58.274 - 00:07:21.378, Speaker B: Because even if you trust the gallery, there's still kind of the human fetish of like, the index of the gesture on the canvas. So. Right, speculation. Bitchcoin. So you could convert either back into the print or into any of my future work. So you were kind of investing in me as the artist, right.
00:07:21.466 - 00:07:33.582, Speaker A: And when you sold bitchcoin, what portion of your future you did you think you were selling? 1%, 5%, 10%? Your arm, your leg?
00:07:33.678 - 00:07:35.510, Speaker B: Well, it was 25 square inches.
00:07:35.622 - 00:08:15.098, Speaker A: 25 square inches of you per coin. But it's interesting when, like an artist says, I'm gonna sell a piece of my future work. Yeah, it is like, okay, here's my foot. Or like, we've thought a lot about, can we tokenize athletes? Right? You can take young athletes and say, geez, we'll give you money upfront and we can, you know, people can trade how much money they think you're going to make. If you use money as one way of art's kind of interesting, you could get 1% of my future sales. Kind of what you did, but just not officially. What did you learn from the experience? A is it existence now? Is it still floating around?
00:08:15.146 - 00:08:37.374, Speaker B: So I had so, you know, fast forward. So I had pre minted basically, like a very large supply, and it was on its own native chain. And looking back, I would have, you know, had more nodes. But, you know, at the time, this was like, not. I wasn't thinking about that crypto artist.
00:08:37.494 - 00:08:39.014, Speaker A: What, you were an early crypto pilot?
00:08:39.054 - 00:09:27.086, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So it launched in February of 2015. Since then, I worked on bigger projects, a lot of which had to do with how we think about value, the biggest one being cloud of petals, which we can talk about. But now I am doing a reboot of bitchcoin and doing a new release. And it's going to be an auction, a dedicated auction with Philips, the auction house. And each new bitcoin is, well, it's not a new bitchcoin, but this one, you know, the new backing of bitchcoins are 3291 pressed petals from my cloud of petals.
00:09:27.086 - 00:09:32.134, Speaker B: Project actual pressed pedals, actual pressed petals, physical pressed petals.
00:09:32.294 - 00:09:35.838, Speaker A: So the coin is backed by a petal, and the petal will be kept.
00:09:35.886 - 00:10:16.924, Speaker B: Where the pedal is kept in my storage. And this is the. I get to be the steward of these pedals. And other people can kind of own it and trade it. And the pedals are kind of like, they're sort of an analog proof of work type of thing, because that project, I had 16 men picking and photographing 100,000 rose petals in the former bell labs. This was like this giant performance, 30 minutes, 16 millimeter film. And then we used AI to generate new images of rose petals.
00:10:16.924 - 00:10:44.984, Speaker B: And there were VR, you know, VR works that were particle systems of rose petals that would react to your gaze with perfume kind of misting around you. But the relic of the whole big performance were these press petals, because I asked all the men to pick one petal per rose that they considered most beautiful. So there are over 30 petals in a rose, basically. So they would pick one. And it's. And it's like their kind of subjectivity.
00:10:49.164 - 00:10:50.988, Speaker A: So I keep thinking about nfTs.
00:10:51.076 - 00:10:51.548, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:51.636 - 00:10:53.956, Speaker A: And there's the plethora of them.
00:10:54.060 - 00:10:54.744, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:55.264 - 00:11:23.964, Speaker A: Prices go up. We always have a supply response. Every creative thinks, I've got to put my thing into an NFT, and I think about what will be create long term value. And I always come to the same things. If it touches something emotionally in me, if it brings back a time and place. And so if I'm at a virtual concert and it's Travis Scott playing on discord or whatever, he played on, on. Not on discord, on fortnite.
00:11:23.964 - 00:11:52.704, Speaker A: And all of a sudden, a cause balloon, mylar balloon, flows over and floats over the audience, and I see it, and I'm like, oh, my God, there's a million people watching, or 100 million people watching, that balloon will have a whole lot of value one day, because it'll be the balloon we all witness together, collectively. And so when I think about the first thing that pops in my head with the pedals is if I experience the show, if I smelled the perfume, if I was part of it, probably has more value to me.
00:11:52.784 - 00:11:53.484, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:54.144 - 00:12:26.056, Speaker A: And so how do you, I don't know how many people watched the show or when they saw it. How do you go beyond that audience? So those people will be like, yes, I'm going to buy this. It's a souvenir in some ways, it's a memory. And maybe when Sarah becomes wildly famous, like the next Picasso, people would be like, dude, you were at that show. Radical, right? And so that's why we collect things to some degree. How do you broaden the audience of people that want the pedal?
00:12:26.160 - 00:13:33.556, Speaker B: You know, when I came up with cloud of petals, it was. It was like a folly, right? I went to, I saw this completely empty, dusty bell labs, and I had this dream of making this cloud of petals and essentially of. I was thinking very much about the nature of photography changing about data. This was like me harvesting data to model the way companies do harvest our data and model our desire and feed it back to us. And so I was very interested in the future of data and labor and automation and AI. And I stumbled upon Bell Labs, and, I mean, it was maybe mid June at the time, and by mid August, I was there with the full setup, and I knew no one was going to be able to see this, right? So I made a movie. So I made a 30 minutes film that went to a bunch of film festivals and generally, and the exhibition we did in New York, it was like an 8000 square foot show, three month run, free and open to the public.
00:13:33.556 - 00:14:11.704, Speaker B: It got, I think, 12 million impressions online. Like, it got, like, a lot of. But that. But real life art is always very limited by geography. That's one of the things that I've found difficult. You really are limited by how much I, Sarah Mi Ojas, can do going from one city to another doing different shows. And to a certain extent, we've done some pre sales with mostly crypto only, crypto native kind of investors.
00:14:11.704 - 00:14:36.826, Speaker B: And the thing that I think the winning combination here, for them at least, is, one, that I was so early in the space that it's almost like a proto NFT, and two, that I'm linking it to something physical, that I can't go back in time and make more of these petals, and that these petals are part of a huge body of work.
00:14:36.930 - 00:14:52.378, Speaker A: What's cool about a lot of these projects is they're going to be kind of pioneers in how we start selling things in the digital world. Now, when I get the NFT, it's just basically an ownership certificate. I don't have a visual of my rose, or do I?
00:14:52.426 - 00:14:56.666, Speaker B: You have a twirling gold coin.
00:14:56.770 - 00:14:57.256, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:57.370 - 00:14:58.548, Speaker B: Of bitch coin.
00:14:58.676 - 00:15:13.892, Speaker A: Right. It would be interesting, though. Like, I'm just making this up as I sit here, that in that coin, it gives me access to the show so I can go into the metaverse and I'd be like, I'm gonna bathe in my 20 really cool rose petals.
00:15:13.988 - 00:15:37.424, Speaker B: But to a certain extent, most of this information, like, a lot of the cloud of petals information, but just generally with nfts, you know, it's freely available information. Anybody can go watch the film, just like anybody can go. And, you know, it's interesting now thinking about whether NFTs can give you access to private experiences.
00:15:37.584 - 00:16:16.524, Speaker A: Well, if I'm wearing an NFT jacket to a party where I know people are gonna have ar glasses, they're gonna hit the ar, and I'm gonna be wearing, like, dripping in my cool gucci, nft, one of a kind. Right. I want to be showing off this cool jacket. I want it to be the only one or one of ten, right. Or that's what gives it its value. And so the uniqueness of things, you know, having an NFT that connects to something unique. Right? I'm talking about the earth Fisher egg that spun around with the big lighter in it.
00:16:16.524 - 00:16:24.708, Speaker A: And I keep thinking, once you have your glasses, I didn't buy it. I tried to, and I. Someone else outbid me, but I could, like, float it above my shoulder.
00:16:24.836 - 00:16:25.116, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:25.140 - 00:16:29.964, Speaker A: And people with their glasses could see it. And so, like, your rose petals, even though they're thousand.
00:16:30.044 - 00:16:34.260, Speaker B: No, they're 3291, 3291.
00:16:34.292 - 00:16:47.984, Speaker A: Each one's different. And so if you collected, like, 20, you could have, like, a rose petal thing, but you kind of want other people not to be able to see them. You could see the film, but not the actual pedal.
00:16:48.144 - 00:16:59.296, Speaker B: If you redeem your pedal, you can have the petal. If you really want to look at the pedal, I'll take a photograph of the pedal for you. But it's not really about, you know, the specific wrinkle.
00:16:59.400 - 00:17:25.594, Speaker A: One thing that's clear when you have these conversations is that this is such a new space, both from a regulatory perspective, from how artists involve themselves with it, how users and how fans and as consumers will evolve. And so this idea of value coming from your, you know, creative genius, from your life experience that's out there has to be limited to some degree.
00:17:25.674 - 00:18:05.754, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's, it's. There's a real interesting relationship right now with creators in the NFT space talking about scarcity. You know, to a certain extent, a lot of the digital artists who have done well, they are not creating scarce things. They're doing drops, you know, every few days. Right. With imagery that is a slight iteration on the thing that they just dropped often, sometimes with, you know, these open editions that are like 700 editions of the same image.
00:18:05.754 - 00:18:07.654, Speaker B: Right. This is not a scarce.
00:18:07.954 - 00:18:29.410, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's two. I'm convinced. We're launching a business upstairs on one vertical. And we originally thought, oh, it's all this collectibles. And I'm like, no, no, no. There's going to be 10% or less collectible things that appreciate in value, because in life, most shit doesn't appreciate in value.
00:18:29.410 - 00:18:50.290, Speaker A: The rest are gonna be consumables. It's gonna be gamified. It's gonna be experiential. Like, what will you pay for that experience that week, that day? That. That some of it's gambling. Right. And so that part, I think that part will die down a little bit over time, but I think you can split nfts into collectible nfts and consumerable.
00:18:50.290 - 00:19:08.904, Speaker A: I'm gonna watch keenly, and I actually think the whole space is going to go through this kind of washout, unwash out, and we really won't know how. Fine art community, or the performance art community participates, uses the NFT space probably for years.
00:19:09.484 - 00:19:32.496, Speaker B: It's also in relation to art. You know, as an artist, I work. I do work that's digital too. Like, I could have chosen to make a digital kind of NFT that really just, you know, was more direct. Wasn't like this bitch coin that you're redeeming. You know, that you can redeem that is backed by your whole thing is.
00:19:32.520 - 00:19:34.416, Speaker A: Almost like a part of a performance art project.
00:19:34.520 - 00:20:32.628, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's. Yeah, it's a conceptual piece, and it also makes me more comfortable with the price being so visible, because as an artist, you put something out there, and then the price takes up as much attention as the image on all of the platforms so far, especially when the images are so small and the price tag is so big. That's kind of dystopic in a way. You do want a little bit of separation. It doesn't also serve the art because, and I think galleries are resisting. Galleries are very nervous about nfTs, extremely nervous, because art is served by an illusion of scarcity.
00:20:32.628 - 00:20:46.272, Speaker B: It is the gallery's job to make sure you don't think that there are like, 20 more in the back room. Right. And that they're keeping them for in the future. You know, they're managing 100% the supply.
00:20:46.408 - 00:21:16.412, Speaker A: It's really interesting because right now, most of NFTs have been bought by crypto people. Most of crypto, forget just nfTs, Defi NFTs protocols. 90% is speculative. It's gambling it's gambling on stuff that is going to build the architecture of the future. I don't want to demean what's going on. I think what's going on is awesome. The crypto community is a gambling community, and certainly in the NFT space, that can't last.
00:21:16.412 - 00:21:44.564, Speaker A: The reality is, over time, there'll always be some gambling towards it, but it's got to serve a real purpose. And I think galleries are wise to not dive in to try to understand the space, because they've spent years cultivating this idea of scarcity. My always advice is go slow. Don't be first in some of this stuff, because we don't have the displays yet, the real world displays. We don't have the metaverse displays.
00:21:45.544 - 00:22:15.020, Speaker B: Well, NFT, because, I mean, and this goes. I mean, NFTs are a financial innovation. That's really what they are. And they are not ownership. You know, they're like a cousin of ownership. They're like a proof of fandom. They're a token that you can exchange with someone and attach a price to that points to an image, but doesn't give you any specific rights over that image unless you tie, like, an actual legal contract to it.
00:22:15.092 - 00:22:15.704, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:16.444 - 00:22:20.504, Speaker B: So it's a financial innovation above all else right now.
00:22:22.044 - 00:23:35.154, Speaker A: But also, like, there's a radical piece to it where you can, in the NFT or in a contract, say, okay, I'm an artist, and every time my creation sells, I get 15% more than the first price to the last price. And so artists can actually, and their families can actually benefit from producing great works that sell five years, 1530 years, 50 years in the future, where right now, young artist makes ten awesome paintings, sells them for $3,000 each. Gallerist buys nine of them, pumps up the two, drives the price up, sells one, drives the price up, sells it, next thing you know, Gallarus makes nine times what the artist does. That doesn't seem fair to people. Kind of. The crypto revolution was all around, how do we make the world more transparent? How do we make it more egalitarian? How do we cut out the rent taker? Every single creative is looking at the space right now and looking for guidance. Very few have done what you've done, which is kind of created in the space, because you didn't create, like, it's an NFT project, it's not like an NFT.
00:23:35.154 - 00:23:36.022, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:36.078 - 00:23:38.598, Speaker B: Bitcoin is bitcoin from 2014.
00:23:38.686 - 00:23:40.274, Speaker A: Yeah. It's an ecosystem.
00:23:40.574 - 00:23:52.856, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, it's. It, you know, I don't think that there is an any earlier known case of art tokenized on the blockchain before bitchcoin?
00:23:52.920 - 00:23:58.920, Speaker A: Yeah. It reminds me more of the whale shark community to some degree.
00:23:59.032 - 00:23:59.616, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:59.760 - 00:24:02.968, Speaker A: Other than you haven't fostered that community other than your projects.
00:24:03.056 - 00:24:51.410, Speaker B: Yeah. But it's funny because at the time, you know, even though I hope now I'm a little bit more renowned, but at the time, I was, you know, completely unknown, and it got picked up by, like, wired and vice, and it was like, top article on coinspeaker, like, above Larry Summers talking about bitcoin. And so I realized I had hit on something, and I thought. I thought at the time about, like, what would it mean for me to do this with other people's artwork or with, you know, works of art that have real value? And then I remember the. I don't know. I don't remember totally the specifics, but I remember that early Dao with, like, $150 million, the dow, and the Ethereum. Yeah.
00:24:51.410 - 00:24:56.178, Speaker B: And I remember how, like, a theory I'm had to be forked. And I was like, oh, God.
00:24:56.226 - 00:24:57.346, Speaker A: Test case one for Ethereum.
00:24:57.410 - 00:25:03.522, Speaker B: Yeah, it, like, really spooked me. And I was like, okay, yeah, you.
00:25:03.538 - 00:25:11.404, Speaker A: Might have to go back and think about bitchcoin as a social token. And do you create the bitch community?
00:25:12.064 - 00:25:12.616, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:12.720 - 00:25:15.200, Speaker A: Well, how do you come up with the name bitchcoin other than being bitches?
00:25:15.272 - 00:25:43.166, Speaker B: I remember I was. Well, I remember I was, like, eating eggs when I came up with it, and I was like, this is just too good. Like, too good. Yeah. Also, like, you know, I'm a young woman, like, kind of reclaiming agency, and bitch is like a word that's aggressive, not nice. But also, you know, has been reclaimed over and over again. It's still kind of titillating.
00:25:43.166 - 00:25:43.918, Speaker B: Bitchcoin.
00:25:44.006 - 00:25:48.366, Speaker A: Well, I'm gonna go buy myself a bitchcoin. Do they trade?
00:25:48.470 - 00:26:06.672, Speaker B: So there is going to be a public auction on. It'll be announced on or May 18, and it'll take place from the 25th to the 28 May on Philips.
