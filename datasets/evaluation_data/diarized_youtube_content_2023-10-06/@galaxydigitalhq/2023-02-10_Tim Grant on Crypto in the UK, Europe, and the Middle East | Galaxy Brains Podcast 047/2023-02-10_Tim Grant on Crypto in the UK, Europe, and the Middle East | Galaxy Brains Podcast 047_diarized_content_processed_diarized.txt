00:00:07.040 - 00:01:01.018, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Research. So many nodes running on my comp that its knees hurt I'm rolling steady downloading blocks for days I'll be writing raps and ciphers even if encryption fades yo, there's more to this game than a couple jpegs I will never settle like a couple broken trade legs if you've seen my talks no, you couldn't set us back till you've seen Guy Fawkes you ain't ever met a mask never better than a rap just to set a little fire the way the words flow are like the data through a wire or the way the birds fly high above the canopy Tim Grant is here to talk. He's a member of the family, and I'm the man to beat when it comes to randomly snapping y'all hands will be clapping when intangibles rapping, my fans will be mapping the land and shouting our names.

00:01:35.920 - 00:01:36.644, Speaker B: Emia.
00:01:37.224 - 00:01:39.400, Speaker A: Oxy. Great to have you in person, Tim.
00:01:39.472 - 00:01:40.832, Speaker B: It's cracking to be back.
00:01:40.888 - 00:01:41.920, Speaker A: You live in London.
00:01:42.032 - 00:01:42.664, Speaker B: I live in London.
00:01:42.704 - 00:01:48.408, Speaker A: We have an office in London, which you oversee or look after. But you're in New York.
00:01:48.496 - 00:01:51.536, Speaker B: I mean, I love coming back. I lived here for 19 years. It feels like home.
00:01:51.600 - 00:01:55.272, Speaker A: What is this hat? I have not seen this particular piece of galaxy swag.
00:01:55.328 - 00:02:12.100, Speaker B: You know what? It's funny. I put a picture of me wearing this on LinkedIn, and it was the single biggest number of views of 2022. 35,000 people, like, viewed that particular picture. I was in Singapore. This is the limited edition galaxy trucker. House.
00:02:12.132 - 00:02:22.116, Speaker A: And it has the various, what we call the helmets, which is Galaxy's logos, the ashes helmet, and it has all the different NFT. Not all of them, but I designed this myself. It's pretty sick, dude.
00:02:22.140 - 00:02:23.868, Speaker B: I made this myself. Very hard to get.
00:02:23.916 - 00:02:43.214, Speaker A: I'm very happy to have you in general, because you're fun to have on this show. Listeners will know that Tim has been on, I think, twice prior. He's number three. But a lot has been happening in Europe. Let's start with a little bit about what is happening. I have some other questions to ask you. You've been in digital assets for a long time.
00:02:43.214 - 00:02:48.894, Speaker A: You worked at the six digital exchange, which was SDX.
00:02:48.934 - 00:02:50.274, Speaker B: Is that what it was, SDX, yeah.
00:02:50.654 - 00:02:58.774, Speaker A: And one of their big goals was tokenization. And you've still been working a lot on this. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that and some other things. But before, let's talk about Europe.
00:02:58.854 - 00:02:59.182, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:59.238 - 00:03:08.662, Speaker A: One of the things that I saw, and I haven't had the chance to really dig into is new guidance regulatory framework from the UK. What was it?
00:03:08.718 - 00:03:44.090, Speaker B: You know, so we've been. We've been waiting for this for a while, if you. If just to give a little bit of a timeline. Last April, I believe it was April 2022, was the statement made by the treasury at the time that we want to become a global crypto hub. And that was at the time, like, wow, that's a big pivot from, at best, ambivalence to maybe if you look at the FCA, a little bit of misguided negativity. And now here we are, like, what's the follow through on that? And so they've followed through, and so the way this went. And remember, we've got regime shift over there.
00:03:44.090 - 00:03:53.220, Speaker B: So we got Rishi Sunak in power, which is great, because he was really at the helm at the beginning of all of this. And so he's very pro crypto and this crypto hub store.
00:03:53.252 - 00:03:54.372, Speaker A: He was at treasury.
00:03:54.428 - 00:03:57.388, Speaker B: He was at treasury. He was the chancellor at the time.
00:03:57.476 - 00:04:00.356, Speaker A: Checker chancellor of the Exchequer, which is like the head of the treasury.
00:04:00.420 - 00:04:44.714, Speaker B: Which is the treasury. Yeah. And then we had the financial services markets bill, which kind of came towards the tail end of the year. And what that teased was the idea, which is really quite straightforward, is, well, instead of doing amica in the european play, which is, let's create an entirely adjacent, custom built regulation set for crypto, they're saying, well, why would we do that? We've got a really good regulation set for traditional assets. Let's just bring it in now. How you do it and what that implies is really important. But what's really exciting now after this, and there's actually been a lot coming out in the UK the last couple of weeks, is they've really now come out with the results of these consultations.
00:04:44.714 - 00:05:13.950, Speaker B: And the specificity is really encouraging. They're basically saying, right, let's bring it in. They're reiterating, which is important. So the message is consistent from the treasury and to some extent from the FCA. And there's a lot of discussion, by the way, in the UK about the influence of politicians on the FCA. That's a live discussion. But what this, I think, signals is actually a very sensible approach to bringing this all into the regulatory perimeter.
00:05:13.950 - 00:05:43.106, Speaker B: So the implication of that is that, effectively, if you want to be where I am, until now, you really had no certainty. If you want to do crypto asset business, yes, there's a crypto asset register for AML that will go away. You just go and get registered like you would do anything else. Now, there's some open questions, but it does cover custody, which is really key. They've thought about this stuff. It's all very logical. It also covers people, and this is quite important subtlety.
00:05:43.106 - 00:06:37.966, Speaker B: People who want to do business with people in the UK, from outside the UK. It's very encouraging to hear the consistent refrain of, we're going to make this work. And also, there's this element of the definition of an asset, which I teased, I think, on the last time I was on, which is to define a digital asset in a way that actually makes sense. There isn't a definition of one in the UK, but the law Commission, which is quite a powerful sort of body in the UK, has been talking about this for a while, and we actually. We talked about it with the treasury directly. They're getting to a point of making this definition of what they call an asset in motion and a digital asset versus a debt type instrument, like it's coming to fruition. So what does this all mean in terms of people doing crypto business in the UK? I think your level of certainty and clarity and the direction is now much higher than it was a couple of weeks ago.
00:06:38.070 - 00:07:21.520, Speaker A: I love that. Super interesting when you. When you say that they are going to. Instead of working through a bespoke framework for crypto and for digital assets, like Micah did, like some of the comprehensive regulatory proposals that have been made in the US, so, like Lumis Gillibrand or Stabenow Boseman, Boozman. There's sort of these two ideas, right? Like does crypto need its own regulatory framework or can it fit inside the existing one? And when I hear you say that they're putting bringing to the existing one eyes and American get nervous because that is what, that's primarily like, say what Gary Gensler at the SEC has said. He said 99.9% of these are securities.
00:07:21.520 - 00:07:58.256, Speaker A: We have robust securities laws, bring it all into the securities framework. But then the SEC hasn't yet done the work to actually make that feasible from a practical standpoint. Were that even true, which I don't think it is true on, on how many of them are securities. But for example, the custody rule at the SEC hasn't been updated to handle crypto. Um, reg ATS hasn't really been updated or thought about, about how, where these could trade. Were they securities? Right. Uh, Finra hasn't rulemade about broker dealer activity in crypto securities.
00:07:58.256 - 00:08:10.126, Speaker A: Right. So like bringing it into the framework, you know, I'm doing air quotes for those that are listening and not watching on YouTube. Has, could be very negative, could be negative. But you're saying they've thought through all those particulars.
00:08:10.230 - 00:08:28.110, Speaker B: It feels like it's not a negress. Like that's an aggressive stance, as we all know in the US. And it's, you know, the general view is not a good one. This feels like the opposite. This feels like it's a benign, positive, constructive way to bring it in without creating more barriers to entry.
00:08:28.182 - 00:08:28.958, Speaker A: Very interesting.
00:08:29.046 - 00:08:55.120, Speaker B: Which I think is a net positive. Now there are a couple of things to iron out. The Defi question still isn't resolved, but that's understandable. Baby steps, things like clearing and settlement, minting, staking, they've all got a little bit of work to do. But the general signal, I think, to the market that, hey, implicitly it's saying that we believe in this as an asset class and they're not taking a stance, it's not hosting.
00:08:55.152 - 00:09:01.330, Speaker A: You're pretty confident that what issues there are, are going to be worked out or attempted to be worked out in good faith.
00:09:01.442 - 00:09:25.666, Speaker B: It feels that way. And look, we talk with the FCA, and our conversations, frankly, with the FCA have been very constructive. They're very open, they have a genuine two way dialogue. And the last point on the UK to make is, which actually brings the FCA into play, is this UK ETF question. So if you look at the global landscape, the two big holdouts are the UK and the US, which are the.
00:09:25.690 - 00:09:28.498, Speaker A: Biggest and among the biggest capital markets in the world.
00:09:28.666 - 00:10:04.624, Speaker B: I think they're the first and second biggest ETF markets on the planet, and they're the two that are holdouts. I think what we might see in the coming months is, and it would take a very small rule, tweak by the FCA to allow this. And maybe it's London Stock Exchange getting involved, which would be great. Maybe they beat the US to the ETF, the flow goes there, which would be natural. It's not like Canada or Brazil or Germany or Switzerland, where there are ETF's. We run some of those in Canada and Brazil. That's still not going to attract a certain buyer base.
00:10:04.624 - 00:10:08.864, Speaker B: Right. You really need it to be in the grown up us or UK, the big capital market.
00:10:08.984 - 00:10:09.208, Speaker A: Let's see.
00:10:09.216 - 00:10:10.376, Speaker B: Let's watch out for that this year.
00:10:10.440 - 00:10:30.282, Speaker A: Okay, before we move on to some other topics, what else in european developments and not just in regulatory. I don't know if you want to talk about mica. We've written about this plenty, so if we don't want to talk about it, we know it's in progress. That is the sort of bespoke european crypto regulatory framework. Yes, it's progressing. I don't know if we have to spend a lot of time on it.
00:10:30.298 - 00:10:42.626, Speaker B: But no quick two cent on that. Look, it is progressing. It's rather comically stuck in translation, because then you translate into the 24 or 27 languages or whatever it is. So they literally delayed it.
00:10:42.770 - 00:10:44.922, Speaker A: Passed by the European Commission. Right.
00:10:45.058 - 00:11:01.068, Speaker B: So it's got a whole set of steps it needs to go through. My understanding is what happens next around April time is this. All the translations come through, it passes into this sort of register, and then the hard work begins of actually drafting the very specific rules.
00:11:01.156 - 00:11:27.152, Speaker A: So funny. Dude, there's nothing. I've looked back in your life, european, Europe wide, eurozone like legislative process. And, like, it's harder to figure out than like, it almost. It's like I'm reading it in different language. It makes you actually very bullish on things in the US, like Congress, dot gov and C SPAN, which actually make it very easy to figure out what the current state of a legislation is in the US. But yes, it's progressing.
00:11:27.208 - 00:11:46.032, Speaker B: It's progressing. And look, I think that the current betting is maybe 2024, probably more likely 2025, but that's a short enough time horizon, and the progress is sufficiently clear in how it will progress, even if it's a bit bureaucratic, that I think it's also a net positive for Europe.
00:11:46.128 - 00:11:48.120, Speaker A: Businesses can start to plan for it.
00:11:48.232 - 00:12:12.672, Speaker B: Exactly. And people are, and we are. If it's that tighter time horizon, you should be planning your post mecha cross european ability to do business. That's going to change the complexion and landscape in a very positive way. So I think the net story for Europe, UK and Europe and Switzerland is. It's still positive. The adoption story is still on course.
00:12:12.672 - 00:12:23.882, Speaker B: FTX didn't really seem to have a massive effect on that. From what we tell with institutions, this sort of legislation and this sort of clarity basically gives everybody confidence to steam on.
00:12:23.938 - 00:12:29.826, Speaker A: That's great. Okay, maybe just in Europe, Middle East, Africa, in Asia.
00:12:29.890 - 00:12:30.866, Speaker B: Talk about Middle East a bit.
00:12:30.930 - 00:12:32.794, Speaker A: Yeah. What's interesting to you in these regions?
00:12:32.834 - 00:13:17.490, Speaker B: Well, firstly, you know, what's interesting is that I think everybody's realized now, like, the view of the Middle east has to change a little bit. It always had this view of like, well, when the oil prices was high, they had a lot of money and people would just fly in and fly out and go and ask for loads of money. And sure enough, back in 2008 at the last, that financial crisis, they did bail out and they did invest in a bunch of banks and stuff like that. They were seen as a less sophisticated at the time. I think what's now happened is, yes, they're flush with cash again. And this is material amount of cash they've got from the oil prices. We're talking like Saudi for years, Abu Dhabi, they have very full coffers, but they're no longer the less sophisticated or viewed as less sophisticated.
00:13:17.490 - 00:13:19.482, Speaker B: These guys are very sophisticated and they're.
00:13:19.498 - 00:13:21.602, Speaker A: Very diversified, much more diversified than they've.
00:13:21.618 - 00:13:34.870, Speaker B: Been in the past and more than people think. You know, they're genuinely thinking about the post oil situation for their economies. They're very digitally forward Saudis. There's some statistic, I believe, that they're the youngest sort of most computer, literally most online.
00:13:34.942 - 00:13:40.398, Speaker A: I've seen that. And also they have this fat. What's that thing? The wall? The wall city. Have you seen that thing?
00:13:40.446 - 00:13:40.966, Speaker B: The line?
00:13:41.070 - 00:13:47.398, Speaker A: The line, yeah. Yo, it's sick. I hope they do build it. It's kind of ridiculous, but it's also like ambitious in a big city.
00:13:47.406 - 00:13:55.216, Speaker B: People said that about certain things in Dubai. And you go to Dubai now, which I'm gonna be there on Friday. And they built it and it all functions. And the palm got built and everybody's.
00:13:55.240 - 00:13:59.880, Speaker A: Living on the Palm islands. And there's one that looks like the globe. No, but they actually did it.
00:13:59.912 - 00:14:00.864, Speaker B: They built these things.
00:14:00.984 - 00:14:01.744, Speaker A: It's pretty sick.
00:14:01.824 - 00:14:33.952, Speaker B: It's really cool. So that's the first thing. Like, don't see them as that old sort of dynamic. Like, this is a very smart economy over there, and they have lots of money, and they are extremely pro and open arms on and being sensible about crypto and digital assets. There's obviously a huge community down there, and it's growing. The Dubai regime, the Vara regime, which has just been taken over by our company friend Henson, also. He's just announced yesterday that he's going to quadruple his staff, so they're taking it deadly seriously.
00:14:33.952 - 00:14:57.866, Speaker B: Abu Dhabi, which is like, I think it's the second or third biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world, so make no mistake, there's a lot of firepower there. They're leaning in. Some of the biggest hedge funds in the world have ended up there. Some of the big crypto companies have ended up there. We'll be down there as well. I think that's one to watch over the next few years, because they have the influence now globally. Yeah.
00:14:57.866 - 00:14:58.890, Speaker B: They will invest in.
00:14:59.002 - 00:15:31.174, Speaker A: I was going to say, too, just geopolitically. There's been a whole bunch of this. I don't want to. This isn't galaxy's view, but my view on the history of geopolitics and the east west battle, which has played out multiple ways in the Middle east for years. I mean, obviously, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, by the way, then the Americans invaded Afghanistan. So there's parts that have been sort of up for grabs geopolitically by the major powers. Saudi has long been a us ally, but also, like, has become more independent lately, there's been some.
00:15:31.174 - 00:16:01.686, Speaker A: They've done a great job, and in the Middle east, particularly in the peninsula, really becoming almost like a neutral, a pretty neutral globally, does business with everyone. Right. I mean, in some cases, to the chagrin of, like, their us allies or their russian allies. Right. They do business with maybe both. But it makes a lot of sense, I think, for there to be a lot of global crypto activity there, given that crypto itself is global and decentralized and non sovereign.
00:16:01.750 - 00:16:23.674, Speaker B: Well, and they believe. What's really exciting for us in the crypto industry is they believe in where it's going, and they're positioning for that. They've got huge mining outfits in Abu Dhabi. So they fundamentally, from the top down, believing where this is all going. They want to position themselves to have a large, literate workforce. They want to. People talk about living in Abu Dhabi in very different terms than they did ten years ago.
00:16:23.674 - 00:16:42.942, Speaker B: It's a great place to live for families. So let's assume that that's going to take a bigger role than people would think in the next decade or so. And they have, remember, large pools of assets. When we talk about tokenization, in a minute that matters. They're going to be in a very strong position to tokenize large amounts of stuff.
00:16:42.998 - 00:16:50.198, Speaker A: Yeah. And let's go into that because we've talked about tokenization. You and I both offline, I think we've talked about on this podcast before, too.
00:16:50.246 - 00:16:50.834, Speaker B: Yes.
00:16:51.334 - 00:17:28.534, Speaker A: Just to, I guess, catch our viewers up. If you haven't heard me talk about this, I have been very interested in tokenization for a long time, but I've yet to see a real durable use case actually emerge, really, outside of stablecoins, which is tokenization. Um, tons of proofs of concept that are interesting. Banks have done it, international banks, brokerages have done something, JPM did something, SoC Gen's done something right. People have done stuff, but nothing's really caught on outside of like stable coins on public blockchains. Where, where do you, is that still true? And also, where do you see the space go?
00:17:28.574 - 00:17:48.410, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, look, tokenization is a, it's a fascinating debate and it's a fascinating movement. And I've kind of had to, I've been on my own journey with it because I've been talking about and dealing with tokenizing for like seven, eight years now. And I, and I did, you know, run hello to all my former colleagues at SDX. So I ran SDX, which that was.
00:17:48.442 - 00:18:06.442, Speaker A: One of the big, I think they were also doing pure cryptos. But that was one of the big arguments for SDX. I mean, I met the folks there. I don't think I met you, but you were there. I was in Zurich and met a bunch of people at six, like in 2019 talking about this exact topic.
00:18:06.498 - 00:18:33.594, Speaker B: Yeah. And the assumption was that we'd be tokenizing all bonds. And of course, the truth is, and this is your point, look, through all this time, where have we actually gotten, are we actually tokenizing bonds, equities, funds, the hundreds of trillions of capital markets, assets? That's the exciting prize. Can we take the best tools that Defi can and blockchain can give us and apply them for a better, faster, cheaper way of doing all these things?
00:18:33.714 - 00:18:44.130, Speaker A: Because I think there are clear arguments. If we set aside. Totally. Yeah. If we set aside some of the intricacies which are important, you can't set aside. That's probably why they're, it hasn't happened yet. But for example, just purely settlement.
00:18:44.130 - 00:18:53.730, Speaker A: Like we know. I mean, look at stable coins. Moving a dollar with a stable coin is like just orders of magnitude better than basically all existing hodgepodge of fiat payment.
00:18:53.802 - 00:19:49.964, Speaker B: And that's the key, right? Like this is about, this is about collateralization, it's about settlement, it's about repo. Like these are the things in the background that make global capital markets function. And so what I, and I remember, I think I talked about this the first time I was on, I called that we should be paying attention to this. And sure enough, the back half of 2022, to your point, every man and their dog, Blackrock State street wisdom tree, UBS, JP Morgan, the list is long of HSBC did a bunch of these things they've done right. UBS did a 300 185 million swiss franc bond with SDX as an example. Like not small. But the point is now, I think the collective consciousness has reached a critical moment where every, there is no big financial institution, buy side or sell side, who doesn't believe that this is where it's going? Public statements made by the biggest CEO's in this space.
00:19:50.084 - 00:19:54.394, Speaker A: Even Jamie Dimon, who I talked, I had to give some.
00:19:54.524 - 00:19:55.246, Speaker B: A rebuke.
00:19:55.310 - 00:20:05.190, Speaker A: A rebuke. I thank you. I did a hearty rebuke of his anti bitcoin comments. But of course, even in that clip, we said it two weeks ago, he said, oh, we're actually doing tons of stuff in blockchain.
00:20:05.222 - 00:20:06.334, Speaker B: You mentioned they repo stuff.
00:20:06.374 - 00:20:11.598, Speaker A: He said intraday repo, which apparently you can't actually do, which is a big deal, but you can with blockchain.
00:20:11.726 - 00:20:19.830, Speaker B: They're legitimately doing that stuff now. And you know, remember they did the project Guardian in Singapore where they actually did some really interesting. I saw that defi activity.
00:20:19.902 - 00:20:27.854, Speaker A: They were like tokenizing like dollar deposits on a permissioned version of AAve and lending against it.
00:20:28.394 - 00:21:18.618, Speaker B: That's impressive to see them doing that. But the big question is, where do we go from here? I think what we're about to see, and this is the part that most people even in our industry don't understand. In the background, all of these big institutions have been building pieces of the repo, tokenizing repo settlement margin capabilities, tokenized money in terms of finality, which we won't go into today, which is really interesting. Zero risk weighted assets which sort of pseudo CBDC, but not quite working with the central banks like these things are actually now going to start to come together into a functioning market. And what I'm terming the minimum viable digital capital market is really upon us. So my prediction for 2023 is we get to the end and we're actually talking about the opening up of these markets, albeit slowly, but make no mistake, there's a lot of money going into this, a lot of attention.
00:21:18.666 - 00:21:30.742, Speaker A: Yeah, fascinating. What other you were talking, you mentioned talking about structured products to me before. What do you want to tell us about that? Because first of all, what is a structured product, quote unquote separately?
00:21:30.838 - 00:21:58.146, Speaker B: I think this is really important. I think hopefully this would be interesting for all of our viewers and listeners in any functioning market asset class over time. What you get is you get the spot, then you get the derivatives market, which ends up being multiples of size of the spot market, and the vast wealth in the world, which is high net worth. So all the UBS wealth management, which is something like 3 trillion, I think.
00:21:58.210 - 00:21:58.698, Speaker A: Really?
00:21:58.826 - 00:22:33.996, Speaker B: Yeah, bananas. And like all the trillions that are being managed by these large houses, bank of America warehouse and Morgan Stanley, et cetera, et cetera, they're all managing these assets. And one of the biggest markets for individuals to get exposure to these asset classes is through structured products. It's basically, I buy something, it's a bankable security, it's got an icing on it, I put it in my portfolio, flows through all the systems, but it gives me a payoff and maybe I want a juiced up payoff, maybe I want capital protection, maybe I want some leverage embedded in there. Maybe you can get really exotic on.
00:22:34.020 - 00:22:49.272, Speaker A: How you literally like it. I don't want to say that, I'm going to say token, but it's basically a piece of paper, an agreement with an issuer, but that could be, this is a bitcoin two x note, or it's a, it could be whatever it wants, right? It could be part loan, part equity.
00:22:49.328 - 00:22:53.976, Speaker B: Part derivative, all kinds of, you just simplify it and then you buy it.
00:22:54.000 - 00:23:02.088, Speaker A: Like I can do that trade as a buyer of the note myself, but gosh, like, let's say the thing is like, you know, two x long bitcoin, two x short gold. Yeah.
00:23:02.136 - 00:23:03.056, Speaker B: And it's all, then I have to.
00:23:03.080 - 00:23:07.232, Speaker A: Like figure out how to actually put that trade on myself better. If I could just buy a structured product.
00:23:07.328 - 00:23:10.304, Speaker B: I just go to my UBS wealth management advisor.
00:23:10.424 - 00:23:12.750, Speaker A: But here's the thing I want, boom, you sell it.
00:23:12.782 - 00:23:39.926, Speaker B: Now, why is that so important? The derivatives that underlie all those structured products is huge. Now for the big picture, take, step back for the big picture story of crypto adoption globally. One of the really important frontiers is that those big wealth management networks are going to want to be able to offer that up to their clients. Now, we know for a fact that all of those clients have been asking for this, but the banks have really been uncertain how to satisfy.
00:23:39.990 - 00:23:46.012, Speaker A: They don't have, the big traditional banks don't have. They don't trade it. That they don't trade it. So they actually can't build it.
00:23:46.068 - 00:24:02.636, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So what we're on the cusp of, and here at Galaxy, we're working really hard on this, is actually creating that link because we are probably the biggest derivs market maker in the world in crypto. And you had Jason on recently. Jason runs that group. Yeah.
00:24:02.660 - 00:24:04.164, Speaker A: When he's not trading his rail cars.
00:24:04.204 - 00:24:39.548, Speaker B: And when he's not doing his cattle cars and all this stuff that he does, the positioning to allow that crypto risk to be wrapped and distributed. Love that. This is, this is, and we're not the only game in town by any stretch. But, but I'm highlighting it because this is like, we'll look back on this as another moment and especially as we're coming through, you know, this, this macro economic situation. At some point we're going to feel like we're off, we're off to the races again. And we saw in January always happens, as soon as you get some positive price action, the demand for these things goes up. Oh, I want, I want a piece of that action.
00:24:39.636 - 00:24:50.460, Speaker A: So I think this is really interesting for the audience to know that. And what you're predicting here is that there is a majority, mostly untapped market for a new product in crypto that's.
00:24:50.492 - 00:25:14.852, Speaker B: Been demanded and partially untapped. But most of those people went and got some exposure somewhere. But when that becomes institutionalized, when we can work with a UBS investment bank and actually be the hedge of the derivatives in the back end, and they package it up with a wrapper with their risk in it and give it to their clients, and they do that in size. And at Morgan Stanley and Bank of.
00:25:14.868 - 00:25:18.244, Speaker A: America, it's a lot easier for large numbers of people to get at.
00:25:18.404 - 00:25:24.924, Speaker B: We'll see that, that flow into the derivatives market that then gives us, you know, another big step forward. Cracking star.
00:25:24.964 - 00:25:48.088, Speaker A: All right, we're almost out of time, but before. This has been fascinating, by the way. But before we wrap here, Tim, I've got to ask you, last time you were on the podcast, I had given you and all members of the British Commonwealth condolences on the passing of her Majesty the Queen. You've now have formerly Prince Charles you've got King Charles. He's now been in there for not a whole year, what, six months or something?
00:25:48.136 - 00:25:49.204, Speaker B: A few months, yeah.
00:25:49.984 - 00:25:56.184, Speaker A: First of all, how's Charles doing, in your opinion, as my random emissary from the.
00:25:56.264 - 00:26:14.830, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, it's very divisive. Right. And I don't think he's been particularly visible. His coronation is in May, so we get a day off, which is exciting. But look, I think that we were talking about this offline before, you know, Harry has come in. I'm just gonna say I'm on Team Harry.
00:26:14.942 - 00:26:17.314, Speaker A: I'm also on Team Harry. We'll talk about this.
00:26:18.054 - 00:26:39.462, Speaker B: I've always been a bit questionable about the monarchy in general, but you have to love the queen and her approach. One of the greatest reigns in monarchy history. But post Queen Elizabeth, we've now got a dicey King Charles and a messed up family. We've got a messed up dynamic. I haven't really, without her at the.
00:26:39.478 - 00:26:47.662, Speaker A: Top, messed up the whole time, but without her as that anchor on top, it kind of, like, pulls the veneer off the whole thing, and you're like, wow, actually, this whole thing's, like, pretty messed up.
00:26:47.758 - 00:26:52.398, Speaker B: It's not. I wonder if he would have published that book had she still been around. Probably not.
00:26:52.486 - 00:27:24.604, Speaker A: I think probably not, too. But one of the things that struck me about Harry's book, and I've only read about a quarter of it myself, but I've certainly read plenty about what's been written about it. Actually, my wife is reading our copy of the book. So as soon as you finish that, babe, I'm gonna pick that one up and read the rest of it. Um, you basically have to believe. I mean, there's plenty of pretty shocking allegations that Harry makes. And while some might be overblown, no doubt, or whatever, you basically have to believe Harry's a liar in order to not be very mad about this institution right now, 100%.
00:27:25.064 - 00:27:27.032, Speaker B: He can't be making it all up.
00:27:27.208 - 00:27:31.768, Speaker A: It's just his own dad leaked his emails to the tabloids despite him in the press.
00:27:31.856 - 00:27:32.312, Speaker B: And that's.
00:27:32.368 - 00:27:32.688, Speaker A: That's.
00:27:32.736 - 00:27:56.064, Speaker B: That's the sort of the vibe is when you read it and you hear about all this stuff, you don't. You're not. You're not so shocked. You're kind of like, yeah, that all kind of checks out based on kind of what we. The vibe we've been getting for the last 30 years. So it's kind of harsh. But, you know, I will support Harry because what he's really trying to do is promote the idea of being open, being vulnerable.
00:27:56.064 - 00:28:01.460, Speaker B: No question some of it might be a little bit overblown. Did he have to take digs at his bottom? Would have been quite true.
00:28:01.492 - 00:28:11.598, Speaker A: Did he have to come all the way out and say it? But he's had a, you know, people think, oh, my God, he's a prince. Don't feel bad for him. You know, it's. Life's been easy. Well, yeah. He hasn't been like, you know, homeless.
00:28:11.646 - 00:28:12.334, Speaker B: That's pretty horrible.
00:28:12.374 - 00:28:23.206, Speaker A: But, yeah, basically it sounds awful. Cause the queen, what she had set up as this ideal for the monarchy was do nothing. Basically, don't be a person. Deperson, hood yourself.
00:28:23.310 - 00:28:23.718, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:23.806 - 00:28:24.078, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:24.126 - 00:28:24.902, Speaker B: For the good of the story from.
00:28:24.918 - 00:28:29.030, Speaker A: The beginning, which was, I mean, truly a sacrifice and an honorable one that she made.
00:28:29.102 - 00:28:29.358, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:29.406 - 00:28:31.622, Speaker A: But it's not clear that that's how it has to be done.
00:28:31.678 - 00:28:32.046, Speaker B: Totally.
00:28:32.110 - 00:28:34.546, Speaker A: But it was done to them and they were kids and they were kids.
00:28:34.610 - 00:28:40.202, Speaker B: And so good luck to Harry and all of that. And by the way, happy birthday.
00:28:40.298 - 00:28:47.834, Speaker A: Oh, thank you, my friend. Tim Grant, head of Europe, Middle east and Africa for Galaxy Digital. Thank you for being in New York today. Great to see you, my friend.
