00:00:00.160 - 00:00:06.838, Speaker B: You're well known for being a big patron of the bail project, right? What is that? What other criminal justice issues are you into? I know this is a bit of an aside.
00:00:06.886 - 00:00:49.696, Speaker A: Let me tell you one point. At one point, crypto and bail were two of the most unpopular subjects in America. I was like, how did I pick those two? Listen, stepping back, we have a criminal justice system that is not just, that is not fair, that's not economic, that's not moral. And as I stumbled into it, just literally, because my daughter was working for the Bronx defenders in the summer and started talking about what she was seeing, and I got more involved, and I made a bunch of money in Ethereum in 2017 and decided to put some of it to philanthropic use. I just got more angry. And so I am the chairman of the board of the bail project. We're the largest bail organization in America.
00:00:49.696 - 00:00:57.144, Speaker A: We both are a direct service. We've bailed out over 30,000 people, and we've been working to change the laws.
