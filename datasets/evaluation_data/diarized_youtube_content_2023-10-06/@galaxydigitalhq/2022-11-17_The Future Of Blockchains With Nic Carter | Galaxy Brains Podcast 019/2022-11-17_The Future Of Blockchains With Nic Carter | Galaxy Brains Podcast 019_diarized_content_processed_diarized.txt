Welcome to Galaxy Brains, the weekly podcast from Galaxy Digital Research. As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, and we have a very exciting, exciting episode today. Our first external guest on this podcast, Galaxy Brains, my friend, Nick Carter from Castle Island Ventures. Nick, how are you? Welcome.
00:00:41.510 - 00:00:46.150, Speaker B: I'm very excited to be here. Thank you, Alex. I'm glad. I'm excited. You have a podcast now.
00:00:46.182 - 00:00:46.662, Speaker A: I know.
00:00:46.758 - 00:00:47.326, Speaker B: That's great.
00:00:47.390 - 00:00:50.102, Speaker A: I've just been listening to yours for three and a half years now.
00:00:50.198 - 00:00:55.014, Speaker B: Inshallah, you shall replace on the brink as the leading crypto podcast.
00:00:55.094 - 00:01:06.396, Speaker A: You hear that, Matt? Nick's calling for it right now. Matt Walsh, make it. You got to step aside. Give up the throne. I also have Christine Kim, as always, from Galaxy Digital Research. Hey, Christine.
00:01:06.460 - 00:01:07.544, Speaker C: Hello. Hello.
00:01:07.924 - 00:01:13.044, Speaker A: And we have our friend Bim net Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading, as always, as well. What's up, Bim?
00:01:13.124 - 00:01:14.284, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:01:14.404 - 00:01:44.716, Speaker A: So we're not going to do talk about a ton of news. Specifically, we're really going to talk with Nick and have a general conversation this episode about bitcoin and crypto and markets. But before we dive deep into that bim net, we just had a, you know, a rip roaring day. ETH was up huge yesterday, but bitcoin followed strongly today. Um, it feels good being up 20% over a two, three day period. You know, if you round tripped your. If you bought bitcoin at 69,000, then you're still down pretty bad today.
00:01:44.716 - 00:01:50.476, Speaker A: But if you. But we're up a lot. I mean, what's happening? What are you seeing from your seat? Looking at markets?
00:01:50.540 - 00:02:44.288, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it kind of seemed like you had the perfect culmination of, like, all the bad news priced into markets, and it sort of left us in a position where the path of least resistance was higher, and you had this sort of liquidity situation where there's a lot of shorts, a lot of illiquidity, and you just had sort of gappy price action. So taking a step back, we had inflation last week that printed a record nine one. People got super pessimistic. They sold stocks, sold crypto, and we've been moving higher ever since. On the equity side, earnings expectations are about as bearish as you can possibly get. Most of the street side analysts that I talk to expect that in line results for most of the large cap tech companies would actually be bullish. And you're basically at trend lows.
00:02:44.288 - 00:03:33.774, Speaker D: And then in terms of recession expectations, they're still at the highs. Twos tens is inverted at neg 20. You're pricing in looking at, depending on what model you look at, lots of people are forecasting anywhere from a 60% to 80% probability of a recession within the next year. So all in all, it seemed like everybody got peak bearishness and then you had sort of some sort of constructive news come out and the market just sort of started to rip higher. And I think you're in a position where ETH and BTC can actually extend even more just because we haven't spent that much time here in terms of bitcoin's price action. Right. You basically went from 29,000 to 20,000 without spending much time in between.
00:03:33.774 - 00:03:49.154, Speaker D: And so I think that there's pretty good case to be made for bitcoin going back to 28,000 for ETH to go back to two k, or at least break through resistance. And I think, Christine, all credit to ETH folks out there.
00:03:50.174 - 00:03:51.342, Speaker C: Constructive news.
00:03:51.478 - 00:03:55.166, Speaker D: Well, one, it was, I think Celsius was done selling.
00:03:55.230 - 00:03:55.526, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:55.590 - 00:04:08.438, Speaker D: That was pretty constructive. And so people weren't afraid of the steeth ETH peg giving way. And you also had that dev call. I think people started to, at least on crypto Twitter, hype that up a little bit.
00:04:08.566 - 00:04:12.302, Speaker A: Discreteness around the merge being activated around specific dates.
00:04:12.478 - 00:04:24.280, Speaker D: Yep, exactly. And then stocks were trading incredibly well at that time, too. And so when you have good news and you have illiquidity and you got a lot of levered shorts in the.
00:04:24.312 - 00:04:27.352, Speaker A: Market or sellers are kind of gone, it looks like at the moment.
00:04:27.528 - 00:05:16.064, Speaker D: And now you have forced buying, you went from insane forced selling, huge deleveraging on the long side to the exact opposite. And so I think there's probably still more forced buying left. I think if you talk to at least my contacts amongst the crypto native community, I think people are still underweight or a little on the short side, and same thing in equities as well. And so the pain trade in this market for the summer is really higher. And I think if you just taking a step back, bitcoin had this huge run to 69k, then it came down to, in your mind, that is sort of the range that bitcoin is going to be in at 20k or 24k, it seems pretty asymmetric.
00:05:16.104 - 00:05:19.392, Speaker A: It shouldn't be a little higher, right? Somewhere closer to the middle of that range.
00:05:19.488 - 00:05:20.088, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:05:20.176 - 00:05:22.684, Speaker A: That's our fundamental valuation analysis by the way.
00:05:23.424 - 00:06:09.986, Speaker D: Absolutely. And then the last thing I sort of want to leave you guys with, which is the biggest, most high level analysis that we can get to, is central bank policy has basically driven price action in all markets and uncertainty around that central bank response function has driven a lot of price action. And I think what you've seen over the past week or two is that uncertainty come down meaningfully. People are now firmly of the view that inflation has peaked. You've seen a lot of data rollover, breakevens roll over, oil roll over, a bunch of other commodity prices roll over. And you've seen things like the VIX, which is a gauge on future volatility of the s and P in terms of expectations move a lot lower. You've had us fixed income volatility move a lot lower.
00:06:09.986 - 00:06:22.722, Speaker D: So there's a lot more certainty in the market. And when there's a lot more certainty in the market, I think the drift in the market is just naturally higher just because of how much capital there is and how much unallocated capital there is.
00:06:22.818 - 00:06:40.890, Speaker A: Love that. Great overview. I don't know, anybody have stuff they want to say on this or questions. I mean that's really easy for me to comprehend. It does feel like the, for selling is mostly over. Certainly the. I don't know, but I don't think there's another like three ac or Celsius out there shoe to drop.
00:06:40.890 - 00:06:45.458, Speaker A: It doesn't feel like there is. And we've got some others like more.
00:06:45.506 - 00:06:52.178, Speaker D: Drawn out selling, you know, bankruptcy proceedings for, for three ac and a couple other entities. But that's going to be methodical and.
00:06:52.266 - 00:06:53.442, Speaker A: Slow and longer term.
00:06:53.498 - 00:06:54.906, Speaker B: And longer term, I don't think they'll.
00:06:54.930 - 00:07:04.002, Speaker A: Take as long as Mount Gox because that's partly a peculiar peculiarities of the japanese bankruptcy system. But still, I mean we know it's.
00:07:04.098 - 00:07:09.974, Speaker C: Not soon, right, but generally. So bim, you think we've hit bottom, that this is up from here.
00:07:12.834 - 00:07:34.134, Speaker D: With reasonable confidence? I do think that we've sort of bottomed for the year and I would trade that accordingly. I think there's lots of creative ways to express this view and optionality where you're not risking too much on the downside and where you have a lot of convexity to the upside.
00:07:34.254 - 00:07:34.542, Speaker B: Speaker one.
00:07:34.558 - 00:07:43.078, Speaker A: Yeah, it's hard to know. And there's a bunch of weird stuff that can still happen. I'm always talking about, you know, there's war, there's pandemics, there's famines. These are actually not jokes. They're happening.
00:07:43.166 - 00:07:43.590, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:07:43.622 - 00:08:00.790, Speaker A: And that, yeah, but we've priced a lot of this in at the moment. It feels like it was scarier two, three months ago, Russia, Ukraine was scarier for markets. Don't get me wrong, it's a serious and scary thing that's happening there still. But from a market standpoint, we've digested this absolutely.
00:08:00.902 - 00:08:19.510, Speaker D: The one thing I would sort of leave you all with in terms of risks to consider is that to our point last week, people are insanely bad at predicting inflation. Right. The major risk to the market right now and to central banks and whatnot is really upside surprises in inflation.
00:08:19.582 - 00:08:21.278, Speaker A: It just keeps going higher, keeps going higher.
00:08:21.366 - 00:09:00.214, Speaker D: Some sort of energy, another energy crisis, wars, et cetera. And I really do think that people should be focused on inflation data, at least for the next three months or the balance of the year. But that is a very acute risk to the market. And the other risk that goes hand in hand with that is the Fed keeps financial conditions incredibly tight for longer than what the market expects. So those are the risks. But in my head, it seems like bitcoin's found a floor at 18. To responses to some of these edge scenarios.
00:09:00.214 - 00:09:03.006, Speaker D: There's actually more monetary easing, loosening of.
00:09:03.030 - 00:09:06.166, Speaker A: Financial divisions, sometimes for financial assets or risk assets.
00:09:06.230 - 00:09:13.950, Speaker D: Exactly, exactly. So I am bullish here, and that is a refreshing, let's go. For me to say several weeks ago.
00:09:13.982 - 00:09:24.098, Speaker A: I asked for one positive thing about the market and Bimnet was literally speechless. Had nothing to say. That's on a podcast that we previously did. I forget what number, but it's called bear market update on our feed if you're listening.
00:09:24.186 - 00:09:27.534, Speaker D: And I will have to say the market did go a lot lower from that.
00:09:30.034 - 00:09:40.834, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks for the overview. We're all going to just chill. I mean, we're sitting in a room together. It's great to have Nick here. It's also great for all four of us to be in New York. We don't usually do this live, all of us live, but it's great to have everyone welcome.
00:09:40.834 - 00:09:53.334, Speaker A: Nick, how's it going? You just got back from vacation. I was joking that I don't know what superlatives I can say about you that will, the bitcoiners will take umbrage with. But is it true that you're both vaccinated and vegan now?
00:09:54.594 - 00:09:56.418, Speaker B: And I handed him my guns.
00:09:56.506 - 00:09:57.146, Speaker A: No way.
00:09:57.250 - 00:10:03.894, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. You know, buybacks. Yeah, I got four shots. And in one week, you know, I had to catch up.
00:10:04.714 - 00:10:35.084, Speaker A: The boosties, is that what you call them? Sorry, we're just joking for our listeners. Because Nick the bitcoin maximalist took umbrage with Nick because of an investment you made out of Castle island ventures, your venture fund with. Now that used to be just you and Matt Walsh, but now you have several partners there that wasn't a bitcoin investment. I think they didn't realize that you've been investing in the crypto and blockchain ecosystem for years. Also a founder of Coinmetrix, which is a multi coin data platform.
00:10:35.204 - 00:10:55.584, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it was that investment specifically. I think there's all these little. These power struggles happening in sort of bitcoin influencer land, I would say. Not that I set out to be one or anything thing. And it was a little opportunistic, which is like, okay, here's a non bitcoin thing that Nick did. Let's use it as a wedge issue.
00:10:55.924 - 00:11:00.932, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it's possible to really love bitcoin, but also think other things are interesting.
00:11:01.028 - 00:11:17.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's the default. Yeah, I mean, I try and be data driven. Try and be data driven. So let's look at the data. Let's see what's happening. That was the whole point of coin metrics, right back in 2017 when that began. Where is the economic activity happening? Think of a blockchain.
00:11:17.460 - 00:11:34.584, Speaker B: Like a little country, like a small nation. Let's just look at the macroeconomic statistics. That was the whole point. And if you look at that data today, it's a fact that there's plenty of activity elsewhere on the blockchain's meaningful activity. It's not just a loser. It's not fake. It's not all scams.
00:11:34.584 - 00:11:43.880, Speaker B: Where are all the stable coins? Stable coins. You can't really deny that that's a useful use of blockchains. Where are the stable coins? They're not on bitcoin, I'll tell you that.
00:11:43.992 - 00:12:08.996, Speaker A: Yeah, I looked at the omni BTC, the. Sorry, the Omni tether. The tethers that are issued on bitcoin's omni layer, which uses, like, opera turn to put arbitrary data to move that. And, like, there is still a tiny amount, but it's like, unchanged for like, years. Where is that sitting? Like, who's got. I want to know if you're on this, if you're listening to this podcast, who is holding bitcoin on the omni layer still? There's like, still, like, you can pull this up on coin metrics I recommend.
00:12:09.020 - 00:12:11.348, Speaker B: It's a billion dollars just sitting there somewhere.
00:12:11.396 - 00:12:13.916, Speaker A: It hasn't moved and it doesn't increase or decrease.
00:12:14.020 - 00:12:23.196, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there was actually a burn recently. It's split now. I think it's neck and neck between tether and or Tron and ETH in terms of where the tethers are.
00:12:23.260 - 00:12:29.372, Speaker A: Like, we've talked about this before and I have a theory on it, but why is there tether on Tron? What's the deal with that?
00:12:29.468 - 00:12:46.912, Speaker B: Well, I don't think, you know, your tether users in sort of Nigeria or the Philippines care much about the, you know, qualities of, you know, the node operation, how hard it is to run a node for Tron or ETH or whatever. You know, these people just want to use dollars and they want low fees.
00:12:47.048 - 00:12:48.376, Speaker A: They want a mobile wallet.
00:12:48.480 - 00:13:04.558, Speaker B: Yeah. They want to hold dollars in their smartphone and transact with them and run their export business or whatever it is. And so they don't really care about the blockchain and they don't care about tethers attestations either, for that matter. You know, they don't care about the amount of commercial paper that they hold.
00:13:04.646 - 00:13:27.914, Speaker A: Right. I saw tether is trading at $1 flat, so that's the first time. And now since May, right. It's been trading slightly below the peg since then, which is kind of an interesting development, I guess. I mean, you know, we joke, you know, stable coins are really interesting for a lot of reasons. But you know, if you think about number go up as the sort of one of the many mantras, primarily of the bitcoiners. Right.
00:13:27.914 - 00:13:48.414, Speaker A: Then stable coins or numbers stay flat technology, they should be. Right. So just on bitcoin we can talk a lot about it. Of course, you've written a ton about bitcoin. I really recommend our listeners read some of Nick's writing. I think you got it all posted at Nickcarter dot in fo.
00:13:49.434 - 00:13:50.130, Speaker B: That's right.
00:13:50.202 - 00:14:08.636, Speaker A: Solid website by the way. I gotta make mine better. Thank you. So I don't want to go too deep. Nick's commented a ton in the public domain on bitcoin mining and stuff. We're going to ask some of these questions, but if it's not hyper bitcoinization, bitcoin obsoletes all money. It could be.
00:14:08.636 - 00:14:33.652, Speaker A: That's one thesis for how bitcoin goes in the end state. Another is digital gold, that it's a hard money, investable asset. Some people think bitcoin will be for payments. I think all of these are very nascent. If you had to pick, in your view today, the likeliest endgame for bitcoin whenever it reaches its apex of adoption and popularity, what do you think that looks like?
00:14:33.708 - 00:15:12.544, Speaker B: Yeah, you can track gold's prevalence relative to global GDP and waxes and wanes over time. I think if you wanted to look for a ceiling on bitcoin's value, you would basically projected out that way. You would look at historical peaks in terms of gold's economic weight relative to economic output, and you would assume that bitcoin would be the hard money that served that purpose. I think it would look very different from the setup we have today. But, yeah, I think that's your optimistic case.
00:15:12.664 - 00:15:41.270, Speaker A: You think central banks one day, or. Or I guess I shouldn't say central banks even maybe two central banks, maybe nations in general, have to move back at some point to a pegged, a dollar pegged to a hard asset, a currency pegged to a hard asset. Of course, it's fluctuated many times, right. The history of money is replete with instances of debasement and rebasement, do you think? Or is it the end of history where we never have to go back to hard national currencies based on hard money?
00:15:41.342 - 00:15:49.234, Speaker B: Right. I mean, so what did we do for most of the history? Basically gold standards. And then we would fight wars, we would leave the gold standard, then we would get back on the gold standard.
00:15:49.314 - 00:15:53.018, Speaker A: Over and over again. Rome did it itself, like four separate ties or something.
00:15:53.106 - 00:16:08.690, Speaker B: So then you'd have your inflation, then you'd have offsetting deflation oftentimes. And then. So we did that. And then we broke the cycle in 1970 or 1913 even. Right. Basically, after World War One, we tried to get back on the gold standard.
00:16:08.722 - 00:16:09.106, Speaker A: We failed.
00:16:09.130 - 00:16:29.068, Speaker B: We had the Great Depression as a consequence. And then from there we were basically off it. From 1971 onwards, we've really been off it. That's been a real aberration. Now what's happening? We're having a bit of a rebasement, but to commodities. Look at what different currencies are doing in the world right now. Euro is getting crushed.
00:16:29.068 - 00:16:50.586, Speaker B: JPY is getting crushed. Ruble's doing exceedingly well. The dollar is doing very well as well. What do those two nations have in common? The US, USA and Russia. They're commodity rich, energy rich nations. Russia's explicitly weaponizing their energy, literally. Europe is short energy, Japan is short energy.
00:16:50.586 - 00:17:25.794, Speaker B: So the currency performance is a function of the world realizing, oh, your access to actual real physical commodities and resources really matters. And we're going to express that in the currency markets. That's what Zoltan Pozar keeps talking about with Bretton woods. Three is repricing all of these currencies with respect to the actual physical resources these countries have. That's our intermediate stage. Then the question is, do we go to a neutral settlement medium or a neutral reserve asset? That'd be the next stage. Maybe that's when bitcoin starts to be important.
00:17:25.794 - 00:17:26.602, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:17:26.738 - 00:17:47.370, Speaker A: And gold couldn't really be that. It had been that where all the gold several blocks south of us in the New York fed. And you just, like, when you want to settle in gold, like, some. Some man opens up a cage and like. Like, a person opens up a cage and carts a brick of gold from, like, you know, Nigeria's vault to, like, the US's vault.
00:17:47.402 - 00:17:49.290, Speaker B: Does it even move? I don't even know if it even.
00:17:49.322 - 00:17:51.454, Speaker A: I think it does. I'm not sure.
00:17:52.114 - 00:17:53.610, Speaker D: I don't think it physically it doesn't.
00:17:53.642 - 00:17:56.906, Speaker B: Okay. And just, you know, bitcoin can settle.
00:17:56.970 - 00:18:12.528, Speaker A: Can. So. So you think, is it possible that in that, like, neutral, global. I mean, I think we probably agree that bitcoin, one of its main value propositions, it's certainly at the core of my thesis, is that it is the most neutral, decentralized, hardened protocol.
00:18:12.616 - 00:18:12.864, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:12.904 - 00:18:20.344, Speaker A: And there's something like a global, decentralized, neutral trade settlement medium. Bitcoin sounds like a decent option for that.
00:18:20.464 - 00:18:23.896, Speaker B: It's something you want to include in your Bancor 2.0.
00:18:23.960 - 00:18:24.136, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:24.160 - 00:18:28.694, Speaker B: And that's not Bancor, the DeFi protocol. That's, you know, through Keynes Bancorp.
00:18:29.114 - 00:19:07.574, Speaker D: Unfortunately, one of the things that I don't think people realize is the folks in power, the guys at New York Fed, determining monetary policy, et cetera, they're a bunch of old PhD folks, and they're not as up the curve on bitcoin and crypto as one might like. I think it's going to take literally another generation before you see a bank of Japan or a Bank of England or RB and Zed or someone like that actually having bitcoin in their balance sheet.
00:19:08.154 - 00:19:29.422, Speaker B: It's just going to take time. I think it's more likely. This is Luke Groman's view. He advocates for a portfolio of gold and bitcoin, because his view is that gold is more likely to be remonetized than it is to monetize bitcoin from scratch, precisely because of this reason, because the governments own gold already. So why not start with what you have and try and reestablish that.
00:19:29.518 - 00:19:30.394, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:19:31.014 - 00:19:52.210, Speaker D: Just as a side note, one of the charts I look at a lot is the bitcoin gold ratio. It was basically bounced perfectly off support recently, eleven or ten. And so I think that's a relationship that you're supposed to watch closely, and I definitely recommend that people look at it graphically.
00:19:52.402 - 00:19:59.370, Speaker A: All right, well, we have a range of topics that we'd love to talk. Christine, what we got on this list, what should we talk about next? About?
00:19:59.442 - 00:20:25.104, Speaker C: Yeah, one of them is about stable coins. And where we see the role of stable coins in this future. Do we see like one stable coin, like USDC kind of winning out, or do we see a bunch of different governments, states issuing their own cbdcs in that future where bitcoin might take a bigger role in the monetary regime? Where do we see stable coins fitting into the picture? Nick?
00:20:25.224 - 00:21:25.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, to me, stable coins are actually the more important thing to watch in terms of the sort of next five years here of sovereign currency development. I've been public about the fact that I expect to see crypto dollarization, and actually for that to be really disruptive and for that to be more of a trend in the near term than bitcoinization or hyper bitcoinization. We've seen dollarization, we've seen it happen spontaneously with cases like Ecuador in the early two thousands. We've seen it happen officially, which is actually the more common way the central bank will institute dollarization to prevent an inflationary collapse. Now we're going to start to see crypto dollarization, where it's basically happening via stable coins. I hope that there will be many competing stable coins. I think they'll mostly refer to the dollar because why would you have it refer to anything else? And really the dollar has the liquidity and the treasury market to support it.
00:21:25.604 - 00:21:32.672, Speaker B: And if you look at the data, I looked this up recently, I think it's 99% of all stable coins reference a dollar.
00:21:32.728 - 00:21:33.832, Speaker A: Yeah, like stable coins apply.
00:21:33.888 - 00:21:34.104, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:34.144 - 00:21:36.768, Speaker A: It's like tether has a euro tether.
00:21:36.816 - 00:21:42.632, Speaker B: But like, no one uses it. Yeah. And the next most popular one is actually gold. And then I think maybe Paxos has.
00:21:42.648 - 00:21:43.674, Speaker A: A gold stable coin.
00:21:43.784 - 00:21:44.574, Speaker B: Tyler has.
00:21:44.694 - 00:22:13.412, Speaker A: That actually makes sense. It's nice because it's a commodity, so it doesn't. So it's not a security. But if you are a person, an institution, whomever you are, and you like blockchains, your assets on blockchains, for whatever reason, whether you're a person, you have a mobile wallet, or if you're I don't know, business that has crypto custody. Maybe you want more stuff. I mean, maybe that's how tokenized commodities, maybe that's how eventually we get to tokenize equities one day where just because you like the infrastructure better. I don't know.
00:22:13.508 - 00:23:01.178, Speaker B: I know. I think actually the gold stable coin models I've seen have been pretty thoughtful in terms of giving you a specific claim on gold and making that a really tight linkage. Yeah, I see crypto dollarization as the next trend here. I think we are going to have a wave of sovereign defaults. When DXY gets strong, there's a lot of defaults out there in the world, right? That's, you know, so like that's sort of what happens if you look at the preview, you look at the asian financial crisis, you look at the eastern european financial, you look at, you know, just these various crises. If you go back a few decades, the commonality is the dollar is strong. And then always it's like you get things like the Plaza accord where you're begging to like devalue the dollar to save everyone, right? And so the dollar is like really the apex predator here.
00:23:01.178 - 00:23:36.462, Speaker B: It doesn't seem great as dollar holders, right, 9% devaluation last year. But relative to everything else, it's crushing it. So that's what I expect to see here. And for the first time we have this financial infrastructure which can distribute dollars to pretty much everyone globally in such a way that they can hold it outside of the bank system. And that's been the problem with dollarizations in the past, is that you've always had to do it through the banks. That's always given the local government discretion over how the process happened. That's given them the power to sort of inhibit it.
00:23:36.462 - 00:24:06.978, Speaker B: Now it's much more uncontrolled, it's much more spontaneous, much more bottom up. And so that's what I'd expect to see. And I think you'll see more like Lebanon, more like Turkey, where in conjunction with inflationary event, a local devaluation. You're going to see all these other headlines about like crypto exchanges, booming government bans crypto exchanges, p two p adoption of stable coins happening. And that's very, very hard to inhibit from the state level. So I think that's what we're going to see. That's going to be the tremendously disruptive trend in the next couple of years.
00:24:07.066 - 00:24:17.354, Speaker C: Is there like a stablecoin infrastructure you see kind of winning out like, be it algorithmic or over collateralized or something like the Circle Paxos question, like, what is that model?
00:24:17.394 - 00:24:18.666, Speaker A: What do you think is the dominant model?
00:24:18.730 - 00:24:42.554, Speaker B: Fiat backed, I think is simplest and most credible. Yeah, just the fiat backed, because USDC, they don't really care if their coins are used in Venezuela. I mean, I actually asked Jeremy Allaire this and he was fine with it. Right. Like, and you know, those, like a regular, you know, person using a stable coin on a retail basis, they're not redeeming with circle or center directly, but it still works.
00:24:42.714 - 00:24:58.222, Speaker A: So on this topic, real quick, is we expect today or tomorrow? Today, Wednesday, what? July 20, is that the date? July 20 or tomorrow in the House, we expect a major stablecoin bill to be unveiled.
00:24:58.358 - 00:24:59.034, Speaker B: Really?
00:24:59.334 - 00:25:28.374, Speaker A: Which will codify fiat backed stablecoins, I think, as the sort of legal path forward in the US now, I don't know if that'll be what the status of the bill exactly be, but I'm told it is likely to be bipartisan in the House from some leadership folks. So this could be, to your point, I think that's. This is apropos. It is current, it is happening. And your point is super interesting that this extends the reach of the dollar. This is good for America, I think, if done correctly.
00:25:28.914 - 00:26:15.022, Speaker D: But I do think that there is a place for non USD stables, particularly once the dollar starts to weaken in any way. Where I see stable coins at is very similar to nix, but I see much greater transparency, much more improved liquidity in terms of redemption facilities, but also, and most importantly, a greater rate of interest rate pass through. Right. I think that all these stablecoin companies now, they're collecting sort of fat spreads where they get to take your dollars at zero or call it 50 basis points for term or something like that, and they get to put it in three month t bowls at 3% and collect the 270 NIM.
00:26:15.158 - 00:26:15.658, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:15.766 - 00:27:07.592, Speaker D: I think the future is stable coins that pay you interest. Just to give you guys context, basically every developed central bank on the planet outside of Japan is raising interest rates to positive right now. I think once you get people getting interest on their dollars just by holding the dollars, not even in a savings account, but my stable is actually earning me yielding it. You're lending it to the US government, treasury securities. But once you get the interest rates to be positive, that's a powerful motivator. And if you're paying european folks in euro interest rates, et cetera, so you'll drive adoption that way. And then eventually, I think a lot of money, foreign exchange is going on chain curve is going to be the future of currency exchanges.
00:27:07.592 - 00:27:28.596, Speaker D: You're going to be trading the Aussie euro pair on curve for cheaper than where you do your airport currency conversion. And if you get it to the point of institutional liquidity, where you have hundreds of billions being Lp'd, that will be the future of currency exchange.
00:27:28.660 - 00:27:56.998, Speaker C: How do we see the comeback of crypto yields? Because we've been talking on this podcast, especially how the yields that you can find in the traditional financial market is so much better right now than what we have in crypto. If we see. If that. If that is something that we see in the future, how do we think that, like, the downfall of what we're seeing right now in the crypto markets of all these crazy yields, like, how does it come back? And how does it come back stronger and more resilient than before?
00:27:57.126 - 00:28:33.234, Speaker D: You know, it just has to be. The yield has to be sustainable. You know, it can't be a luna where it's just you're printing it. The yield has to come from sustainable sources, and sources that people can rely on, and people know that they're regulated entities. This bill being passed probably forces a lot of stablecoin issuers transparency to hold more assets than necessary. Even that will eat into their margins and stuff, but it'll give people more assuredness that their assets are safe. Transparency, like efficiency of movement.
00:28:33.234 - 00:28:40.826, Speaker D: And also, you do need, like, the level of interest rates to be non zero or non negative as well. No, that's a huge.
00:28:40.890 - 00:28:54.298, Speaker A: Hopefully, we don't go all the way back to zero and negative rates. I mean, that just is a crazy. Although if you look at the history of the rates recently, meaning, like, the last 30 years, it's like, lower highs over and over again. Every time they raise again, they go.
00:28:54.346 - 00:28:57.428, Speaker D: 40 year bull market, fixed income. Well, it's arguably over.
00:28:57.476 - 00:29:04.024, Speaker A: But speaking about credit, Nick, you have an article that just came out about credit in crypto, right?
00:29:04.404 - 00:29:11.220, Speaker B: Well, I don't know where it is. It's lost in the coindesk. Kind of like CRM somewhere. Yeah, yeah, maybe it's out.
00:29:11.292 - 00:29:28.024, Speaker A: It's coming soon. At least I think by the time this podcast is live, it will have been out. So this airs on Friday. So what did you. What was your view on it? I mean, were you saying that it's cyclical, like, or everyone's saying, like, the age of, like, depositor crypto is over. Do you think that's true?
00:29:28.104 - 00:29:54.128, Speaker B: Yeah. So funny. I mean, it was funny when I was writing that article, I went on Twitter. I know I haven't been posting a lot of tweets lately, but I saw a spaces, which was called Celsius is dead, long live bitcoin. And I was like, what? These things aren't in opposition. Like, bitcoin is just a substrate, and it's something that will be used in these credit relationships as it has been.
00:29:54.256 - 00:29:57.056, Speaker A: And that's what Alfie talked about with bitcoin banks.
00:29:57.160 - 00:30:06.480, Speaker B: It's like, guys, this. And I've written about this, too, a number of times. Like, I view the creation of credit on top of bitcoin. Bitcoin being this, like, high powered form.
00:30:06.512 - 00:30:08.720, Speaker A: Of collateral, which is to say, pristine collateral.
00:30:08.752 - 00:30:28.414, Speaker B: Pristine collateral. It's a very suitable kind. In fact, it's much better than anything that came before for collateral purposes. That is actually the key, really, for bitcoin. That's always been my view. I viewed it as this asset that banking sector would be built up around. Now, it just so happens that the v one instantiation of crypto credit was pretty bad.
00:30:28.414 - 00:30:45.740, Speaker B: It wasn't great. A lot of it was based on these fake yields that weren't yields that were actually just subsidized. Subsidized. Or it's a function of token issuance. It wasn't really sustainable. There was just literal fraud in some of the yields.
00:30:45.772 - 00:30:45.940, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:45.972 - 00:31:32.354, Speaker B: We're going to learn more about that in the coming months. But yeah, there's a bunch of fraud, and there was just misallocation and just poor underwriting decisions and so on, whatever. That doesn't mean the credit is going to vanish. A lot of bitcoin is, and I don't want to pick on them specifically, but they tend to have really explicit views on this. A lot of bitcoiners have this rothbardian view that, like, nothing but full reserve banking is legitimate, and that fractional reserve banking is somehow fraudulent, which is just totally incompatible with financial history. If you look at the most unencumbered, laissez faire free banking environments throughout history, where there's no regulation whatsoever, so the market just equilibriates somewhere. You don't end up with full reserve banking.
00:31:32.354 - 00:31:53.210, Speaker B: That's not a product that people want. Basically. Yeah. Like, okay, some people want custody, but really what people want is genuine banking with maturity transformation, with underwriting, with credit creation. Right. And that is quote unquote fractional reserve. So, yeah, we're going to get the reemergence of credit, but it's going to have better characteristics this time.
00:31:53.210 - 00:32:10.678, Speaker B: That's my prediction. Right. So lenders are going to embrace proof of reserve, they're going to embrace explicit liquidity or capital ratios. And it just so happens we're using cryptographic assets. So you can literally prove your liquidity ratio. Regulators should love that. Right? They don't understand it yet, but they'll love it when they find out about it.
00:32:10.726 - 00:32:35.878, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about proof of reserve, because you really were quite instrumental in pushing forward. I don't know if you created the concept, but you were early on advocating for it. And I know you've done a lot of work on proof of reserve. Think on. If you go to that website I mentioned before, Nick Carter dot in Fo, you've got stuff on proof of reserve there for people to know what we're talking about, first of all, what is that? And we are making progress, aren't we? I know there's some cracking, I think, does proof of reserves.
00:32:35.966 - 00:32:41.006, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a wall of fame on my website for those who are doing it. Institutions. So go check that out.
00:32:41.030 - 00:32:42.542, Speaker A: You'll see we don't have to list them all.
00:32:42.558 - 00:33:14.328, Speaker B: But it's growing. Yeah, it's growing. Yeah. So basically, the initial idea was, as a kind of depository institution, an exchange, or custodian really was for custodians. You could prove that, basically, you could add up all your liabilities and all your assets and you could prove that they match perfectly. And with, for instance, bitcoin, it's very easy to prove ownership of bitcoin. And then as an exchange, you could do like a merkelized thing and basically add up all your user accounts and prove that they're equivalent to the amount of bitcoin held.
00:33:14.328 - 00:33:15.776, Speaker B: That's sort of the simplest form.
00:33:15.840 - 00:33:16.888, Speaker A: That's the asset side.
00:33:16.976 - 00:33:46.396, Speaker B: Yeah. And so pretty straightforward, actually. Kraken did one in 20, 1415, waited seven years to bring it back. They did. Finally, for them, Bitmex did one recently. I think last year there was a wave after Mount Gox, and then more recently there's been a newer wave, and now we're seeing more exotic ones where stable coins are doing something similar, which is not exactly a proof of reserve, in my opinion. They're using this one for the most part.
00:33:46.396 - 00:34:23.496, Speaker B: They use this one auditor called Armanito, shout out to them, they will pull through real time data from the bank and then compare that to the liabilities which are on the blockchain, and compare those. So that's not really cryptographic proof of reserve, but it's still like innovation in accounting, which is good, in my opinion. And then we even have some of the lenders are now doing proofs of reserve. Ledden is doing it. Nexo claims to be doing it. We'll see how the quality of those assurances. But the point is, like, these institutions are now competing on different ways to prove how solvent they are and transparent, which is great.
00:34:23.560 - 00:34:26.032, Speaker A: That only helps consumers and end users.
00:34:26.128 - 00:34:43.284, Speaker B: And you're going to see so much more demand for this. And so that's sort of one of the features of, like, credit 2.0. The other one I would look at would be transparency in terms of actual counterparties. Right. Because if you look at the CeFi lenders, they were very untransparent. Right. Nobody knew who was lending to whom.
00:34:43.284 - 00:34:52.725, Speaker B: Turns out they're all lending three arrows, and none of them told each other about that. Maybe if they'd communicated, if people had been like, hey, wait, you guys lending? How much of these guys.
00:34:52.789 - 00:34:53.101, Speaker A: Whoa.
00:34:53.157 - 00:35:15.086, Speaker B: Holy crap. Then we would have maybe abated the crisis. What I would look to would be hybrid c five DeFi models of lending. We're actually seeing some of those. There's a few of these where you're using DeFi protocols, but then there's actual underwriting and there's intermediaries that are performing.
00:35:15.190 - 00:35:17.118, Speaker A: The credit systems and assessments.
00:35:17.206 - 00:35:31.318, Speaker B: Right, so it's not fully maples of the world. Exactly. Yeah. So it's not fully defi. It's not fully defied the way the Aaver compound is. Right. But what's interesting here is that the loans and the interest payments, et cetera, et cetera, happening on chain, so you can tell who's on the end of these.
00:35:31.366 - 00:35:32.254, Speaker A: Very transparent.
00:35:32.334 - 00:35:43.476, Speaker B: So you can use Nansen to figure out who it is. Or in practice, these protocols just disclose who the counterparties are. That's a model of transparency. That's far better than the c five.
00:35:43.540 - 00:35:48.092, Speaker A: Right. Using the blockchain as the plumbing to actually operate the loan.
00:35:48.268 - 00:36:04.900, Speaker B: And so in this case, it's a feature that the blockchain is transparent. Right. It's an enormous feature. And so that, I think, is a much better system. And you look, these can still fail. Like these maples and these true FIS and the clear pools. Like, yeah, there were defaults in those portfolios, but it's fully transparent.
00:36:04.900 - 00:36:25.768, Speaker B: And so I like that hybrid model a lot better. I think those are going to be the winners as we move away from the fully black box c five lenders, or rather the CFI lenders, as they evolve from this crisis, because theyre going to continue to exist, for sure. Theyre going to be pushed to be far more transparent. So im actually pretty optimistic about the credit sector overall.
00:36:25.896 - 00:37:06.396, Speaker C: Speaking of those kinds of blockchain innovations that you see, Nick, I know that youve done a lot of research and looking into decentralized identity on the blockchain. Curious to know if any of those technologies that you were talking about really help support, like the transparency around wallet identification and building a decentralized identity system on top of the blockchain. Does it go against everything that we believe in in terms of privacy and pseudonymity? What other technologies are being built specifically for decentralized identity? I feel like that's another emerging area of innovation that we might see more of and curious to know.
00:37:06.540 - 00:37:32.816, Speaker B: Yeah, well, that's kind of the holy grail of web3, I would say, right. Is being able to use your on chain credentials to log into things. And right now it's a pretty good experience logging into stuff with your metamask or whatever. That clearly can't be the final destination because you don't really want to tie yourself and your credentials to your wallet as well.
00:37:32.880 - 00:37:33.888, Speaker A: Literally to your bank account.
00:37:33.936 - 00:37:53.632, Speaker B: Yeah, you don't want to have that all in one place. It's like, all right, if I'm going to have my ens and I'm going to log into a web3 social network, I also have to disclose my portfolio. That's crazy. That'd be like, all right, log into Google and anyone that you send an email to, you're also telling them how.
00:37:53.648 - 00:38:03.048, Speaker A: Much my fidelity account, like log in with fidelity. Want to buy this thing on like a direct to consumer brand website. But like, here's all the mutual funds I own.
00:38:03.096 - 00:38:03.328, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:03.376 - 00:38:03.872, Speaker A: That can't.
00:38:03.928 - 00:38:17.696, Speaker B: Right. So we clearly need to progress from that. So there's like a lot of smart people working on it. And I will confess I'm not fully up to date on like, the state of affairs of dids and what is.
00:38:17.720 - 00:38:23.564, Speaker A: It, soul bound tokens, verifiable credentials. You know the guys at square.
00:38:24.284 - 00:38:24.932, Speaker B: That's right.
00:38:24.988 - 00:38:32.036, Speaker A: With the TBD and TBD, which is. That's an actual thing. Yeah, they like to joke.
00:38:32.100 - 00:38:36.300, Speaker B: I don't know what the name, I don't understand the name of the TBD. And then it's a lot of numbers.
00:38:36.332 - 00:38:41.468, Speaker A: I don't either, but they like to make jokes with their names, like web five and stuff. And I respect that.
00:38:41.556 - 00:39:11.634, Speaker B: But I do fundamentally like the idea because look at the way we use credentials today. So there's like the web two way where it's just like basically apple and Google and whoever just control everything and you're totally accountable to them and you're totally disempowered. Right. They have all the power. You have no power. And then that's obviously not going to be sustainable because basically, I think it becomes a geopolitical issue. We can't just literally delegate control of the Internet to four companies or whatever.
00:39:11.634 - 00:40:02.936, Speaker B: The other thing is, passwords are basically increasingly cumbersome. That's sort of impossible. So we either outsource it to one of these companies or if you're more technical, then you have your password manager that just collapses back to storing your credentials with cryptography that you yourself custody. That sounds a lot like maintaining your wallet and then logging in with your wallet. I think that this is a natural progression where we're going to move back towards self custody of our own credentials and then we're going to be able to log into things and retain much more discretion and power. Yeah, I don't think the current model that we have where you're just literally logging in with your private key or whatever, that can't work. So we're going to have to find some way to segregate your financial self from your sort of authenticated self.
00:40:03.040 - 00:40:28.694, Speaker C: I feel like there's so many outstanding questions with the decentralized identity projects and a lot of those you've already raised, but there's still also a lot of outstanding questions about what even is web3 and how much of web3 is like a social arena, how much of it is a gaming arena, how much of it is a VR arena. Do you have any thoughts around what the future of web3 will look like?
00:40:28.774 - 00:41:00.638, Speaker B: So web3, I think, is a made up. I mean, all terms are made up, right? But web3 is especially made up. So basically, I think it was like a bait and switch to rebrand crypto for the mainstream. Right? People don't like crypto. And so then we went to web3. What is web3? Does web3 stand for just decentralized identity kind of stuff? Is it only the non monetary uses of crypto? Is it the monetary? Does it encompass those as well? Is it just a term we use to make the New Yorker less worried about crypto? Is that what it's for?
00:41:00.726 - 00:41:02.510, Speaker C: Probably. That sounds the most accurate.
00:41:02.542 - 00:41:03.878, Speaker B: They seem to really like it.
00:41:04.006 - 00:41:05.902, Speaker D: It's a great way to raise a vc fund.
00:41:05.998 - 00:41:38.154, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. As a web3 vc, I'm not sure what web3 is. I don't think anyone's ever done a great job of defining it, to be clear. And I also think it contains some really weird components. Here's the main issue I have with web3 discourse. Oftentimes you'll see specifically VC's that invest in web3. They'll say stuff like, yeah, with web3 we can retake power over Internet platforms and then we can give users ownership, literal ownership in the platforms.
00:41:38.154 - 00:42:55.638, Speaker B: That actually has weirdly marxist undertones, in my opinion. Basically, you have really big venture firms that were the winners in web two and they successfully invested in web two, and then they have a lot of power. They're basically saying, we're going to liberate you from these web two platforms through tokens. Typically, we're going to give you control, and if you contribute data to these new Internet platforms, you're going to get ownership and you're going to have equity in these things. But here's the thing. If they're investing in these platforms, how true is the story of liberation that they're telling people about? I mean, if they successfully invested in web two and they became the barons of the web two fiefdoms, and now they're telling you, oh yeah, we're going to liberate you from those guys who happen to be us, and we're going to free you in this world where we're going to, through tokens, somehow give you ownership over the new Internet platforms. A, how is that a true story if that's something that VC's that are literally investing in this stuff are telling you? And b, how do you determine allocative outcomes? How do you plan for an outcome where each person owns a specific fair share of some capital? Basically, you can't plan for that.
00:42:55.638 - 00:43:29.330, Speaker B: The market determines that. That's why I find that there's a really weird marxist overtone with some of the web3 stuff. So in my mind, I would advocate for a more pared down vision of web3, which doesn't suggest or deter to people that they are going to have literal ownership of whatever Internet platform comes next. I would just say that they would be more empowered relative to those platforms. But I wouldn't proclaim that you're going to own x percentage of the next facebook because you can't determine that. That's only something that the market can do.
00:43:29.442 - 00:43:36.410, Speaker C: Wow, Nick, not only are you a bitcoin moderate, but you're also a web3 moderate. You might also be kicked out of this group.
00:43:36.522 - 00:43:40.682, Speaker B: I know. Are there web3 maximalists? Because if so, I'm not sure, because.
00:43:40.778 - 00:44:09.704, Speaker A: Usually you have to have an actual ideology. And as you pointed out, I think people don't really know what web3 really is? I do. Personally. When I think of the concept, it's much more close to what you've described for like, universal login and did. We called it the accountless Internet, right. Like, it's, it truly is. If I open up my, I'm not even going to name it for security reasons, whichever password manager I may or may not use the seriously insane number of credentials that I have stored there, that something's got to give on that.
00:44:09.704 - 00:45:00.356, Speaker A: What about, like, you know, you once, I think, said you were talking about, so you wrote a great piece once about social media and I think, I can't remember, I'm gonna paraphrase you, but you said something like, we're all surfs on Jack Dorsey's like feudal land, right? Because you can be rugged, censored, your account broken. This happens to youtubers all the time that make their whole livelihoods out of their YouTube content. And then for one reason or another, they get banned from the platform, um, and lose everything. And, you know, do you think we're going to get like some kind of social, decentralized social media or really, I should say, I guess personally, I don't care too much if it's actually decentralized. It's what you said about these Web 3.0 concept that it's, that it's actually just more resilient, robust, like, you know, just better for users. But do you think that's coming?
00:45:00.500 - 00:45:32.540, Speaker B: That's my bull case for, quote unquote web3. It's not that we would take every person on earth and give them proportional ownership of, like, the next Internet platform via tokens that I don't think is actually possible. But I do think you can define a new model for, like, communication and commerce on the Internet, quote unquote social media where there's more stable property rights associated with your, like, little plot of land, right? So your Twitter username or your Facebook. I haven't used Facebook in ten years. I don't know what it looks like.
00:45:32.572 - 00:45:36.244, Speaker A: My account's basically locked. I don't think you can even post on my wall or whatever.
00:45:36.664 - 00:45:37.464, Speaker B: Your wall.
00:45:37.544 - 00:45:38.152, Speaker A: Remember that?
00:45:38.248 - 00:45:39.844, Speaker D: You didn't get my birthday post.
00:45:40.504 - 00:45:48.416, Speaker A: I actually, back in the day, I was an early Facebook user. We had it in 2004, so I've been off it.
00:45:48.440 - 00:46:28.554, Speaker B: But, you know, just think of your little handle on any, like, you know, web two social media platform as like a little homestead, right? Which you've carved out of the wilderness, basically. And you have put labor and time and effort into improving that plot of land, basically. Now, what I'm advocating is you should be able to own that land. You should be able to graduate from a serf to a farmer that, you know, so you should be able to practice digital enclosure. Right. So, you know, in the medieval ages, they had this common land, and then they closed it off, and that was enclosure, and that created property rights. And so people now cared about the land they worked on.
00:46:28.554 - 00:46:38.314, Speaker B: Right. It was very controversial. People didn't like it. Right. It's like, what do you mean? You own this? No, the people own it. So it's the same reason that web3 is controversial.
00:46:38.354 - 00:46:38.482, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:38.498 - 00:46:49.330, Speaker B: It's digital enclosure. It's the same thing. But that's what I think we should be progressing towards, because right now the model is you're completely disempowered. Right.
00:46:49.402 - 00:46:50.914, Speaker A: At the whim of the platform.
00:46:51.034 - 00:47:14.606, Speaker B: Yeah. And so, like, how do we actually get there? Well, it's gonna be complicated. Like, maybe the social graph is on chain and the data is not on chain. Right. Because, I mean, are you going to be able to put petabytes or yottabytes or whatever on blockchains? Probably not. Is it going to move to more of a thin interface model where the social media platforms are really just interfaces for the same sort of underlying data? And then you're going to have kind.
00:47:14.630 - 00:47:16.694, Speaker A: Of like different email clients, basically.
00:47:16.774 - 00:47:32.946, Speaker B: Yeah. So you'll have maybe different moderation rules. In theory, everything can be exposed to the user, but then maybe there'll be different models where this one is the more stricter moderation. This one is the looser one, and you can take your pick and you can have free exit and free entry.
00:47:33.010 - 00:47:53.914, Speaker A: And you mentioned Macedon. This is one where that is sort of the case. Right. It's a federated social media platform where we can run our own Mastodon instance, us four, and choose to connect to no one. And so it's just a place where we post to each other. But we can say, we also really love this other mastodon that talks about cats or something all the time. Let's connect to them.
00:47:53.914 - 00:48:01.010, Speaker A: And now our user is exposed to each of. Right. And then you could imagine how big graphs build out of these various nodes. And.
00:48:01.162 - 00:48:02.786, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, look, it's one.
00:48:02.810 - 00:48:05.186, Speaker A: Possibility that exists today, by the way.
00:48:05.250 - 00:48:53.224, Speaker B: Yeah. Mastodon. And there's no, like, blockchain stuff there. But I think the persistent identities and the persistent digital property you get from blockchains, those are pretty key. And so I envision you, like, having a genuine hard form of ownership over your plot of land, maybe that credential is on chain, and then you can flip between these networks, and maybe if they're sort of serving you adequately in terms of the terms of service or the legal system, then that is one that you choose to reside on but you're not forced to. So you have your free exit. And so that model seems a lot, lot better than what we have right now with social media, where you just completely unilaterally owned by whoever the dictator of that platform is.
00:48:54.484 - 00:49:17.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that, I like the sound of that future. I think, in the world. I mean, I want to mention the metaverse, right? Because it's this obviously a big buzzwordy concept now. And I view this as the metaverse. Like this today we have at least a version of the metaverse. Your social graph, your digital existence, your zoom calls, your, you know, paying with NFC chips. There's a lot right now.
00:49:17.534 - 00:49:39.650, Speaker A: I don't think it has to be like the movie ready player one, where you're in a haptic suit and you walk on like a three dimensional treadmill and you wear a VR goggles. I think we already have a metaverse, and that ownership is really lacking. And to me, I think this is the best example of what Web three should be as a concept. I think you've made that point very quickly.
00:49:39.682 - 00:49:58.408, Speaker B: Web three is about property rights. It's not about virtual reality ownership. Yeah. It's about genuine. It's about taking digital concepts and reinstituting analog property rights. And that extends to a lot of different things, and that should be part of a broader revolution such that we can own software again. We can own hardware.
00:49:58.408 - 00:49:58.808, Speaker B: Right.
00:49:58.896 - 00:50:08.670, Speaker A: That's been one of the most disappointing, and I know probably, I'm not an expert in SaaS, like, technology revenue models, but the fact that I can't even, like, buy software anymore. I have to lease at all.
00:50:08.782 - 00:50:16.846, Speaker B: You can't, you can't even own a toaster anymore. You kind of have to rent your toaster to. It's like. And cars, too. Like you, I've got all these Kindle books.
00:50:16.870 - 00:50:18.270, Speaker A: They can just rug me at any time.
00:50:18.382 - 00:50:21.174, Speaker B: You're like your Tesla. Like, no, you got to, like, buy the update.
00:50:21.214 - 00:50:24.958, Speaker A: Oh, I saw that Tesla was a Tesla. They. Or, no, there was another car that.
00:50:24.966 - 00:50:26.366, Speaker B: Was for a patch upgrade.
00:50:26.470 - 00:50:30.846, Speaker A: There's literally, you can unlock additional features for a monthly fee. But it's in the car already.
00:50:30.910 - 00:50:33.126, Speaker B: It's already. Theoretically, yeah, yeah.
00:50:33.190 - 00:50:40.596, Speaker A: There was another car company, I can't forget, but it was a, a similar, like, oh, like, if you wanted like the massage chair, like you pay them monthly, but like it's in the car already.
00:50:40.660 - 00:51:00.886, Speaker B: The ring I'm wearing right now, the aura ring I'm wearing. I subscribe to this hardware. I subscribe to the hardware. So like, this is like a terrible world where we've sassified everything and we don't actually own anything anymore. So I'm just advocating a back to the land, regain our ownership. Yeah, Asuza would say a revanchist movement. Okay.
00:51:00.886 - 00:51:06.854, Speaker B: We're taking ownership back. That includes hardware, software and our digital property rights.
00:51:07.634 - 00:51:09.146, Speaker A: It's a bullish vision. I like it.
00:51:09.210 - 00:52:04.096, Speaker C: And what's the platform that we think that this new digital land will be built on? Yeah, built on because obviously one of the biggest things is if we are envisioning a new Internet, a new way of doing digital identity, we need to have a scalable blockchain. And this seems to to be a continuing be source of contention among all the layer one blockchains out there. I mean, I know I have a bias towards Ethereum, but there is quite a lot of other innovative ways in which transaction fees and blockchain scalability can be solved. And there's many different competing theories. There's now modularism versus monolithic change versus blockchain, and blockchains. There's many. Yes, there's many different thesis theses around how, around how this web3 could be built.
00:52:04.096 - 00:52:08.324, Speaker C: Is there a platform that you have in mind, Nick, that's like, you know.
00:52:08.864 - 00:52:31.970, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I would advocate for like data parsimony, you know, so putting as little on chain as you can get away with. Right. So I don't, you know, see a world where like if we rebuild Twitter or whatever, that we literally put everything on chain. That seems crazy, but yeah, put me in the camp of layered scaling. I think modularity is just another way of saying layered scaling.
00:52:32.002 - 00:52:34.450, Speaker A: I think so too. Actually, we were talking about this.
00:52:34.562 - 00:52:39.874, Speaker B: I know it's like a fun rebrand or whatever, but that sounds a lot like just like layers and roll ups and things.
00:52:39.914 - 00:52:53.598, Speaker A: Yeah, they're just. I guess they're saying it's not just put all. Rebuild an entire layer that has availability and computation and transferability and whatever. Okay, well, what if we have a layer that's only available data availability? What if we have one that's only computation? Right.
00:52:53.766 - 00:53:36.842, Speaker B: I will say from the coin metrics experience, and I really encourage everybody to start a company where you run the nodes of like 100 blockchains. I really do think that's a useful experience for anyone. There's real thermodynamic limits that you start to hit when you have these big full nodes that are processing zillions of transactions a second. And basically we've hit those limits already for a few blockchains, to be clear. And things start to really degrade once you reach those limits of computation per second. And basically you end up in a permissioned model where the foundation is the only one running the node. There's some weird anecdotes, I could tell you.
00:53:36.842 - 00:53:42.552, Speaker B: We tried to sync a ripple full node one time. They're like, actually, you know, it's actually faster for us to just mail you.
00:53:42.568 - 00:53:45.336, Speaker A: A hard drive with the blockchain already on it.
00:53:45.360 - 00:53:45.656, Speaker B: Yep.
00:53:45.720 - 00:53:45.920, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:45.952 - 00:54:14.674, Speaker B: So ripple, you know, runs on the sneaker net, basically. So there's a lot of stuff like that where a lot of. Nobody really sees this stuff, but like, you know, your binance smart chains, even your trons actually, Solana, like stuff like that, you're reaching the limits here and you're only getting linear gains in terms of scalability from pushing it further. So clearly that's not going to be the model. I'm not saying those blockchains are doomed, but I think some of them you actually will have data loss as a consequence.
00:54:14.754 - 00:54:39.914, Speaker A: I mean, this has been, this is an OG bitcoin concept, right? Was I like what you said? Data parsimony? Bitcoiners have always tried to keep block space as minimal as possible. Usage of block space. In fact, there were some times I remember where people were actually advocating like around Satoshi dice, they were like mad, like, get this thing off. They were, they were, get this thing off here. It's not, it's the social layer was saying, this is an inappropriate use now.
00:54:39.994 - 00:54:53.442, Speaker B: And Bitmax research had a great piece recently looking at the history of the opera turn wars in bitcoin. And one of the debates there was counterparty. Some of the first tokens issued on bitcoin, their usage of opera turn was seen as abusive.
00:54:53.578 - 00:54:53.946, Speaker A: Right?
00:54:54.010 - 00:54:59.130, Speaker B: So bitcoin has had this built into its cultural fabric the whole time, right?
00:54:59.162 - 00:55:15.012, Speaker A: Not only is it not optimized intentionally, this is a feature, not a flaw, to do things like easy data composability, availability, a virtual machine. Right? That's always point out that is a choice that the bitcoin community has made. It's not an inherent flaw of bitcoin.
00:55:15.068 - 00:55:17.308, Speaker B: Right? That was the design philosophy.
00:55:17.436 - 00:55:42.254, Speaker A: But I think that, and that persists, which is so interesting because having talked with and worked with people in the blockchain space for years, this is a very, very common view until pretty recently, I think, with, you know, the advent of Solana and, you know, the debates about composability. And I think almost everyone was on the layered scaling approach that they thought that was the most.
00:55:42.714 - 00:55:51.426, Speaker B: There was a period in 2015 to, let's say, 2019 where there's a big faction where, like, ethereum people were united with big block people.
00:55:51.530 - 00:55:51.954, Speaker A: That's true.
00:55:51.994 - 00:55:52.290, Speaker B: Remember?
00:55:52.362 - 00:55:53.106, Speaker A: I do remember.
00:55:53.210 - 00:55:59.710, Speaker B: And then, you know, and I see Ethereum is downstream in bitcoin culture in many ways. Then the Ethereum people were like, no, we're going to go to a roll.
00:55:59.742 - 00:56:02.254, Speaker A: Up model, which is possible. That's a good point.
00:56:02.374 - 00:56:05.990, Speaker B: But there was a period of time where it's like, maybe we can just arbitrarily.
00:56:06.142 - 00:56:09.902, Speaker A: I actually recall Vitalik being praiseworthy of bitcoin.
00:56:09.958 - 00:56:11.230, Speaker B: Yeah, for a time.
00:56:11.302 - 00:56:41.964, Speaker A: Yeah, for a time. I do view it. I think Christine mentioned them well, I do think of it as like a layered scaling approach, which includes, I think we agreed, modularity with sort of bitcoin on the far ossified side of it. And ETH is sort of the more accommodative side when it comes to the l one. And then this full monolithic approach, which I think Solana is sort of the iconic one here now. And then maybe, as Christine mentioned, blockchains of blockchain, something like cosmos, that ecosystem. And I don't see.
00:56:41.964 - 00:56:49.374, Speaker A: Is there anyone here? Is there some, like, core, primitive approach that I'm forgetting other than those sort of three approaches we have now?
00:56:49.464 - 00:57:14.538, Speaker B: I think that summarizes them. The thing that I think hasn't been answered yet is in a roll up world or a world with sharding, is it possible to have true, composable atomic defi transactions across these shards? Yeah. And that was always my objection, was that you're going to run into that inefficiency where you're basically going back down to the settlement layer and then you're going back up.
00:57:14.586 - 00:57:22.826, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, it's like the MBTA, the t in Boston, right? They don't have any cross town loops or trains to go everywhere. You have to go into downtown and then go back out. It's one of my big complaints.
00:57:22.850 - 00:57:24.930, Speaker B: Great analogy. Yeah, that's a great analogy.
00:57:25.082 - 00:57:38.666, Speaker A: You know, you were downtown, I was in Cambridge. Anytime I wanted to go, I couldn't go around. If I wanted to go from Cambridge out to, like, Boston College or somewhere like Chestnut Hill or even up to the beach in Revere, you have to go into the center of Boston first and then come back out.
00:57:38.730 - 00:57:49.042, Speaker B: And sometimes they didn't even interoperate. Like, you had the green line, which was like weird buses going through tunnels. It was like the tunnels were built for trains, but then for some reason they put buses in them.
00:57:49.098 - 00:57:51.766, Speaker A: Yeah, the silver line in Boston is like that too.
00:57:51.870 - 00:57:52.794, Speaker B: So strange.
00:57:53.374 - 00:58:01.182, Speaker A: I just thought of that. I wonder if that I'm going to play this analogy out. There might be, you might see an op ed from me in a few weeks. Interoperability is like the MBTA.
00:58:01.318 - 00:58:12.270, Speaker C: I wonder if that makes the roll up arena like a winner takes all, you know, like one very highly performant ZkeVM winning out among all of them for the efficiency gains and everyone just.
00:58:12.302 - 00:58:13.934, Speaker A: Kind of like converging on that.
00:58:13.974 - 00:58:34.450, Speaker C: Yeah, because there is that autonomous within one implementation, but there might not be that composability between different implementations. Or if we see like the cost of deploying on one chain, one EVM compatible chain, as so low that you could just deploy it on several different EVM compatible chains.
00:58:34.562 - 00:59:12.762, Speaker B: I think you got stickiness within ecosystems, though, because people learn specific programming languages and they don't necessarily want to retrain themselves. You learn best practices within the specific smart contract language, and there's momentum in that. And then you also get financial siloization that develops because you have your ecosystem funds and your venture firms that back things. I think that's the thing that throws the wrench in the works here, is you do have a degree of momentum within ecosystems, which kind of guarantees that, like, in my view, we're always going to have a bunch of these blockchains.
00:59:12.818 - 00:59:34.334, Speaker A: Like, almost never die, right? Even like super old annoying ones like that. Really. Nobody uses, like a couple people still run the node, and then it just exists. Right. That long tail just persists and that extends obviously way up from just the really old random ones with two nodes. But like, yeah, this is the identity coins. The communities around these things are really powerful.
00:59:34.334 - 00:59:41.742, Speaker A: I hope it doesn't result ultimately in us living with, like, if there is a web3 future, you know, ten different standards that we often, we all.
00:59:41.758 - 00:59:43.774, Speaker B: Have to deal with. Yeah, yeah.
00:59:43.894 - 01:00:22.518, Speaker A: You have to think the market markets tend to converge on an idea. The word protocol, by definition, means standards, right? Like, so I hope that that's where we get. I think, I do think there's a world where we have definitely more than one blockchain layer, one blockchain. Um, I don't see a world where bitcoin goes away, um, for what it does, but I also see a lot of these things. We're talking about really not being, um, easy to build on bitcoin, or perhaps not even certainly in the ethos of what the bitcoin culture wants on its blockchain, in terms of what bitcoiners are, um, open to, using block space for accommodative.
01:00:22.606 - 01:00:46.518, Speaker B: This is why I keep talking about decoupling the asset in the network for bitcoin. Right. Because they're different things. There's a bitcoin asset which has certain monetary properties, which I would say very desirable, and so on. And then there's the network, which is kind of, like, increasingly underutilized. Right. Like, if you just look at the fees and, like, the utilization, you know, it's just a fact that most of the developer enthusiasm for building things on blockchain networks isn't just not happening on bitcoin.
01:00:46.518 - 01:01:02.216, Speaker B: Right. And that's fine. The question is, like, where do we go from here now, can you take the bitcoin asset and transact it in other venues? Right. I would say probably yes. And this is what a lot of other blockchains are trying to do. They're actually trying to be really accommodative and embrace bitcoin. Right.
01:01:02.216 - 01:01:06.004, Speaker B: So, you know, terra kind of tried to do that. That was very ill fated.
01:01:06.744 - 01:01:07.484, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:08.464 - 01:01:11.408, Speaker B: This is an explicit strategy of the avalanche crew.
01:01:11.496 - 01:01:11.744, Speaker A: Right.
01:01:11.784 - 01:01:21.992, Speaker B: For what it's worth. And I think a lot of these blockchains will eventually realize that they probably want the capital base that exists on bitcoin being the number one.
01:01:22.048 - 01:01:27.432, Speaker A: You have wrapped bitcoin. There was. I think there's Ren BTC. There was TBT.
01:01:27.488 - 01:01:28.200, Speaker B: There's a bunch.
01:01:28.272 - 01:01:39.008, Speaker A: I think Thor chain also embraces a concept like this. I think the real issue today is we just don't have a good trust minimized way to bring bitcoin onto other stuff. Right.
01:01:39.096 - 01:01:52.432, Speaker B: And that might require a change of the bitcoin protocol level, by the way. Right. So, you know, that would be an interesting challenge I would kind of pose to the bitcoiners is, can you make your asset more amenable to being transacted elsewhere?
01:01:52.528 - 01:01:56.656, Speaker A: That is. I don't know. I think most are going to say that's a bridge too far.
01:01:56.840 - 01:02:02.224, Speaker B: A bridge too far. That's good. They also may not like it because it means there's probably fewer fees of the bitcoin.
01:02:02.304 - 01:02:27.864, Speaker A: Well, that was always an interesting question. Right. For all types of sort of abstractions, whether it's bitcoin or other assets, is like, what happens even in lightning, even if you take lightning, let's say, 100% or a vast majority of use cases of bitcoin are actually bitcoin being escrowed and inert, remaining inert on chain, and then the economic activity or transactional activity happening elsewhere. Who pays for those fees?
01:02:28.484 - 01:03:01.222, Speaker B: I remember asking Elizabeth Stark. She came to fidelity, I think, some years ago, and I answered this question. Does lightning cannibalize bitcoins fees? And she said no, because it opens up new transactional space, new economic activity. So that's accretive to fees generally, which I find, you know, persuasive. But look, the fees question, maybe that'll have to be figured out. But I do think ten years from now, many, many times more activity which is sort of bitcoin denominated, bitcoin flavored, will be happening outside of bitcoin than on the bitcoin network itself.
01:03:01.398 - 01:03:24.342, Speaker A: Very interesting. I don't have a strong view on this yet. I haven't figured this out. But it's a question I love talking to people about. And I think that's a really compelling view. I wonder if, I think a lot of people want they look at what bitcoin has from a security and a decentralization. And to your point about nodes, the ease at running and operating the actual network, which is software.
01:03:24.342 - 01:03:51.412, Speaker A: Bitcoin is software. It is other things too, but it is software as extremely desirable. To your point about the monetary qualities, it can't be arbitrarily debased. It's very transparent, incredibly neutral monetary issuance network. And I just say, well, gosh, there might be other things I want. I would prefer them to be somehow on bitcoin. And we just don't have a way to do that really today for most of those things.
01:03:51.412 - 01:04:29.644, Speaker A: And look, I mean, maybe that's a. I think that's okay for bitcoin. Personally, I think bitcoin can be successful without being the platform that all these things are built on. You look at something like ethereum, it's, the communities are much more of like a spaghetti on the wall approach. Like, let's try to build this thing that's so generally composable that it can perhaps do everything right. And I feel like that you're always going to be kind of let down by that, right? So it's kind of this double edged sword where I'm like, on the one hand, I have things I want to do on an open, decentralized network and the one that I trust the most, I hate to use that word in the context of trust minimized, trustless systems like bitcoin. But is bitcoin.
01:04:29.644 - 01:05:05.774, Speaker A: But maybe there's something else I want and I can't do it on bitcoin. So I'm basically forced into this other paradigm. And I think ethereum is quite good at this. It's not like, I think on the scale from secure and decentralized to somehow totally insecure and centralized, Ethereum is probably the next one right after bitcoin for the most part at least of the big ones. So maybe the trade offs are fine. But I think that's where I wonder, is it always like that? Does it stay like that? Or do people embrace side chains or roll ups or something else? Payment channels, like lightning?
01:05:06.954 - 01:05:07.730, Speaker B: How does that get there?
01:05:07.762 - 01:05:25.898, Speaker A: I don't know. For example, you mentioned Elizabeth Stark. The whole project they're doing with Taro, which is to, I think, attempt to use tap tweak to allow, which is a thing you can do with taproot, the taproot upgrade on bitcoin to allow for asset tokenization on lightning. Is that there? I don't know.
01:05:25.946 - 01:05:58.876, Speaker B: I love to see it come full circle where you had master coin, I guess, which became omni counterparty colored coins. So the primitive versions of asset issuance, they all started on bitcoin, then they went to basically ethereum or other chains. And then now there's a more sophisticated way to do it on lightning, which is more data efficient and probably overall it would be super efficient from a data perspective to have stable coins back on bitcoin. We'll see what happens. There's a lot of other variables there.
01:05:58.900 - 01:06:14.812, Speaker A: That matter and it's hard to develop. I think you made this point before it is even on lightning. It's not a. This is where Solana has seen so much success is. It's just really easy to code, right? It's in rust. It's like a bajillion rust developers variables, people overlook.
01:06:14.948 - 01:06:40.764, Speaker B: So the thing that sort of is the most pure and satisfying from like an engineering perspective isn't always the thing that happens, right? There's a lot of other things that go into it. But yeah, I think the ship has sailed in terms of having the sidechain vision be true and having everything being built on bitcoin. Bitcoin maybe could have tried to go that way, but it didn't, and that's fine.
01:06:41.544 - 01:07:04.804, Speaker A: That was like what Pete Rizzo was talking about in his interesting article about monetary maximalist, platform maximalist and network maximalists. And the monetary maximalists are really in the driver's seat for bitcoin today. The platform maximalists were more what I was describing. Gosh, I would like to have stuff on bitcoin. And the old school response used to be, well, any good idea that an altcoin comes up with will eventually be.
01:07:04.884 - 01:07:07.556, Speaker B: Built on bitcoin, but which is manifestly not true.
01:07:07.620 - 01:07:08.612, Speaker A: Right. It hasn't happened.
01:07:08.668 - 01:07:08.932, Speaker B: No.
01:07:08.988 - 01:07:12.244, Speaker A: And that bitcoin culture today doesn't want it to happen.
01:07:12.284 - 01:07:27.952, Speaker B: No, no, no, you're right. So we've moved on from. From saying innovation elsewhere will be done here. Now, we actually don't want that on bitcoin, which is fine. But I do remember a time when the idea was any altcoin, innovation will eventually collapse back to bitcoin.
01:07:28.008 - 01:07:48.114, Speaker A: Right. This has been an awesome discussion. I think we're running up on time here, so I don't know. One last question for you, Nick. What's exciting you? What's up next in your mind, in your world? Anything that you want to highlight that we didn't talk about, that you're excited about? You're in New York now. You're heading back to Miami. You're a Miami guy now, right?
01:07:48.154 - 01:08:05.322, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So I don't know. I think the most interesting thing that's going to happen in the next couple of years is all kind of macro related, and I do think it is. Crypto dollarization is the number one thing to look out for. So we're going to be investing behind that thesis for sure, as we have been.
01:08:05.378 - 01:08:08.304, Speaker A: You were early on this too. You had a great paper called crypto dollars.
01:08:08.344 - 01:08:22.016, Speaker B: Crypto dollars. Yeah, I tried to rebrand stable coins. Didn't work. That's okay. I'll take my licks there. We're still investing in bitcoin stuff. To any bitcoiners listening that are concerned, fear not, I'm still here.
01:08:22.016 - 01:08:30.400, Speaker B: I'm just not a bitcoin maximalist, nor have I ever been taking the opportunity to clear the air on that one. It's been an interesting process.
01:08:30.472 - 01:08:44.168, Speaker A: Great podcast you did with Joe Wiesenthal and Tracy alloway on their Odd Lots podcast of a week or two ago that I listened to solely about that topic about Nick and bitcoin maximalism. So I recommend folks check that out if they want to go down that rabbit hole further.
01:08:44.256 - 01:08:52.364, Speaker B: We'd been slated to do an odd Lots podcast for literally years, and then they finally got me on when it was like the one thing I didn't want to talk about.
01:08:52.784 - 01:09:05.078, Speaker C: Did you kind of foresee this coming though, like, given that a lot of your following has been built up by bitcoiners where you kind of always like anticipating the other shoe to drop people to finally realize, you know, I co.
01:09:05.086 - 01:09:09.270, Speaker A: Found metrics, bitcoin maximalist venture investor in the blockchain ecosystem.
01:09:09.342 - 01:09:43.963, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'd never considered myself a bitcoin maximalist, never ever. But I guess people just assumed. But yeah, I did. I knew that they would happen and I knew that to be true to yourself, you have to be willing to fire your fans periodically, right. You have to be willing to do it over and over. And I didn't realize people would take it quite so badly. But yeah, I was planning on at some point trying to reconcile the content creator Nick with Nick, who has a real job and has to invest in stuff.
01:09:43.963 - 01:09:51.323, Speaker B: And those were different people. And it's just that the reconciliation was very painful for some of the bitcoin community.
01:09:52.023 - 01:10:11.168, Speaker A: Well, thank you again, Nick, our friend. Really appreciate this. A wide ranging and interesting discussion. I know I'm going to come back to you, so really appreciate it. Great to see you in person here in New York, by the way, which I said to you, I consider the center of the universe for better or worse. And we're down here in Soho. It's really fun doing this podcast in person.
01:10:11.168 - 01:10:22.644, Speaker A: We got to try to do this more often. It's hard with guests. Not everyone's here, but great to see you, man. Thank you. This was Galaxy brains. Thanks for listening. Have a great weekend, everyone.
