00:00:00.320 - 00:00:34.418, Speaker A: Bitcoin is a tool for expanding human freedom. You will hear today about how bitcoin supports human rights and liberty across the world, from activists who fund their operations to refugees who protect their wealth. You might ask whether the freedom to transact has negative repercussions. Some might remember the quote from Ben Franklin quite famously, those who would give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. But the reality is that bitcoin is a terrible ledger for crime. Its transactions are transparent. Its ledger is permanent.
00:00:34.418 - 00:00:55.554, Speaker A: Law enforcement forensic investigators will tell you that bitcoin is easier to trace than traditional fiat, and that its a use. Its use for illicit activity has mostly declined in both real and relative terms over time. But bitcoin has other features that make it widely adopted around the world. In addition to transactional freedom, bitcoin is also provably and predictably scarce.
