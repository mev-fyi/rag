00:00:06.800 - 00:00:11.110, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Digital trading. My friend, how are you?
00:00:11.182 - 00:00:13.142, Speaker B: Good, thanks for having me on, as always.
00:00:13.238 - 00:00:29.680, Speaker A: And I'm excited to talk because it's been a pretty exciting week. I remember last week we talked about hire for longer, a little bit of a repricing of the interest rate curve. But then there was some data that came out last week too that really caused equities to not do great. What happened?
00:00:29.872 - 00:00:32.884, Speaker B: So you had a pretty strong PCE print.
00:00:33.624 - 00:00:35.096, Speaker A: That's not CPI. What is that?
00:00:35.160 - 00:00:46.280, Speaker B: Personal consumption expenditure is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and it printed a 0.5 month on month, which is a really strong reading.
00:00:46.432 - 00:00:48.496, Speaker A: 0.5 month over month inflation.
00:00:48.600 - 00:00:48.904, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:48.944 - 00:00:49.312, Speaker A: Wow.
00:00:49.408 - 00:00:50.256, Speaker B: 0.5%.
00:00:50.360 - 00:00:53.050, Speaker A: That's what I mean. Yeah. Wow, though. That's notable.
00:00:53.192 - 00:00:55.734, Speaker B: Oh no, that's definitely important to annualize.
00:00:55.774 - 00:00:57.190, Speaker A: That, to get to the annualized.
00:00:57.262 - 00:01:05.438, Speaker B: Yes, but you don't annualize. It's the past eleven months of data combined with the current data to get your annualized.
00:01:05.526 - 00:01:06.934, Speaker A: But that was a bad reading.
00:01:07.014 - 00:01:25.496, Speaker B: Yeah, it basically confirmed what you had in the CPI reading, which is also 0.5 month on month. And so generally speaking, prices are rising at 0.5% month on month, around 6% a year, which is not good, especially given that you've had somewhat tight monetary policy for the past like nine months.
00:01:25.560 - 00:01:27.404, Speaker A: You'd think it would be having more of an effect.
00:01:27.864 - 00:02:17.534, Speaker B: You would hope it would be right now, today you got ism prices paid that came in a lot stronger than expected. You had a 51 handle print when I think expectations were for 47. So that's showing resilience in prices. Again, what you've had is a further repricing of rates. Now you're looking at terminal rates that are around 547, 550 area, which is higher than what any Fed person has really been talking about. So this is really one of the first few times where the market's like aggressively getting ahead of the Fed, and that's kind of what's caused equities to come off a bit. And I would also reiterate that cash is again a formidable alternative to owning any risk asset right now.
00:02:17.534 - 00:02:27.454, Speaker B: When you can earn four, five, 6% on low duration stuff at no risk, why take the risk of going into a risk asset?
00:02:28.434 - 00:02:31.394, Speaker A: And the risk is, just to be clear with, you're talking about a Treasury.
00:02:31.514 - 00:02:33.018, Speaker B: Yeah, there's government default.
00:02:33.066 - 00:02:37.210, Speaker A: The risk is that the US government defaults. That's the risk that exists unlikely.
00:02:37.322 - 00:02:40.494, Speaker B: If you talk to an economist, they'd tell you. That's the risk free rate.
00:02:40.954 - 00:02:41.674, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:41.834 - 00:02:49.334, Speaker B: So, yeah, honestly, if the government, us government defaulted, it'd be probably the best thing to happen to bitcoin in a really long time.
00:02:50.484 - 00:02:51.812, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's one of these things.
00:02:51.868 - 00:03:23.274, Speaker B: I'm dead ass. I'm lifting bitcoin hand over fist. If the US government is defaulting, there are some scenarios where it's causing a big risk asset sell off. But I think if people are going to start doubting money and the viability of money, bitcoin seems like a pretty natural gold is probably the better, probably the better risk adjusted trade in that instance. But bitcoin has a role there, I think, with respect to the US government defaulting, we don't have to spend that much time.
00:03:23.314 - 00:03:25.298, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, I just throw that out there as the.
00:03:25.426 - 00:03:33.826, Speaker B: But, yeah, it's really an event that is going to start impacting the market. Now, what will lead to is this thing called extraordinary measures that the treasury adopts.
00:03:33.930 - 00:03:35.746, Speaker A: And have they already been adopting? Right.
00:03:35.770 - 00:03:35.978, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:36.026 - 00:03:38.098, Speaker A: We're already at the debt ceiling.
00:03:38.186 - 00:03:38.666, Speaker B: Correct.
00:03:38.770 - 00:03:45.400, Speaker A: But I think Secretary Yellen had said what, they can do those through like July or something. So technically the politicians can.
00:03:45.512 - 00:03:50.624, Speaker B: Yeah, you can get through July probably like September, et cetera.
00:03:50.664 - 00:03:53.808, Speaker A: But at some point, obviously, the Congress has to figure this thing out.
00:03:53.856 - 00:03:54.064, Speaker B: Correct.
00:03:54.104 - 00:03:55.672, Speaker A: Talking about the debts, they have to raise the debt.
00:03:55.728 - 00:04:33.782, Speaker B: But what happens is normally, like, the treasury likes to keep money on the chance that they have outflows. I think the minimum they keep, or it fluctuates, but it's like they need to keep like five days worth of outflows, potentially, like in their account. Right. And then a buffer, et cetera. And it moved around with COVID and stuff because the government had more things they could possibly spend money on. So what happens is the treasury is like, we don't have a huge debt limit, so we're going to keep a minimum cash amount on hand. And what that does is that takes treasury supply out of the market.
00:04:33.782 - 00:04:55.214, Speaker B: And it's. Anyway, it's a weird technical thing, but long story short, it shouldn't really impact the market that much. It's well telegraphed every year that I've had, I've been in markets. It's like, oh, shit, the debt cell. Oh, shit, the debt ceiling. Notice that one t bill just spiked in yield by a couple of basis points.
00:04:55.914 - 00:04:57.298, Speaker A: But they figure it out.
00:04:57.386 - 00:05:22.976, Speaker B: Yeah, they figure it out. Let's get back to. You're talking about risk assets owning them over high level. We have data that's really strong prices that are still continuing to rise. But the prices that we're most concerned about are like the service sector related stuff, not the goods. And the service things are still going to be tied pretty closely to employment. And employment still at record lows.
00:05:22.976 - 00:05:25.216, Speaker B: So people feel inflation's sticky.
00:05:25.280 - 00:05:37.370, Speaker A: Yeah, because people are willing to pay higher prices still. Right. And that's because people feel. They don't feel poor. They don't. No, that's because they have good jobs and credit cards and their mortgages.
00:05:37.482 - 00:05:39.682, Speaker B: If you have a lot, you're locked.
00:05:39.698 - 00:05:42.698, Speaker A: In at a low rate. And home prices have been appreciating in.
00:05:42.706 - 00:05:44.274, Speaker B: A lot of places or not depreciating.
00:05:44.314 - 00:05:53.370, Speaker A: That much or holding pretty good. Yeah, we were just talking before we started recording about this data that people are looking at, which is the new mortgage applications.
00:05:53.442 - 00:05:56.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're down about like 40% year on year.
00:05:56.474 - 00:05:58.290, Speaker A: And it's at their lowest for decades.
00:05:58.362 - 00:05:59.130, Speaker B: Yes, correct.
00:05:59.202 - 00:06:05.066, Speaker A: So no one's buying a new. Taking out a new mortgage. Not no one, but very few people are taking out a new mortgage because the rates are so high.
00:06:05.210 - 00:06:10.842, Speaker B: Well, correct. But it's also, there's just. Yeah, but the wealth effect.
00:06:10.898 - 00:06:21.098, Speaker A: Right. Because if you, if you have a home already and you can afford the mortgage. Cause it's locked in at a lower rate and the home is appreciating or holding its value and you have a good job. Right.
00:06:21.146 - 00:06:21.690, Speaker B: You're fine.
00:06:21.762 - 00:06:24.810, Speaker A: Like you feel like you can spend money and so you do because you're.
00:06:24.842 - 00:06:26.818, Speaker B: Disposable income now, even if you're losing.
00:06:26.866 - 00:06:32.974, Speaker A: Money in real terms because of inflation, which many people are. Right. Cause real wages aren't actually keeping up with inflation.
00:06:33.964 - 00:06:35.524, Speaker B: They are not. But the other thing.
00:06:35.564 - 00:06:41.468, Speaker A: But like, still though, it's the. You feel like you're doing well. Right. And that's so much of this is like, do you feel like you can spend money?
00:06:41.516 - 00:06:52.468, Speaker B: Here's the other big problem that, you know, I don't think the average american or the average person has really kind of gotten their heads, but like, all the money people keep in their checking accounts and savings is earning nothing.
00:06:52.556 - 00:06:52.924, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:53.004 - 00:06:58.588, Speaker B: Right. So you're getting, you're getting depreciated on your fiat if you're not in these bills that.
00:06:58.636 - 00:07:05.234, Speaker A: So you either spend it now or invest in instruments like in treasuries or.
00:07:05.614 - 00:07:09.502, Speaker B: Theoretically, or keeping it in a bank account is probably the worst thing you can do right now.
00:07:09.558 - 00:07:23.430, Speaker A: I will say I saw there are some of the brokerage firms, obviously. Cause they run like money market funds. There are sort of cash like instruments like that, that feel a little bit like a savings account. But again, you're actually investing in an institutional money market fund or.
00:07:23.462 - 00:07:25.094, Speaker B: Yeah, like Marcus offers bond fund.
00:07:25.174 - 00:07:45.754, Speaker A: Yeah. So like. But yeah, the banks, weren't they asked, they were when they had the bank CEO's, like when it was maybe in December or something before Congress asked some congressman or senator asked them like, why is my bank account paying 0.1% interest? And they're just like, oh yeah, competitive. Yeah, like blah, blah, blah. And then it's like we're taking all that money.
00:07:46.414 - 00:08:23.274, Speaker B: That's really what it is. Yeah, but anyway, so services inflation's hot, home prices, they haven't, and like rents, they haven't been coming off aggressively. And in fact, like the last CPI print, we had a 0.8 print month on month on ownership equivalent rent. And we know that's backward looking. And Nick Timros, who's like the Fed reporter at the Journal, like all the fed people, like, he recently published a piece earlier this week about apartments. And generally speaking, apartment rents have been coming down and you should start to see that in the data a little bit.
00:08:23.274 - 00:08:31.718, Speaker B: And then the other thing to keep in mind is, well, today commodities are a lot higher, but commodities have been getting hosed for the past couple of months.
00:08:31.766 - 00:08:34.790, Speaker A: Energy in particular, not gas. Oh my gosh.
00:08:34.902 - 00:08:39.254, Speaker B: Thank God for the warm weather. Feels like spring in February.
00:08:39.334 - 00:08:45.126, Speaker A: It literally does. Even today in New York where it's like a little chilly, it's still like 40. Yeah, it's not like 20, but yeah.
00:08:45.150 - 00:08:50.278, Speaker B: I mean, the whole commodity complex has come up. So the good side of things has really.
00:08:50.446 - 00:08:54.430, Speaker A: Lumber was like, oh yeah, TX launched lumber futures.
00:08:54.502 - 00:08:59.238, Speaker B: Oh, that's awesome. Back then when that was, what didn't they launch? It's crazy.
00:08:59.326 - 00:09:01.674, Speaker A: We should have known how degenerate they were separately.
00:09:02.114 - 00:09:03.562, Speaker B: But let's go hindsight.
00:09:03.658 - 00:09:09.026, Speaker A: Yeah. But yes, the commodities are off and the mortgages are sticky.
00:09:09.170 - 00:09:24.414, Speaker B: People are off mortgages, but apartment rents are going to come down. The services stuff might stay sticky. I mean, I personally, I think that the US inflation stuff is just a little overblown right now. Like prices will come down, having interest rates this high.
00:09:24.834 - 00:09:25.874, Speaker A: It has to have an effect.
00:09:25.954 - 00:09:43.846, Speaker B: It has to have an effect. And it's also ongoing quantitative tightening, which is draining 95 billion of liquidity every month. It's also, it's not just the US doing it, it's like globally, like everyone's trying to slow shit down. What throws wrinkles into all of this is the chinese reopening.
00:09:43.990 - 00:09:44.518, Speaker A: Yup.
00:09:44.606 - 00:10:13.624, Speaker B: And so basically, like today it was pretty big news. You had chinese data that was really robust. So expansionary PMIs was the headlines overnight. And long story short, you've got a nation of 1.3 billion people that's been saving money for three years, and now they can go out and do stuff and spend money and not wear masks, et cetera. There's some interesting terms that people like revenge spending.
00:10:14.764 - 00:10:30.348, Speaker A: Actually, I like that one. Cause I feel like I did that when our lockdowns really lifted here. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, so just. And then I'm looking at the block clock over my shoulder. We're at 23, seven here today on Wednesday. You know, bitcoin and crypto has been pretty resilient.
00:10:30.348 - 00:10:39.556, Speaker A: And actually, bitcoin's still been leading the way. I think we just updated our year to date numbers. Year to date bitcoin, on a risk adjusted basis. Still the best performer, I would guess.
00:10:39.660 - 00:10:41.820, Speaker B: And better than 40% on the year.
00:10:41.932 - 00:10:44.940, Speaker A: And still better than ethereum, which has also been performing well, risk adjusted.
00:10:44.972 - 00:10:49.172, Speaker B: That sharp is probably like, what? Something stupid.
00:10:49.228 - 00:11:05.016, Speaker A: Yeah, like so, so. But like, even last week, right. You know, I think it was the worst week in equities of this short year so far. But yet bitcoin, what came down from 24 823. Pretty resilient here.
00:11:05.200 - 00:11:34.762, Speaker B: One, I think folks in the US tend to get very us centric about how they think about markets and forget that bitcoin is a global asset. I think part of resilience in crypto has been related to the influence in Asia or the crypto scene in Asia. With Hong Kong officially allowing Hong Kong unrestricted trading.
00:11:34.858 - 00:12:05.054, Speaker A: Yeah, they put out a big regulatory framework that lays the groundwork for how companies can operate. And very granularly, this is the thing we've talked about is what the US has neglected to do. UK has now done, Europe has now done. Now Hong Kong has done, again, comprehensive framework that makes it possible, and I daresay even easy for crypto firms to comply and offer services. Right. Rather than a bunch of gray area stuff or, God forbid, prohibition, outright bullish.
00:12:05.214 - 00:12:26.124, Speaker B: I think that's been super constructive, whether it's in Asia or UK's, as you mentioned. Also, you've had a bunch of asian tokens that have done really well, the asian polygon and the AI stuff. And so. And you know, Korea also has a pretty active, you know, crypto community. I mean, they're the people that pumped aptos.
00:12:26.544 - 00:12:32.256, Speaker A: Yeah, aptos was. That's where they did their big conference. Yeah, they had their conference there in Seoul.
00:12:32.440 - 00:12:33.112, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:12:33.168 - 00:12:34.936, Speaker A: So a range of global factors.
00:12:34.960 - 00:12:46.834, Speaker B: Also global factors. That's. And then I also just think you kind of just have to see who's left. Right. It was an industry that came apart in last year.
00:12:46.874 - 00:12:47.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:48.074 - 00:12:54.482, Speaker B: And so I think you're left with a bunch of strong hands. Right, right. Like all the people that, to be.
00:12:54.498 - 00:13:04.330, Speaker A: Clear, like the coins didn't get destroyed. They got moved from like forced sellers into buyers. And who's buying at those low levels? Well, strong people, long term convicted.
00:13:04.442 - 00:13:08.850, Speaker B: Absolutely. Right. Like if you're scooping up bitcoin at like 16, 17,000.
00:13:08.882 - 00:13:12.930, Speaker A: Yeah. You're not spooked by like 24. Five going down to 23. Hate at all.
00:13:13.002 - 00:13:31.530, Speaker B: Oh, no. Like you're thinking like 510 years down the line. And I mean, I love looking at the weekly and the monthly bitcoin charts. Like, if you're taking a step back and taking a real big picture of you, like the chart says higher, not lower.
00:13:31.602 - 00:13:32.330, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:32.522 - 00:13:37.922, Speaker B: And, you know, 18. What was the bitcoin low?
00:13:38.018 - 00:13:38.370, Speaker A: 16.
00:13:38.442 - 00:13:39.546, Speaker B: Five, even lower. 15.
00:13:39.610 - 00:13:41.698, Speaker A: Eight maybe. It printed at 1.15. Five.
00:13:41.786 - 00:13:42.338, Speaker B: Flash.
00:13:42.466 - 00:13:49.202, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, like during that, but, yeah, called 16. Yeah, we were at 16, six for like weeks. It felt like at one point, but.
00:13:49.218 - 00:13:54.642, Speaker B: Yeah, but it feels like a bottom now.
00:13:54.698 - 00:13:55.418, Speaker A: Yeah, it does.
00:13:55.466 - 00:14:08.898, Speaker B: Structural bottom in bitcoin. And I think there's a lot of investors that did not pay attention when it was at the bottom. And now you have a product that trades like, there's a ton of dip buyers in it.
00:14:08.946 - 00:14:09.574, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:10.114 - 00:14:41.358, Speaker B: To give you an idea, there's been 110 percent dip this year in bitcoin. It was very brief and then you've had a couple of like 5% dips. But this thing for being a 60, 70 volume asset class has given people very little amount of time to actually, like, load up on people at good levels. Right. If it's an asset that, I mean, 20k has got to be huge support. Huge support at this point.
00:14:41.406 - 00:14:57.766, Speaker A: I mean, right now we're ranging between like twenty k and the two hundred week moving average, which has historically been huge support, which we're below, which is in like 25 range slowly coming down over time. So like that, that feels to me like the range at the moment. Yeah, 25K is 25 just also as a mental.
00:14:57.870 - 00:15:30.014, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, I think conceptual number, I think if you take out 25, you're going to 28, but seems like there's some strong resistance at 25. I just think that it's one of those things that you need to own. Right. Tails in. You don't necessarily have to own bitcoin but I think you're supposed to own the right tail of bitcoin, which is swinging options, stuff like that. Because I do think that the FOMO is going to be pretty real when this thing moves.
00:15:30.354 - 00:15:35.042, Speaker A: It's going to move, it's going to gap. That's how it always has been. To be clear, that's just looking at.
00:15:35.058 - 00:16:24.384, Speaker B: Bitcoin in trading terms, the way you're supposed to think about it, it's always been spot up volume. When spot goes up, normally volatility goes up with it because you get these really gappy illiquid moves and fomo, and people are short gamma and they got to cover. I definitely think that there's room for that kind of move to happen, but it's going to be really tough for that to happen absent risk assets doing well, which is going to be, again, really tough because a big long story on that. You're in a 5.5% interest rate environment now, and so it's tricky. Bitcoin, I think if we were in a two and a half percent environment, would be easier. It would be a lot higher.
00:16:24.384 - 00:16:26.356, Speaker B: But you can say that with anything.
00:16:26.420 - 00:16:29.228, Speaker A: We got the macro thing to worry about. That's all we can do.
00:16:29.276 - 00:16:30.022, Speaker B: Macro is a big.
00:16:30.108 - 00:16:36.298, Speaker A: Oh, it is for sure. This is a great conversation, bim, as always, great to have you, and we'll catch you next week, my friend.
00:16:36.346 - 00:16:36.554, Speaker B: Thank you.
