00:00:05.840 - 00:00:10.294, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, this is Mike Novogratz, next with Novo. And I'm here with Amanda Fabiano.
00:00:10.374 - 00:00:11.174, Speaker B: Amanda.
00:00:11.254 - 00:00:13.790, Speaker A: Amanda, I decided to make you a little more italian.
00:00:13.862 - 00:00:14.994, Speaker B: Yes. Here we are.
00:00:15.854 - 00:00:21.622, Speaker A: Amanda came from fidelity to run our mining practice, and so, Amanda, welcome.
00:00:21.718 - 00:00:25.926, Speaker B: Thanks, Mike. Thanks for having me here and just employed. I appreciate it.
00:00:26.030 - 00:00:33.356, Speaker A: It's good to be employed in the time of corona. So tell me about your crypto journey.
00:00:33.420 - 00:00:40.764, Speaker B: Yeah, so I started at Fidelity, and I started working in bitcoin world back in 2017 and where I actually met.
00:00:40.804 - 00:00:42.060, Speaker A: So you were a late convert?
00:00:42.132 - 00:01:06.828, Speaker B: I was a late convert, yeah. I definitely don't own enough bitcoin, so we'll get there. But I was a late convert. I started working on the education system at Fidelity, so I was leading, like, the internal. We called it a bits and blocks club, which is where we first met when you came as a speaker there, which was a lot of fun. And I feel like the world was very different than in bitcoin world. And just generally, I guess we could say, so started there.
00:01:06.828 - 00:01:33.052, Speaker B: We decided at fidelity that we wanted to expand our mining operation back around the same time frame. So worked on that. We purchased machines from different manufacturers, we put them in different locations, and really got to start to learn about just the mining ecosystem overall. It is such an important part of bitcoin that was really overlooked for a while, and so I started to really care more about it and then dig in even more.
00:01:33.108 - 00:01:40.028, Speaker A: So why should, like, the bitcoiner out there or the crypto person out there, why should they understand money? Why should they care about money?
00:01:40.076 - 00:01:54.996, Speaker B: So there's no bitcoin without bitcoin mining, right? Like, it's the underlying infrastructure of the entire ecosystem and network. I think that the two biggest areas that don't gain enough attention is mining and also bitcoin developers.
00:01:55.140 - 00:02:11.302, Speaker A: So miners, you know, people have all these preconceptions about what bitcoin mining is. It's dominated by China. It's polluting the world. Enlighten people a little bit about geography of where miners are located. Concentration of miners.
00:02:11.478 - 00:02:50.514, Speaker B: Mining has traditionally been centralized in China, and we're seeing that start to dissipate and be more global. So Cambridge center for Alternative Finance came out with a survey last year where they interviewed miners and asked where they were, etcetera, and there was about, I think, six or 7% of the network in North America, and we're seeing that grow even more. The area of mining that is concentrated in China are two areas. So there's one. A lot of the pools are based out of China. And then two, the mining manufacturing, like, the people who make the machines are all based out of China. So that's kind of where I would say, like, the concentration risk is versus, like, miners.
00:02:50.514 - 00:03:02.114, Speaker B: We're seeing more miners be distributed all over the world. So popping up in countries like Kazakhstan, Russia, North America, even Venezuela, they're all starting to mine more and more bitcoin.
00:03:04.544 - 00:03:18.624, Speaker A: So we're going to go back to bitcoin mining 101. We have electricity, we have chips, we have the guys that process the mines. We have these things called pools. So take us through one by one, how mining works.
00:03:18.664 - 00:03:25.112, Speaker B: Yeah. So you have the chips or the machines, and those are the application specific integrated circuit machines.
00:03:25.168 - 00:03:25.672, Speaker A: Asics.
00:03:25.768 - 00:03:28.336, Speaker B: Asics, yes. And the only thing they do is mine things.
00:03:28.360 - 00:03:29.244, Speaker A: And who makes those?
00:03:29.344 - 00:03:37.884, Speaker B: So there's a few manufacturers that make them. The biggest one is bitmain. There's micro bt, there's canon and silicon. And then Bitfury Ebang.
00:03:37.964 - 00:03:44.932, Speaker A: And so these are chips that are produced specifically for bitcoin mining. And they are fast as lightning.
00:03:44.988 - 00:03:51.564, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. So the more efficient they get, the better the odds are for you to win a block.
00:03:51.644 - 00:03:55.828, Speaker A: So I buy my chips, then I go to a hosting site or build my own.
00:03:55.836 - 00:03:56.984, Speaker B: You have your own hosting site?
00:03:58.134 - 00:04:00.494, Speaker A: And I start, I need electricity.
00:04:00.574 - 00:04:01.742, Speaker B: You need really low cost electricity.
00:04:01.758 - 00:04:07.446, Speaker A: And right now, what's low cost electricity? So there's eight cents, ten cents. Then it was $0.06. What is it now?
00:04:07.510 - 00:04:09.118, Speaker B: Right now you should be around three cents.
00:04:09.206 - 00:04:09.734, Speaker A: Three cents?
00:04:09.774 - 00:04:11.502, Speaker B: Yeah. So we've done some studies.
00:04:11.638 - 00:04:13.854, Speaker A: So table steaks is literally $0.03.
00:04:13.934 - 00:04:28.636, Speaker B: That's where you want to be. And that's where, like, your raw cost of electricity, it seems like that's around the median. Bituda did a report, actually, we worked with them on it when I was at fidelity. And they, you know, they looked across a lot of different mining companies, and that's where they think the middle ground is.
00:04:28.740 - 00:04:36.984, Speaker A: So I buy my chip from one of those manufacturers, I find a place that gives me three cent electricity. I pay some fee for them to process.
00:04:37.484 - 00:04:42.364, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. So you pay a hosting fee for them to just pay for their electricity and plug you in?
00:04:42.484 - 00:04:44.652, Speaker A: I take my mine and I.
00:04:44.828 - 00:04:46.452, Speaker B: You can plug it into a pool. Yep.
00:04:46.508 - 00:04:47.612, Speaker A: So explain what a pool is.
00:04:47.668 - 00:05:05.156, Speaker B: So a pool is where miners just pool their hashrate together so that their odds are better of mining bitcoin. And so it's just like the thing that you're competing is your hash rate against the network hash rate. And the larger your hashrate is whether that's like just your own machines or with a pool, the more odds you are, the more odds you have to win.
00:05:05.220 - 00:05:07.304, Speaker A: So this takes the randomness out of it.
00:05:07.844 - 00:05:18.900, Speaker B: It takes way out of it more than if it was just like a small mining operation, because you would need a lot of computing power to mine one block in a day. And unless you have that, you should always use a pool.
00:05:19.012 - 00:05:22.812, Speaker A: So now the pool gets a small fee. What's the pool's fee?
00:05:22.868 - 00:05:43.144, Speaker B: So pools fees have been actually being reduced because pools as a standalone service has been changing. So pool fees now can be anywhere from, like 0% sometimes depending on your operating. 2%. Yeah, 0% to go. Percent, but, yeah. So it depends on how big your operation is, what your relationship is with the pool. But standard is, I'd say, like one to 2%.
00:05:43.444 - 00:05:49.508, Speaker A: So now after the pool, I get my bitcoin back and I can keep my bitcoin, or I can sell them for dollars. I can do whatever I want with them.
00:05:49.556 - 00:05:51.948, Speaker B: And you have these new, freshly minted bitcoin?
00:05:52.036 - 00:05:52.428, Speaker A: Yes.
00:05:52.516 - 00:05:53.884, Speaker B: Beautiful, beautiful bitcoins.
00:05:53.924 - 00:06:06.258, Speaker A: I love them. Beautiful. All right. And so the economics, I'm spending dollars to buy machines, or I guess I could spend bitcoin to buy machines and the host. When does bitcoin mining make the most money, and when does it lose money?
00:06:06.346 - 00:06:19.626, Speaker B: So there's two denominators that you want to think about with bitcoin mining. So there's price and hash rate. So those two things usually work in parallel with each other. So as bitcoin price increases, hash rate will follow, because hashrate is the difficulty.
00:06:19.650 - 00:06:20.514, Speaker A: Of mining a bitcoin.
00:06:20.554 - 00:06:29.266, Speaker B: Hash rate is just like the overall network of, like, all the machines that are on the network. Right. So it's just like the amount of power that is being given to the bitcoin.
00:06:29.290 - 00:06:32.202, Speaker A: So the more hash rate goes up, the harder it is to find a bitcoin.
00:06:32.218 - 00:06:33.018, Speaker B: That's right. Yep.
00:06:33.106 - 00:06:34.814, Speaker A: So you can call it the difficulty.
00:06:35.154 - 00:07:06.430, Speaker B: The difficulty adjusts every two weeks, and then the hash rate is just like the measure of what's out there on the network. So when you think about, like, when is a good time to mine bitcoin, it is like, really at all times, because you can mine a bitcoin lower than you can buy it on, just like the open market. So as long as you're willing to put up money, like the capital costs for machines and for infrastructure or for machines and for colocation, you're going to continuously mine bitcoin below the cost that you can buy it on. The network.
00:07:06.582 - 00:07:10.726, Speaker A: And so what now? Right. We're seeing. We're seeing tons of people wanting to come into the mining space.
00:07:10.790 - 00:07:11.862, Speaker B: Yeah. Cause it's a bull market.
00:07:11.918 - 00:07:18.510, Speaker A: Cause it's a bull market. And it's hard to get in bitcoin mining. A because bitcoin's already moved, but it's also hard because you can't get the chips.
00:07:18.622 - 00:07:18.870, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:18.902 - 00:07:19.870, Speaker A: So talk a little bit about that.
00:07:19.902 - 00:08:02.786, Speaker B: Yeah. The supply chain constraints at the ASIC level has been real and a lot real since we started doing this. So when I came over here in October, we had ordered machines and the timing was right, because now that as the bitcoin price is continuing to grow and everyone is really interested in mining, there's a few things that are going on. One, people are putting up large orders. So a lot of the public mining companies have announced that they're buying a ridiculous amount of machines over the course of the next year. Two, you have companies with large balance sheets getting into bitcoin mining, like seeing the value in it. And then three, you have companies that have been mining bitcoin for a while that now have, as bitcoin price goes up, they have more money to purchase machines.
00:08:02.786 - 00:08:05.770, Speaker B: So I think those three things have created this perfect storm.
00:08:05.842 - 00:08:22.018, Speaker A: Classic commodity cycles. Price goes up, everyone jumps in. Then there's too many people trying to do the same thing, and price goes down. Um, not necessarily of bitcoin itself, but of the profitability of mining. And that would be class. That would be the classic cycle.
00:08:22.106 - 00:08:32.538, Speaker B: Yeah. So the bitcoin. But bitcoin price. It's bitcoin price and hash rate that you care about. Right. So, right now, miners are super profitable. It's a great time to be a miner.
00:08:32.586 - 00:08:37.874, Speaker A: We've just moved price of bitcoin way up, and all the new machines that have been ordered aren't plugged in yet.
00:08:37.954 - 00:08:41.202, Speaker B: Yeah, they're starting to go online now. You can see the hash rate increasing, but.
00:08:41.258 - 00:08:43.581, Speaker A: So hash rate should spike like crazy.
00:08:43.657 - 00:08:49.269, Speaker B: I think that we'll see a steady incline of hash rate over the next year because we are sold out of machines.
00:08:49.381 - 00:09:03.477, Speaker A: So if I had a machine today, brand new machine, I plugged it in, I had three cent power. I paid a normal hosting fee. Roughly what dollar amount am I mining a bitcoin at?
00:09:03.565 - 00:09:20.140, Speaker B: So, let's see. That's a really good question, because it's all about your operation. I think that you can mine a bitcoin around. Like, I don't. I'd have to look at our models. Right. But maybe, like, around, like, six to eight k maybe right now.
00:09:20.212 - 00:09:22.004, Speaker A: So we should be mining, like, insane, right?
00:09:22.044 - 00:09:37.548, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The hardest thing is, like, to get back to, like, the supply chain of the Asics. Like, that is the hardest thing because there's a handful of people who own, like, producing these machines, and they're all dependent on the foundry, and there's only really, like, two foundries in the world that produce the integrated circuits.
00:09:37.596 - 00:09:38.276, Speaker A: TSMC.
00:09:38.380 - 00:09:39.798, Speaker B: TSMC and Samsung.
00:09:39.876 - 00:09:40.258, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:40.346 - 00:09:55.734, Speaker B: And so, you know, we think about, like, mining, and this is, like, my whole world, but if you zoom out, TSMC makes, like, computers for Apple. Right. They make, like, all different types of things for much larger companies than, like, the companies in the world that we live in.
00:09:57.994 - 00:10:05.242, Speaker A: We're understanding how mining works. We're understanding why it's hot right now, why the mining stocks are going high, because there's not a. People buy them as bitcoin proxies, and.
00:10:05.258 - 00:10:06.002, Speaker B: Mining is going up.
00:10:06.018 - 00:10:23.128, Speaker A: There's not allowed to. Not a lot of supply. ESG. People want a green world. We're sick of all the pollution. You got coal mining plants mining bitcoin. What's bitcoin's answer to ESG?
00:10:23.256 - 00:11:01.540, Speaker B: So, bitcoin miners are actually incentivized to use renewable energy because the cost of production is lower. And I think that that is really the way to go. One interesting area that has been popping up in mining and bitcoin has been this oil and gas production. Like, excess oil and gas, where the methane is flared, you can capture that and use that energy to mine bitcoin. So that's one really cool area that companies like Crusoe, upstream, data gam are all solving for. There's also the layer ones and Hodl ranches that are using the Texas energy grid and the load balancing management to take advantage of the low cost of electricity.
00:11:01.692 - 00:11:06.722, Speaker A: One thing that's interesting is you don't need that constant source of electricity.
00:11:06.778 - 00:11:07.922, Speaker B: No. No, you don't.
00:11:07.978 - 00:11:12.178, Speaker A: And so you can go to places in green energy where it doesn't work.
00:11:12.226 - 00:11:20.162, Speaker B: Perfectly, and you can take advantage of turning off your machines. Cause you can power down a mine in, like, five minutes.
00:11:20.218 - 00:11:20.570, Speaker A: Got it.
00:11:20.602 - 00:11:23.242, Speaker B: It's just turning off all of your machines and turning them back on.
00:11:23.258 - 00:11:25.978, Speaker A: So how did you ever think you were gonna become a minor?
00:11:26.106 - 00:11:34.202, Speaker B: I went to school for criminal justice, which is shocking. I started at fidelity and, like, workplace investments. Then I switched into our.
00:11:34.258 - 00:11:36.002, Speaker A: Sorry about those people that take it your job.
00:11:36.098 - 00:11:57.546, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, sorry. And then I switched to fidelity center for Applied Technology, and it really just was this just the shift of me, like, being like, hmm, what's this bitcoin thing? And then it just fell in my lap and then mining was so weird that I just had to know more about it and mining. There's some, like, crazy stories that exist in mining and I just find them all fascinating.
00:11:57.610 - 00:12:02.814, Speaker A: So what's galaxy going to do in mining? Why are you here and what are your plans?
00:12:03.524 - 00:12:06.972, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question, too. We're just getting started.
00:12:07.028 - 00:12:13.588, Speaker A: I guess I should know, since I'm your boss. Yeah, you should know that I want the audience to know. I want the audience to know what we're going to do in mining.
00:12:13.636 - 00:12:36.116, Speaker B: So I think that there's a lack of financial tools available for miners in the space right now. So we know that all miners are constantly looking for capital because it is this highly capital intensive business. But if we think about what mining is, you really are printing bitcoin. So we should be creating more robust financial tools for miners to be able to be smarter with their money. We're going to be mining on our own, which we already are.
00:12:36.180 - 00:12:36.724, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:12:36.844 - 00:12:44.516, Speaker B: Because I don't think that we shouldn't be creating financial tools unless we are a miner and understand the needs and desires that miners have.
00:12:44.540 - 00:12:47.124, Speaker A: So we're building up our own mining operations, which I think is great.
00:12:47.204 - 00:12:47.668, Speaker B: Yep.
00:12:47.756 - 00:12:49.084, Speaker A: We're lending money to miners.
00:12:49.164 - 00:12:49.824, Speaker B: Yep.
00:12:51.524 - 00:12:52.556, Speaker A: Who came up with Mifi.
00:12:52.620 - 00:12:54.116, Speaker B: That's a Ferraro special right there.
00:12:54.140 - 00:12:58.304, Speaker A: Chris Ferraro. We'll give him credit. Mifi. I like that. Derivatives.
00:12:58.644 - 00:13:05.070, Speaker B: So we're going to offer a full suite of products to miners that will utilize all of Galaxy's current potentials.
00:13:05.102 - 00:13:19.438, Speaker A: Right. So, like, spot and options. And how many potential counterparties for a company like Galaxy are there in mining? So, like, real substantial mining operations, both in North America and then abroad.
00:13:19.526 - 00:13:42.538, Speaker B: So we've. Since we've started this business unit, we've talked to over 55 different companies just to learn what they're doing. And they run the full gambit of, from ASIC manufacturers to energy producers, to energy providers, to actual co locations, to people who run their own mine proprietarily. I think that there is a ridiculous amount of people that are working on mining.
00:13:42.666 - 00:13:44.974, Speaker A: And what's a big mine?
00:13:46.194 - 00:13:50.858, Speaker B: A gigawatt. Like what? Huddle ranch is building a gigawatt? Yeah, I think that's a huge mine.
00:13:50.946 - 00:13:51.426, Speaker A: And what's that?
00:13:51.450 - 00:14:07.534, Speaker B: I think realistically, people are around probably like 30 to 50 mw. That would be big right now. And I think that we. We see people at all different sizes and it doesn't mean that they'll last or not last based on their size. It's really about their operational cost.
00:14:07.834 - 00:14:12.154, Speaker A: You drive your operational costs low enough, even in tough times, it puts the other people out of business.
00:14:12.234 - 00:14:12.962, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:14:13.098 - 00:14:13.690, Speaker A: Got it.
00:14:13.762 - 00:14:14.454, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:17.714 - 00:14:24.674, Speaker A: What else do you want to tell the audience about mining? You love mining. I have not met anybody in my life that likes bitcoin mining as much as a man.
00:14:24.754 - 00:14:40.834, Speaker B: It's just so cool and weird at the same time. It's awesome. So, yeah, no, I think sometimes it's hard to zoom out and talk about mining at, like, a one on one level because we've been so focused on it. The cool thing about mining is it's like its own little ecosystem.
00:14:40.954 - 00:14:54.774, Speaker A: What's it like to be a woman in crypto? Right. As a data point, I have a lot of Twitter followers, and when I look at, like, who follows me on Twitter, it's 85% men and 15% women. Did you?
00:14:55.394 - 00:15:10.732, Speaker B: I'm a pretty fiery person to begin with, so I don't really have any issues. I think that sometimes it would be nice to have a different perspective and women bring a different perspective in. So, like, our mining team is 50 50 at galaxy. We have half women, half men.
00:15:10.788 - 00:15:16.660, Speaker A: We're going for diversity at Galaxy. I tell you what, we spent a lot of time thinking about it. It is not easy in a space like crypto.
00:15:16.732 - 00:15:17.268, Speaker B: Yeah, it is.
00:15:17.316 - 00:15:18.180, Speaker A: But we are working on it.
00:15:18.212 - 00:15:43.932, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that there is also an option for us to skill people up in the space, too. And it doesn't have to have, like, mining specifically. You don't have to have an MBA. You don't have to have this, like, unbelievable background. You just have to be super passionate and knowledgeable about bitcoin. And so I think that, like, this space in particular is something that we can really just look for a different crowd that isn't like the traditional female mining team.
00:15:43.988 - 00:15:51.564, Speaker A: There they go. And then we're gonna eat you hats and we're gonna do a poster. What do your parents think about this?
00:15:51.724 - 00:16:10.296, Speaker B: My mom has literally no idea what I do. It's funny, I actually gave Frank at the block an idea that on thanksgiving, he should interview people with their parents and say, what is bitcoin? Cause I thought it would be such a funny little parody. Cause I don't think anyone's parents fully understand what they do. So one of my friends, my mom.
00:16:10.320 - 00:16:13.592, Speaker A: Knows when she sees the price go up, she calls me and says, good job, good job.
00:16:13.728 - 00:16:29.080, Speaker B: That's so funny. My mom's like, I have no idea what you do. But I'm very proud of you. Thanks, mom. My other friend, Josh, his grandmother thinks he works at the bitcoin company, which is, like, my favorite thing. He's like, how's the bitcoin company doing? You know, it's great.
00:16:29.192 - 00:16:29.896, Speaker A: It's doing well.
00:16:29.960 - 00:16:45.514, Speaker B: Yeah, we're doing great. Stock is up, so, yeah, I think, you know, it's difficult to talk about what you do, but I do remind my family all the time at the price that I told them to buy bitcoin at, and then the price that we're at, but they haven't caught on yet.
00:16:46.694 - 00:16:54.742, Speaker A: I have some friends that look at me and they get mad because. Why don't you tell me? I was like, dude, I've been on tv for seven straight years telling people about video.
00:16:54.798 - 00:16:55.726, Speaker B: How else could I tell you?
00:16:55.750 - 00:16:58.134, Speaker A: Why didn't you tell me? Fair point.
00:16:58.214 - 00:17:03.214, Speaker B: But I saw you joined Clubhouse, and you were telling, like, a lot of people about bitcoin.
00:17:03.254 - 00:17:05.374, Speaker A: I have been trying to reach new audiences.
00:17:05.414 - 00:17:24.142, Speaker B: Yeah, Clubhouse is, like, a fascinating place, and I'm very surprised at how many people join these calls, and then they have, like, very smart questions and just are genuinely curious about the space. So I think that we're seeing an uptick in this bull market. Like, obviously institutional, like we talked about, but retail and a different type of retail, which is great.
00:17:24.278 - 00:17:45.378, Speaker A: Awesome. Last question. We are in a book, bitcoin bull market. I mean, we've gone, I got a tattoo at 20,000, and we're already at 41 of my kids said, dad, what do you get your next tattoo? And I said, that's 500 on my arm. What will it be? A big dragon. I was born in the year of the Dragon, 1964. The next year, the dragon is 2024.
00:17:45.378 - 00:17:56.068, Speaker A: And I decided it's right about the time we should hit 500,000 bitcoin, which is what? Bitcoin will be roughly the same size as gold's market cap, 2024. Drag it on the arm.
00:17:56.116 - 00:17:56.676, Speaker B: I like it.
00:17:56.740 - 00:18:04.796, Speaker A: Maybe 2023, if things keep going at this pace. What do you think? Is this chapter one? Is this chapter ten? Are you worried that we're in a.
00:18:04.820 - 00:18:06.740, Speaker B: Bubble or we're not in a bubble?
00:18:06.852 - 00:18:07.468, Speaker A: Not in a bubble?
00:18:07.516 - 00:18:23.410, Speaker B: No, we're not in a bubble. I think we're just getting started. The influx of institutional capital that has been continuing to be thrown into bitcoin, I think, will keep the price relatively steady. I think the last bull run, it was primarily driven by retail, and this one just is, like, smarter money, so I don't think.
00:18:23.442 - 00:18:27.218, Speaker A: And we're going to see institutional capital come into the mining space pretty quick, is my intuition.
00:18:27.306 - 00:18:32.730, Speaker B: I hope so. I mean, it's like the easiest way to get bitcoin if you know the right person to figure it out for you.
00:18:32.762 - 00:18:34.082, Speaker A: Right? Amanda, thanks a ton.
00:18:34.138 - 00:18:34.602, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:18:34.618 - 00:18:37.994, Speaker A: This has been next with Novo, talking about bitcoin mining. We'll see you soon.
