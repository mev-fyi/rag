00:00:08.080 - 00:00:12.358, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, thanks for coming on, galaxy brains.
00:00:12.446 - 00:00:13.286, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.350 - 00:00:24.942, Speaker A: What a week. I mean, we're seeing material movement in bitcoin. You can see over our shoulder. My shoulder. The right now, as we record on Wednesday, it's $34,700 ish is the closer.
00:00:24.958 - 00:00:26.366, Speaker B: To 800, but who's counting?
00:00:26.430 - 00:00:34.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's. And we had a material, I mean, huge move earlier in the week. Absolutely. What do you make of this apparent renewed optimism?
00:00:34.894 - 00:01:14.946, Speaker B: I think it's entirely warranted heading into a catalyst that is highly probable. It was driven by a number of things, but one of the main things was a short squeeze, particularly in the option side of things. The street was generally positioned pretty short gamma into this break. In addition, you had a ton of folks shorting bitcoin at the yearly highs, and a ton of oi ended up getting wiped out on the perps. And folks saw the technical break, right. 32k was year to date highs. We broke through it pretty easily.
00:01:14.946 - 00:02:01.334, Speaker B: The 200 day moving average that was previously resistance held as support. And now we're. Once you were above 32k, you were above every relevant moving average and technical average you could think of. And so you had a technical breakthrough, a short gamma squeeze, a short positioning squeeze as well. On top of that, the folks that got absolutely blasted and all of those factors coming together. And now the question is, can we continue? And my opinion is an unequivocal yes. I think very few folks, anecdotally have caught this move, especially in the traditional community.
00:02:01.334 - 00:02:11.494, Speaker B: It's a rally that is under owned, under position. And so I think every hundred points higher is a lot more painful than every 100 points lower.
00:02:11.954 - 00:02:15.338, Speaker A: I mean, this is a 20% move from the range we were in just last.
00:02:15.386 - 00:02:21.032, Speaker B: But when you have Larry Fink coming on television and telling you he thinks about it as a safe haven, right.
00:02:21.088 - 00:02:22.072, Speaker A: A flight to quality.
00:02:22.168 - 00:02:54.966, Speaker B: A flight to quality. Like the world has changed. He like, the beauty about an institution like Blackrock or these tradfi institutions is that they institutionalize an asset by definition. By definition, they give it credence. And so it's not that bitcoin wasn't institutional before, but when Larry Fink puts the blackrock stamp on it, it's different. And it is different this time. And so what have we known always to be true? The liquidity available versus the potential demand.
00:02:54.966 - 00:03:32.460, Speaker B: But the potential demand, there's a huge imbalance. And I think we're just getting a taste of that. And this could be again another Minsky moment for markets where all of a sudden people realize, oh wait, we have this new asset. It has a role in investment portfolios and we can't ignore it now because every other institution is looking at it. And then here's the beauty about this, is that it becomes so self fulfilling. There's such a positive feedback loop to positive price action at the moment. Every percent higher, it becomes, oh, one of the better asset classes performance this year.
00:03:32.460 - 00:04:06.004, Speaker B: It gets better on a risk adjusted basis. The story, the thesis gets more credence. And so you have this convexity of opinion that isn't price based, but it's thought based. And so that's where you are in the market. And that's what these technical breaks are telling you, that when you're above a 200 week moving average or day moving average, it tells you there's a change in the trend and we know why. And so how do you trade things? You buy things going into a known catalyst.
00:04:06.044 - 00:04:06.284, Speaker A: Yep.
00:04:06.324 - 00:04:10.612, Speaker B: Yeah, that is what tradfi is I believe, going to do.
00:04:10.668 - 00:04:33.624, Speaker A: Yeah. And we've seen continued strength. It wasn't just the gamma squeeze or the technicals either, right to your point. It's this catalyst that people are really waking up to. Even, you know, we had a pullback after Monday's incredible rally, a minor one, and we're already back right where we were. Right. And it wasn't a big, I mean I think I saw it go as low as 33 at some point on Tuesday.
00:04:33.624 - 00:04:36.222, Speaker A: Still obviously way above where it was.
00:04:36.278 - 00:04:39.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean after a broke 32 was like 32 seven.
00:04:39.470 - 00:04:52.654, Speaker A: Yeah, like you can, exactly, like you can see and if you just watch prices just marching up like. So there's clearly a lot of demand out there. To your point, on returns, I mean I think at this level, bitcoin's up 110% this year.
00:04:52.694 - 00:04:54.422, Speaker B: Total return math every moment.
00:04:54.478 - 00:05:24.406, Speaker A: I know. So I mean it is basically the best performing asset of the year. I'm not going to mention that I did find two equities in the US which we won't talk about, but that are slightly better. But like it's, I mean those are individual companies. This is a giant global asset. Now we should say, I guess, you know, like in your mind, what could, what could harm even leading into ETF approval over the next couple of months? What could like make us bearish on bitcoin or what could impact it negatively in your mind?
00:05:24.590 - 00:06:03.748, Speaker B: Well, you know, I think a broader risk off move in markets, you know, if ten start taking out 5% and the curve starts steepening like crazy again. I think you'll see a continuation of the risk off move that you've seen in the Nasdaq and the S and P and everybody being like, oh, inflation's still a huge issue. QT is leading to bonds that have no bid and stuff. So you could go down that spiral of thinking for sure. In addition, you could have things like gold trade down because all of a sudden there's peace in Israel or, or ceasefire situation, or even the reverse.
00:06:03.796 - 00:06:12.596, Speaker A: Like, even if, I was gonna say, if we have increased geopolitical conflict and the world doesn't yet treat bitcoin as a flight to quality, right now it's.
00:06:12.620 - 00:06:20.364, Speaker B: Got a weird hybrid, but ultimately everybody is thinking that there is gonna be a God candle when an ETF is approved.
00:06:20.404 - 00:06:21.788, Speaker A: Right. So it's about positioning ahead of that.
00:06:21.836 - 00:06:32.472, Speaker B: Positioning ahead of that. And so folks are trying to pick their levels by dips. But basically you might have only between now and the ETF might be your.
00:06:32.488 - 00:06:34.304, Speaker A: Last month and a half ago, right?
00:06:34.384 - 00:06:37.192, Speaker B: Yeah. Together before that said candle. Potentially.
00:06:37.248 - 00:07:00.222, Speaker A: Potentially. Right. I agree. We think we put out a report, Chuck, Charles Yu on my team put out a report yesterday, on Tuesday, estimating, really, I think a very defensible and conservative estimate on the potential inflows to generic bitcoin ETF's and its impact on price. And, I mean, I think we think it could be big. Go check out the reports on our website. But without getting into it.
00:07:00.222 - 00:07:27.414, Speaker A: So I think there is plenty of reason to believe. I believe that there will be significant interest in the ETF. I think some people, it's interesting, the responses to that report were either you're overestimating or underestimating people either think, well, why would you buy it? You could already buy it on Coinbase or wherever else. Why would you need the ETF? Or there's these other products already in the market. It's like, well, the channel that has $47 trillion doesn't have access to those products. Right. And so that's why we think it could be big.
00:07:27.414 - 00:07:43.142, Speaker A: On the other hand, people are like, oh, it's too small. I think we said 15 billion in inflows in year one and 38 and year three. And people are like, it's gonna be 100 billion. Right. And there's really no way to know. We're just triangulating. But in any case, we see significant interest, I think, in demand and obviously the market's anticipating it.
00:07:43.238 - 00:08:02.856, Speaker B: Yeah. No, the long run, how much inflows it gets or not. It's gonna be tough to ballpark. But again, we go back to the main points. We know that the american capital markets, the best capital market ever in history. ETF's are good product ever to trade.
00:08:02.880 - 00:08:03.720, Speaker A: On them, to trade.
00:08:03.832 - 00:08:33.122, Speaker B: So I'm convinced that we have the recipe for a pretty aggressive price movement. Whether it's short term or long term, I think it doesn't matter. But for the big picture, like, is it too early to declare victory? Probably. I wanna do like a George Bush zero four, like, in front of mission accomplishment, mission accomplished moment, but without getting the approval. But if you do get it, it's just monumental.
00:08:33.258 - 00:08:37.210, Speaker A: You were, I wanna point out, you were. I think you literally raised the bit signal.
00:08:37.242 - 00:08:37.530, Speaker B: I did.
00:08:37.562 - 00:08:39.154, Speaker A: Two weeks ago on this podcast. Two weeks ago.
00:08:39.234 - 00:08:39.658, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:39.746 - 00:08:42.602, Speaker A: I mean, you said, I'm saying it here. I'm raising the bit signal.
00:08:42.698 - 00:08:44.482, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I just got to.
00:08:44.538 - 00:08:45.690, Speaker A: You got the spidey sense.
00:08:45.802 - 00:09:02.920, Speaker B: I had the spidey sense on the corn bitcoin. But it's also just the general level of frustration with central bankers and monetary policy. You consistently see these central bankers being asked about the fiscal situation.
00:09:03.032 - 00:09:04.536, Speaker A: They refuse to speak on it, right?
00:09:04.680 - 00:09:27.496, Speaker B: Well, they speak on it in a way that avoids the main question. They're like, well, our job is to respond to fiscal policy, is what they say, because that's, that's not their mandate. But ultimately, we're in a situation where we run $1.7 trillion in deficit. We have congressional leaders that are bifurcated. They can't, they actually can't form a.
00:09:27.520 - 00:09:29.152, Speaker A: Government at the moment effectively.
00:09:29.248 - 00:10:09.242, Speaker B: And you're paying a level of interest that's right now just insane. It's similar to spending on defense, or 15% of the budget on interest. And it's only compounding over time. This country is addicted to spending money it doesn't have. And there's no politicians that are like, well, there are a few, but it doesn't look like a situation that's gonna be addressed politically. And therefore, these central bankers need to properly talk about that and address that and that reality, but they choose not to. And in the face of just mounting and surging treasury supply, and they're not even buying it.
00:10:09.242 - 00:10:20.652, Speaker B: And so it's like, do you acknowledge that you gotta buy all this paper and do MMT forever and yield curve control? No, because that tells people that you have no control over the fiscal and like, that should, in theory, debase your currency.
00:10:20.708 - 00:10:29.404, Speaker A: Even Jamie Dimon, I think yesterday had a big quote about this, about how if you look at the recent history of the Fed. You should really not trust what they're saying about the future.
00:10:29.484 - 00:10:30.316, Speaker B: No, absolutely not.
00:10:30.340 - 00:10:30.692, Speaker A: Because they did.
00:10:30.708 - 00:10:57.544, Speaker B: Such a bad forecasting is so bad. I mean, it's just been so politically inacceptable to like criticize the Fed. But Jamie Dimon can do it now because one like, you know, he's the biggest bank and he saved them on whatever that bank that they bought was, but they need him now because all of the regional banks are in shit. And the only reason that we didn't have a huge banking crisis is because we spun up some random facility to give banks loans which was effectively favorable.
00:10:57.584 - 00:10:58.008, Speaker A: Fake money.
00:10:58.056 - 00:10:58.216, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:58.240 - 00:10:59.176, Speaker A: I mean, or free money.
00:10:59.280 - 00:11:00.976, Speaker B: Well, it's just expanding your balance sheet.
00:11:01.000 - 00:11:01.656, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:11:01.800 - 00:11:03.592, Speaker B: It was literally like doing more Qe.
00:11:03.648 - 00:11:04.192, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:04.328 - 00:11:46.518, Speaker B: From a taxpayer. Just these great terms where you can borrow at par on something that's worth effectively marked down. Right. And so it's just like every solution that we have to monetary policy and market incidents is print more money, lend more money, lend more dollars in swap lines, I will give you financing versus. And so if the entire premise of our monetary system is built on the ability to print more money, that's not a foundation that makes me comfortable. And it becomes ever present. Like when central bankers keep getting asked about it and they can't acknowledge the simple facts that their monetary policy is going to be entirely driven by fiscal and fiscal dominance.
00:11:46.518 - 00:11:48.462, Speaker B: And so anyway, I could rant.
00:11:48.478 - 00:11:54.054, Speaker A: That is our man Bimnet abibi. I love it. I love the ramp. Bimnetta bibi from galaxy trading. Thank you so much, as always.
