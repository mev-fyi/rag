And I don't want to characterize the commission's view except to say that I think we have been legally imprecise. And that's something that I think if we had started out, and I fault myself for this too if we had started out with greater legal precision around what we were talking about here, I think we would be in a better place because the Howey test, as everyone in crypto now knows, comes out of an orange grove case where the orange grove came along with a contract that the person who sold it would maintain this for you and you.
00:00:39.238 - 00:00:39.542, Speaker UNK: Wouldn'T have.
00:00:39.558 - 00:00:58.844, Speaker A: To do anything right. So this is buyer is getting this thing efforts of others just sit back and the profits will come to you. And so the point of that is that you can have anything at the center of an investment contract, any kind of thing. It can be an, it can be a chinchilla or it can be an orange grove.
