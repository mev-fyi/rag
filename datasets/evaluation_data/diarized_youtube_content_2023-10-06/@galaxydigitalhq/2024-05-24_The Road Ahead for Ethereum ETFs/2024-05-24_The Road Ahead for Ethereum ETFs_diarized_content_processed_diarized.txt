00:00:07.880 - 00:00:11.862, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:11.918 - 00:00:12.678, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:12.726 - 00:00:13.542, Speaker C: Love your sneakers.
00:00:13.598 - 00:00:18.278, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. I took off the. You didn't like the low, the Nike dunks I was wearing. I don't want to eat.
00:00:18.326 - 00:00:19.222, Speaker B: He's wearing pandas.
00:00:19.278 - 00:00:42.156, Speaker A: Apparently they're just kind of playing not okay. Yeah, well, look, I mean, the big news in our market this week is this apparent 180 shift in the ETH, ETF approval process with the SEC. We don't have to go in depth on this because we also have Eric Balchunis coming up next on the show to talk about that specifically. But either that or what else is on your mind in markets this week when you're watching the lines and numbers?
00:00:42.260 - 00:01:14.734, Speaker B: Yeah, ETF, definitely. Very notable, most notable thing in crypto. I think it represents a big shift in the sort of political and regulatory landscape for crypto. I think the ramifications will be felt for years to come. As far as the actual product that the ETF is providing, I think there are some obvious deficiencies in terms of staking and fees and the ability to do stuff on chain and stuff, but I'm assuming Dalcunis will go through that stuff.
00:01:14.814 - 00:01:43.530, Speaker A: I agree with that. By the way, we were talking about this earlier. I feel like the delta in functionality between the spot and the ETF for bitcoin is much narrower than the delta between the spot and ETF for ETH in that you can't buy, you can't send or receive on chain your bitcoin if it's in an ETF and you don't, and you lack self custody, so you don't have the same level of censorship resistance. But if you're a hodler. Yeah, those are really hoddling. Yeah.
00:01:43.602 - 00:01:47.444, Speaker B: If you're a hodler, the ETTF is not a great product.
00:01:47.524 - 00:01:49.684, Speaker A: Right. Because you would stake, you might even restake.
00:01:49.764 - 00:01:50.044, Speaker B: Correct.
00:01:50.084 - 00:01:56.908, Speaker A: You certainly can't. And ethereum is, I think been successful because it has such a robust on chain financial market.
00:01:57.036 - 00:01:57.372, Speaker B: Correct.
00:01:57.428 - 00:01:58.340, Speaker A: Which you can't access.
00:01:58.452 - 00:01:58.764, Speaker B: Correct.
00:01:58.804 - 00:02:07.436, Speaker A: So like there's many more features of Ethereum that you can't use if you do the ETF. But, you know, nonetheless, it's also highly convenient to hold an ETF. We talked about how it's no.
00:02:07.460 - 00:02:29.984, Speaker B: And you can get margin financing for it. And so there are some benefits. But fundamentally for folks looking to buy and hold for the future, you're in a product that is not ideal. The ideal form of owning ETH is you own ETH, you stake it, maybe you restake it and you self custody it.
00:02:30.644 - 00:02:48.106, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. Still a sea change, though. And probably a similar class of investor that we've highlighted, primarily the advisors on the wealth platforms, the bank and broker dealer platforms. They really can't put their clients into some stake product. I'm not aware of. One for them, I think a big deal, but anyway. Yeah, we'll see.
00:02:48.130 - 00:02:51.170, Speaker B: And then the grayscale product also charges you a 2% management fee.
00:02:51.202 - 00:03:01.778, Speaker A: Yeah, we're not sure what they're going to do with that. Right. I mean, they were two at GVDC, and then they lowered it to 1.5%, which is still what's five times higher than the average other competitors.
00:03:01.906 - 00:03:09.650, Speaker B: But there's $11 billion of eats supply that is now available to be redeemed at some point.
00:03:09.682 - 00:03:24.808, Speaker A: I should say, too. We get more into this with Baltunus, but we don't know exactly when these would go live yet. What we're talking about is the 19 b four process. Let's move on. Cause we got a whole conversation with Eric after this about that. What else are you looking at? I mean, it doesn't feel like a huge macro week. Really?
00:03:24.936 - 00:03:25.264, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:25.304 - 00:04:06.556, Speaker B: You know, I think what's notable in macro has been the strength in the commodity complex recently. Gold is hovering around high. 2300 has broke through 2400 all time high areas. You know, silver had a breakout through 30 multi year highs, looking like it wants to trend higher. We've seen things like platinum trade. Well, today, Nat gas was on a tear because of some concerns in Europe around shortage. And so there's a lot of commodities that have become very topical and kind of uncorrelated to broader markets.
00:04:06.556 - 00:04:57.346, Speaker B: And those things are very notable. And a lot of the change you're seeing in those markets is very structural in nature in terms of foreign central banks and foreign sovereign wealth funds. And really thinking through the de dollarization, the focus on kind of hard assets. And so you've seen basically the Chinese buy a ton of gold, like places like India buy silver, and that, again, to kind of get away from the US dollar in a way. And then ultimately, I think what matters for markets on the next six months is really the election. You've got two very different outcomes for markets based on who wins. We've talked about Trumponomics in two episodes ago.
00:04:57.370 - 00:05:00.042, Speaker A: It's a great conversation, by the way. You should go back and listen if you didn't hear that one.
00:05:00.138 - 00:05:44.238, Speaker B: But high level Trump means tariffs, which is inflationary. It means folks getting deported like crazy. So labor shortages also probably means permanent tax cuts and increases in defense spending. So it's very inflationary and also for the geopolitics presents some more risks. And so that's kind of the inflationary backdrop. I think either president is probably going to be good for stocks, and then on the other side, you might have some tax increases, you might have, I would say both parties, whoever wins is going to be bad for the fiscal situation.
00:05:44.406 - 00:05:50.438, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say doesn't feel like Trump didn't cut when he was in office. He spent a lot. They're both populists, really.
00:05:50.606 - 00:06:32.316, Speaker B: Exactly. And so I would say in the Biden administration as well, you're probably going to see a more honest reaction to inflation from fed officials in terms of their willingness to potentially even hike rates or hold rates higher for longer versus under Trump, he's going to appoint officials that are going to be more inclined to cut sooner rather than later. And treasury policy, that's a little bit more lenient. It's a tale of two presidents and that I think as you start to see the Trump odds increase or decrease, you'll see the market move in one direction or the other. But those are really, I mean, the election is really the next big thing.
00:06:32.380 - 00:06:35.076, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a big deal for crypto, too. We're starting to find out.
00:06:35.260 - 00:06:37.476, Speaker B: Like I was saying, crypto might win either way.
00:06:37.540 - 00:07:02.282, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, I mean, it does, I think it almost can't have gotten worse than the prior couple years. So I think it probably does get better even if the current administration stays. Here's the thing. You were talking about crypto, too. 2012, Obama's reelection to 2016, was crypto higher or lower? Actually, actually in that one, I think it was higher. Well, it was actually, it was higher. It actually did get high at the beginning and then was low.
00:07:02.282 - 00:07:12.602, Speaker A: Let's try this one again. 2016, Trump starts his election. He gets elected. He comes out in 2020. Did bitcoin end up higher or lower during that administration? A lot higher.
00:07:12.658 - 00:07:13.610, Speaker B: A lot higher? Sure.
00:07:13.722 - 00:07:31.958, Speaker A: Ok. 2020, Biden comes in and it's about to be 24. You think at the end of 20, the start of 2020, was bitcoin higher or lower in his administration tonight? A lot higher. So Trump or anyone wins in November, 4 years from now, 2028, what do you think? Bitcoin higher or lower?
00:07:32.006 - 00:07:37.674, Speaker C: Well, you sure are higher, but you can say that about any risk asset, basically. That's true.
00:07:38.774 - 00:07:40.462, Speaker B: It's the stock market, it's inflation.
00:07:40.518 - 00:07:41.014, Speaker A: That's a good point.
00:07:41.054 - 00:07:43.486, Speaker C: It's insane. Inflation.
00:07:43.550 - 00:07:59.698, Speaker A: Yeah. That original Obama one is pretty bad because actually there was that big peak in 20, 12, 13 where it hit like 1300 bucks. And then actually in 20, 1516, he was down in like the two to $500 range. So actually that one was lower. But I'm just saying. Yeah, like, I think we're higher no matter what. I think we're probably.
00:07:59.698 - 00:08:03.154, Speaker A: And part of that might also be fiscal too. I mean, like you said, it's fiscal.
00:08:03.194 - 00:08:05.666, Speaker C: But it's also just so many structural.
00:08:05.770 - 00:08:08.226, Speaker B: Things that are happening all at once.
00:08:08.330 - 00:08:08.666, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:08.730 - 00:08:51.664, Speaker B: You know, you take the AI stuff, right? In terms of, you know, you've got to re engineer power grids to take into account that the AI processing data centers are going to be super energy. It's the infrastructure stuff that has to get done. It's the onshoring. It's all of these things that are structural in nature that are going to get done over the next couple of years. On top of that, you're talking about a government that spends over 5% of GDP in deficit spending. When you throw in the fiscal impulse, on top of the huge structural changes that the economy is about to go through, it's really hard to see how growth does not remain elevated in the US.
00:08:51.744 - 00:08:54.272, Speaker C: And that should be good for risk assets.
00:08:54.368 - 00:08:55.324, Speaker A: Yeah, it should.
00:08:56.344 - 00:09:00.324, Speaker B: And yeah, the inflation shit is so bad.
00:09:01.024 - 00:09:01.824, Speaker A: So sticky.
00:09:01.904 - 00:09:03.016, Speaker C: It's so sticky.
00:09:03.120 - 00:09:05.904, Speaker A: And when you actually walk around your daily life, it feels high.
00:09:05.984 - 00:09:06.604, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:07.104 - 00:09:16.604, Speaker B: And really what it is is I just constantly feel like these central bankers are just misrepresenting and basically lying to everyday people.
00:09:17.384 - 00:09:18.752, Speaker A: It's like gaslighting.
00:09:18.928 - 00:09:19.912, Speaker C: It's so insane.
00:09:20.008 - 00:09:34.040, Speaker A: No, no, inflation's like getting lower and it's pretty lower. It's up slightly over a couple of months, but it's like still. And it's like, I was trying to order. I looked to a deli that I used to like to order from in New York. Like not an expensive place. $18.95 for a chicken quesadilla.
00:09:34.040 - 00:09:40.754, Speaker A: 18. Granted this is lower Manhattan, but I'm just saying like some guy, dude, it's a tortilla with cheese and some chicken.
00:09:40.864 - 00:09:49.954, Speaker B: Yeah, $20. I was in a chat with somebody the other day. This guy ordered like a burrito and nachos in Chicago for pickup on an app. It was $36.
00:09:51.254 - 00:09:52.414, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:09:52.534 - 00:10:22.864, Speaker C: But it's not about that. It's about the genuine honest conversation that people need to have out loud. Powell can't go up on tv and be like, I can't control for fiscal, like somebody needs to go on tv and tell me this shit is bad. Do the math. For the next ten years, somebody needs to tell the american people that this is what our liabilities look like on a go forward basis. Right. We have to keep the dollar as it does.
00:10:22.904 - 00:10:46.478, Speaker A: Feel like in a more classic, iconic american age, somebody like a Powell would stand up and tell the truth. Cause it matters for the country. Don't give me this like, oh, well, the politics and bureaucracy of the Fed versus the treasury. I'm not supposed to, like, get to. No, dude. Country could. Who cares about that divide if the country collapses because you guys screw this whole thing up? Please, somebody stand up and be an adult about it.
00:10:46.526 - 00:11:13.612, Speaker C: But also, the issue is, it's just like, if there was a 30 year old that was the Fed chairman, we would be enacting different policies and very afraid Congress was like, 35 year olds, right? It's just so different. We're so nearsighted, and the long term impacts are insane. Think about running five to 6% deficits ad infinitum portion of the budget is going to be paying interest in 15 years.
00:11:13.668 - 00:11:14.660, Speaker A: What? All of it?
00:11:14.812 - 00:11:18.452, Speaker C: How are people not freaking out about this and ringing the bell?
00:11:18.508 - 00:11:22.876, Speaker A: You won't have money for anything, republican or democratic stuff that you want.
00:11:23.020 - 00:11:25.044, Speaker C: And I'm like, come on, people.
00:11:25.164 - 00:11:26.224, Speaker A: It is math.
00:11:26.884 - 00:11:30.164, Speaker C: You need to cut spending and raise taxes immediately.
00:11:30.204 - 00:11:31.788, Speaker A: Everyone knows this. This is the pure math.
00:11:31.876 - 00:11:35.356, Speaker C: But you can't do it. Cause it's an election cycle. It's so messy.
00:11:35.380 - 00:11:36.796, Speaker A: And it's always an election cycle.
00:11:36.860 - 00:11:56.558, Speaker C: Like, whoa, well, that's a structural issue. You're telling me Congress guy's got to get elected every two years, senators every six. Like, he's running to, like, get. Raise money three months into the job. He's like, oh, I'm on the phone fundraising. Instead of being like, how do I fix this stuff for my constituents? But it's. It's absolutely asinine.
00:11:56.646 - 00:12:03.982, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. Well, hey, look, we're building an alternative that you could maybe opt out with. At least bitcoin is that story.
00:12:04.038 - 00:12:12.194, Speaker C: But it's. I mean, I love it, but. But it's like, you know, it doesn't solve the main issue. Not everybody has bitcoin.
00:12:12.234 - 00:12:12.770, Speaker A: No.
00:12:12.922 - 00:12:23.770, Speaker C: Right. And, like, yes, that's a great way for people that already have money to store their wealth, because it will. But for the folks that don't right. Like it, putting them in worse and.
00:12:23.802 - 00:12:41.174, Speaker A: Worse situations, 100% and separately, like, bitcoin or not, we have a country that we care about and love. And the math is pretty straightforward. And they won't tell us this. They keep us focused on, like, the next month, the next FOMC meeting, the next earnings call. Like, it's. No, dude. Like, someone's got to take a long view on this thing.
00:12:41.214 - 00:12:48.166, Speaker C: Somebody's not taking a lot. But my part of the issue, though, is, like, I don't know how many of these politicians in Congress genuinely understand the issue.
00:12:48.230 - 00:12:49.326, Speaker A: I don't think they do.
00:12:49.510 - 00:12:51.046, Speaker C: And like that, I saw a guy.
00:12:51.070 - 00:12:58.334, Speaker A: Stand up now during the fit 21 debate. The guy has no idea what he's talking about. He's clearly been given this. He was proposing amendment. I don't think he's ever spoken before in Congress.
00:12:58.454 - 00:13:02.438, Speaker C: You're probably like, here you go, Biden administration economic official the other day.
00:13:02.486 - 00:13:02.910, Speaker A: No, which one?
00:13:02.942 - 00:13:05.034, Speaker C: Being asked about, oh, how does money work?
00:13:05.564 - 00:13:08.500, Speaker A: You're talking about the one in the documentary, Stephanie Kelton's documentary.
00:13:08.532 - 00:13:17.344, Speaker C: I mean, that guy, you got guys that went on the House floor being like, global warming doesn't exist because I got snow in my hand. Like, it is absolutely asinine.
00:13:17.644 - 00:13:29.364, Speaker A: Oh, man. Well, you're not asinine, my friend. Thanks for coming on, Galaxy brains. We'll check in with you next week. Maybe we'll be more, we'll have more numbers of data or something to talk about, my friend. They met at BB Galaxy training. Thanks so much.
00:13:29.444 - 00:13:29.964, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
