00:00:00.400 - 00:00:49.279, Speaker A: Now, just to kind of go through that final. What does the next chapter look like? I generally look at the market following a bear market, which, if anyone's been through a bitcoin bear, you know, it's a brutal process and there's a recovery time frame, right? It takes time for capital, the ptsd, all of these things are just going to heal. And if you look at every single previous cycle, this duration, about 700 days, since the bottom is about how long it takes to really kickstart the thing into the next. The next wave. Now, once we bust through all time high, we enter what I call the euphoria phase. This is when we truly start moving, right? This is the parabolic phase everyone looks at. I believe that there's like a time frame on that, because if anyone's been through a bull, you know that you get to the end of it and you're exhausted, you're just tired, everything's going higher and you're like, you know what? I just want to go on holidays.
00:00:49.279 - 00:00:55.895, Speaker A: Like, every coin under the sun's moving. There's only so long investors can do that for. Historically, it's been between six and 18 months.
