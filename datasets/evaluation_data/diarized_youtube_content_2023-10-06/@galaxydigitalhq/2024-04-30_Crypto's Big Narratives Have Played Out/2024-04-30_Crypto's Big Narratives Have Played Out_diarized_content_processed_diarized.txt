00:00:00.440 - 00:00:07.758, Speaker A: You had the havening, you had the ETF. A lot of the big narratives for crypto have played out, to be frank.
00:00:07.806 - 00:00:08.342, Speaker B: That's right.
00:00:08.438 - 00:00:23.846, Speaker A: And so a lot of times markets need catalysts and markets need. And especially in such a speculative asset like bitcoin, people like to see good momentum to continue to participate. And so to the hardcore bitcoiners, this is just noise.
00:00:23.950 - 00:00:25.118, Speaker B: Or maybe just like.
00:00:25.166 - 00:00:26.958, Speaker A: Path to people who are like, this.
00:00:26.966 - 00:00:27.878, Speaker B: Is great, we can stack.
00:00:27.966 - 00:00:34.896, Speaker A: We can stack. Everybody that's in the bitcoin game is like, I need more time to get more bitcoin, right? Like, I gotta have more.
00:00:34.960 - 00:00:52.104, Speaker B: But it's obvious, I mean, if you look at the ETF flows as one version, like you can just see like huge run in February and March and then April's been kind of like basically almost more anemic every day. I think we might have decided that we bottomed, I think to last week. We had, I think, basically the lowest total inflow ever.
