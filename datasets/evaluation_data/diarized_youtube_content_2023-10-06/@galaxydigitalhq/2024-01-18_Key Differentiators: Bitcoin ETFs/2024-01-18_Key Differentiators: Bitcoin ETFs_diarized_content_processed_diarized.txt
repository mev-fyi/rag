00:00:00.080 - 00:00:08.622, Speaker A: So let's get into the ETF a little bit. So they start trading today. It's crazy. It's actually. I'm still having, like. It's not. I don't know what it is.
00:00:08.622 - 00:00:23.838, Speaker A: It's like a physical sensation, though. For how long we've been waiting for this. There are eleven, I believe, applicants, I think maybe ten. I think hashtags actually might not be in this round. And theirs is different. They're adding spot to an existing product. I don't know.
00:00:23.838 - 00:00:43.194, Speaker A: I asked this for Eric Balchunis, who is on this episode too. What's like in your mind? Like, I'm not gonna ask you for a prediction in inflow. And again, think of the whole complex, not any specific one. But is there a number that's like, holy crap, this is a blowout, smash win. And is there a number that's like, oh, crap, it's a flop in your mind?
00:00:43.774 - 00:00:59.174, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I'll work backwards in any context in asset management, but also in ETF's. I think that aum is an output, not an input. And so you can control what you can control. And that's about the process. And so I do think it's a mistake to say all these ETF's are the same.
