00:00:25.915 - 00:01:10.185, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of Firmware research at Galaxy Bitcoin Not Zero. And we have an interesting episode for you today. Thad Pinakavich from Galaxy Research is going to join us to talk to us about World Liberty Financial, the pre launch forthcoming defi application on Ethereum that is backed by the Trump family. He's going to share what we know about it. Of course we'll check with our good friend Pimnet at BB from Galaxy Trading as always to talk about markets, cpi, print today, FOMC coming up I think next week, so it should be interesting. And before we get to that I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities.
00:01:10.185 - 00:01:19.365, Speaker A: Let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:19.445 - 00:01:20.469, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:20.597 - 00:01:39.595, Speaker A: So we had the. It's kind of a week, although not a lot is really. I've not seen a lot of movement in markets necessarily, but we had the presidential debate last night which I guess we could talk about briefly. And then obviously the big economic news is we have the CPI numbers for last month published today. What did they show?
00:01:39.895 - 00:02:51.453, Speaker B: Yeah, they showed a relatively strong rebound in owner's equivalent rent and in shelter which drove the core CPI reading to come in at 0.28 versus expectations of 0.2%. The market really latched onto that in terms of deciding whether or not 25 basis point cut is more likely than a 50 basis point cut. We saw that meeting reprice much closer to 25 basis points today as a function of this beat in core CPI and high level. I think what folks have been concerned with on the inflation side has been the past strength in services CPI which we had seen cooling. And so the fact that you had this rebound in shelter today made folks pause a little bit. But in terms of what's driving the overall response function of the Fed, I would say that inflation data is probably the least important part of their mandate at the moment.
00:02:51.453 - 00:02:54.965, Speaker B: They're most focused on the employment side of things.
00:02:55.045 - 00:03:01.901, Speaker A: Yeah, and where do we stand on that at the moment? Whatever the latest data is? I mean was it ADP like 2 weeks ago or something like that?
00:03:01.933 - 00:03:50.793, Speaker B: Or we got non farm payrolls last week and that showed a Modest decline in the pace of job growth, which was super important. And you're starting to see basically below neutral rate payroll growth. It's starting to get concerning. And you've also seen a meaningful uptick in the unemployment rate as well. Then you had the revisions, the 850,000 revisions from prior month. And then in addition, the last nonframp payrolls, you revised lower the prior months by 2030,000 jobs. And also if you look a little bit deeper, job openings saw a huge decline the other week.
00:03:50.793 - 00:04:22.583, Speaker B: The past job opening numbers were also revised lower. And then digging a bit deeper in terms of where you're seeing strength and weakness in the labor market, the strength has been in things like government sector jobs and the, the weakness has been in private sector jobs. Not great, not great. And so in addition, you've had, if you look at the job opening data, it's like job openings for white collar stuff and coding jobs, they've tech jobs falling off.
00:04:22.639 - 00:04:23.275, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:23.935 - 00:05:02.101, Speaker B: And then if you really want to analyze some of the initial jobless claim figures, I think folks are coming around to a more nuanced appreciation of these figures from the sense that like now when you lose your job, you've got a lot more options in the gig economy in terms of what you can do, Right. So you get unemployed and all of a sudden you can probably pick up 20 hours at like 15 to 20 bucks an hour, doordash or Uber, whatever it may be. And so you see less people filing for unemployment benefits, but they're not real.
00:05:02.173 - 00:05:03.901, Speaker A: Strong longer term jobs.
00:05:03.973 - 00:05:50.663, Speaker B: And so if you look at other metrics like the underemploy employment rate, the U6 employment rate, those things are, I think that's almost at 8% now. And so ultimately, in terms of what the market's going to be looking for on a go forward basis, they're going to want to know what the Fed is thinking on a go forward with respect to the job stuff. And they're going to find out in the summary of economic projections that are going to be released during the September fomc. And so in theory, what you should see is their forecast for unemployment for the balance of 2024 and 2025 and 2026 to start creeping higher. And also you will get insight into where they think the rate path is going to be on to go forward in terms of neutral rate.
00:05:50.839 - 00:06:14.313, Speaker A: So it's the dual mandate. The inflation is still present, it's still above target, but it's cooled pretty substantially over the year. But now unemployment is the question. The other part of Their mandate to seek what, full maximum employment, whatever the term is. And that's. But we're gonna get a rate cut next week though from the FOMC, though. That's right.
00:06:14.313 - 00:06:15.033, Speaker A: That's what everyone.
00:06:15.089 - 00:06:28.409, Speaker B: That's right. But it's not like necessarily a good thing which like a lot of folks in crypto and in broader markets, they're like, ah, Fed's cutting, we can buy risk assets again. But you really have to focus on why they're cutting.
00:06:28.457 - 00:06:29.569, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
00:06:29.617 - 00:06:32.445, Speaker B: They're cutting because the economy is losing moment.
00:06:32.545 - 00:06:36.173, Speaker A: Right. Which is a bigger negative sign for assets asset value.
00:06:36.229 - 00:06:49.306, Speaker B: Absolutely right, right. You're talking about like S and P earnings growth that's expected to be, let's say 9% next year and for the big tech companies expected to be like closer to 14.
00:06:49.432 - 00:06:49.935, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:50.061 - 00:07:29.971, Speaker B: And in 2025 you're also expecting a decent amount of growth in earnings. Right. And so there's a lot of optimism baked into the equity markets. Right. And then on top of that, like typically when you see unemployment rise, you typically get a bigger rise known as the SOM rule. I don't know how to say it properly, but all of the things that we look at in terms of being good indicators of what's going to happen on a go forward with respect to employment are flashing warning signs. And so again you walk through the example, guy goes from high paying job to a lower paying job or no job, he eats out less.
00:07:29.971 - 00:07:31.203, Speaker B: There's a multiplier effect.
00:07:31.259 - 00:07:32.747, Speaker A: Spends less, buys fewer things.
00:07:32.811 - 00:08:02.189, Speaker B: Fewer things also becomes more indebted because credit card balances are through the roof. They are right now interest rates are really high. And so it becomes a lot more difficult to service that and you fall into this debt trap. If asset prices start declining, that will lead to further asset price depreciation. And so there's a lot of bad things that can be precipitated by downturn. And so when folks are like, oh, it's great that the Fed's cutting, that should be good for risk.
00:08:02.277 - 00:08:02.985, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:03.525 - 00:08:04.605, Speaker B: But not really.
00:08:04.685 - 00:08:05.061, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:05.133 - 00:09:07.629, Speaker B: And then the other thing to think about is that the historical kind of analogy with respect to rate cuts is a little bit different now from the sense that the magnificent seven companies and a ton of companies in the US used to hold or currently hold tons of cash balances versus historically companies used to not have that much cash on their balance sheets because they had more productive uses of it, et cetera, and they hadn't gotten so big. But now a lot of the magnificent seven tech companies, etcetera they carry huge cash balances. When interest rates are rising, their net interest income was actually going up a lot. So in theory, on the way down, their net interest income should also be going down. And so the classic rate cuts are coming, so equities should do well. It doesn't necessarily hold. It's a lot more nuanced than that, especially when you've got so much baked in.
00:09:07.629 - 00:09:31.903, Speaker B: Look at a five year chart of the Nasdaq or the S and p or a 10 year chart. Risk markets are at the dead highs. And so I think we're at the point in the cycle where one should be cautious about risk assets and should really look into why we're engaging in a cutting path and why the bond market is telling you that the Fed is going to be very aggressive over the next nine months.
00:09:31.999 - 00:10:11.587, Speaker A: Interesting. Well, we do have a monetary instrument that does not have a team of people meeting every month to adjust its inflation rate. You have to wonder is the sort of, I guess what I'm pivoting here to obviously is the Bitcoin. Is it when, if ever, is it now? It probably isn't yet. Now does bitcoin transition to being something that is more of a fundamental asset and not a risk asset? I mean, that's sort of the question, right, for long term bitcoin investors, presumably. It's not always a risk asset, right? I mean risk assets have management execution risk, they have things like interest rate risk. They have all these risks, that's what makes them risky.
00:10:11.651 - 00:10:16.665, Speaker B: I don't know if you'll ever get to a point where Bitcoin coin isn't a risk asset.
00:10:17.405 - 00:10:19.325, Speaker A: I mean, gold's not a risk asset, right?
00:10:19.445 - 00:10:45.273, Speaker B: It has some elements of that to it in terms of just looking at its performance. At the end of the day, it's an asset people own and people get impacted by how they feel. And in terms of how you run a portfolio, even in the depths of the financial crisis, gold is a great owner, but it still went down in 2008 because everything goes to correlation one and risk off events.
00:10:45.329 - 00:10:45.833, Speaker A: That's right.
00:10:45.929 - 00:11:24.723, Speaker B: And so you're never going to really avoid that. But I do think that it just will set higher and higher floors with respect to when risk sells off, et cetera. I do think that in theory folks aren't going to sell their bitcoin at certain levels. And so ultimately I do think you're in the path of setting higher and higher floors in the price and ultimately you should start to go higher. And truly when I do think the Bitcoin will have its moment again from a macro standpoint is when the money printing actually starts.
00:11:24.779 - 00:11:26.907, Speaker A: When it really starts. Not just some rate cuts, but not.
00:11:26.931 - 00:11:53.819, Speaker B: Some rate cuts, but it's like we're going back to balance sheet expansion. We're going to buy a ton of the debt that the US Government issues by printing money. And so that's when you really are going to get that what is money, if we could just print it out of thin air and buy stuff. And so when the market gets that sense that you're close to that kind of event is kind of when I think bitcoin will have it.
00:11:53.867 - 00:12:06.957, Speaker A: That's the macro bitcoin moment. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, my friend, thank you. Let's go now to our guest, Thaddeus Pinakovich, VP on Galaxy Research. Welcome, Thad, to the podcast.
00:12:07.021 - 00:12:08.277, Speaker C: Thanks for having me. It's good to be here.
00:12:08.341 - 00:12:40.225, Speaker A: Yeah. I was excited to talk to you because there's so much. Whether it's the election itself or just the Trumps in general. Well, one of the interesting things, along with the many NFT collections that Donald Trump has sold, is this new, I guess it hasn't launched yet, this new defi application on Ethereum called World Liberty Financial, which is apparently, I don't know, promoted by or backed by the Trump family. You looked into it. You wrote a note for our clients and counterparties about it. I don't know.
00:12:40.225 - 00:12:45.097, Speaker A: What is it? Just to start. I mean, what do we know is really why I wanted you to come on. But I don't know. What is it?
00:12:45.161 - 00:13:05.971, Speaker C: Yeah, well, it's not much right now. It's yet to launch, but it is a defi protocol based off of DOE Finance. So it was launched by a couple guys earlier this year, actually. It's a leverage looping protocol, so allows you to deposit ETH or stablecoins, borrow against it and then loop it back.
00:13:06.043 - 00:13:13.907, Speaker A: Deposit it again and again and again and again. So you're juicing your borrow, your earning yield, basically with leverage.
00:13:14.011 - 00:13:17.579, Speaker C: Yeah, if you're earning yield or take a directional if you're depositing eth and doing it that way.
00:13:17.627 - 00:13:17.787, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:17.811 - 00:13:18.219, Speaker A: I see.
00:13:18.307 - 00:13:21.003, Speaker C: Similar to like Celsius back in the day, but a bit more automated.
00:13:21.099 - 00:13:24.227, Speaker A: Got it. This was the DeFi application. Doe Finance.
00:13:24.291 - 00:13:33.055, Speaker C: Yeah, Doe Finance. So it came out earlier this year, unfortunately. Got exploited. They got exploited to the tune of like 2 to 3 million dollars.
00:13:34.035 - 00:13:35.675, Speaker A: Was that like all of it or.
00:13:35.715 - 00:13:37.055, Speaker C: Yeah, it was all the cvl.
00:13:37.355 - 00:13:41.499, Speaker A: It was a small application and it did get hacked basically. Or exploited.
00:13:41.587 - 00:13:54.369, Speaker C: Yeah, it got exploited. It was nascent and it only ever had like one governance proposal. It was, you know, the typical meme of one wallet with 99% of the vote passing it. Yeah. So it was a very decentralized, nascent.
00:13:54.417 - 00:13:57.681, Speaker A: And not, well, not big in the scheme of things, but it was.
00:13:57.713 - 00:14:13.033, Speaker C: I mean, it's a useful functionality and other protocols have done similar things. You know, Urine has been kind of similar to that. Hyper Cadabra has done like Stegen Box similar kind of strategies. It's got utility, but it's got utility as long as you don't lose all your capital in it.
00:14:13.129 - 00:14:23.759, Speaker A: So these guys that are. And I guess some of this comes from the coindesks. The coindesk did some reporting on this world Liberty Financial. It's being built, we think by this DOE Finance team.
00:14:23.807 - 00:14:35.383, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So all the, all the info we have is CoinDesk supposedly has their hands on the white paper and got access to their public GitHub. They delisted it after it was public for a little bit.
00:14:35.439 - 00:14:35.927, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:36.031 - 00:14:56.751, Speaker C: But yeah, all the info is from CoinDesk reporting on it. We haven't been able to get our hands on the white paper just yet. But yeah, it's the two main founders there, Zach and Chase. Yeah, they were like serial or serial, what do you call it? Entrepreneur investors. Yeah, sorry, entrepreneur influencers.
00:14:56.823 - 00:14:57.175, Speaker A: I see.
00:14:57.215 - 00:14:57.551, Speaker C: Yes.
00:14:57.623 - 00:14:59.023, Speaker A: Like what? Making videos and stuff.
00:14:59.079 - 00:15:02.623, Speaker C: Making videos. Selling. Selling access to like master groups type thing.
00:15:02.679 - 00:15:03.207, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:15:03.311 - 00:15:05.575, Speaker C: Very. You know, Andrew Tate, like so and.
00:15:05.615 - 00:15:12.759, Speaker A: So the GitHub that CoinDesk looked at, which they took down, now it was DOE finance code, basically it was a.
00:15:12.767 - 00:15:13.815, Speaker C: Fork of the DOE Finance code.
00:15:13.855 - 00:15:28.313, Speaker A: Okay. So the idea is that when this thing launches, it'll be this wrapper on a lending protocol is AAVE that it connects with. Right. So then what users can go and deposit stables or ETH or whatever, presumably and earn yield on them. That's the idea.
00:15:28.369 - 00:15:29.041, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the idea.
00:15:29.113 - 00:15:36.417, Speaker A: That's this world changing idea that they've. Why does it have utility? I mean, you said this is it. I mean you can just do this on AAVE now.
00:15:36.441 - 00:15:37.793, Speaker C: You can do it yourself. You can do it yourself.
00:15:37.849 - 00:15:40.005, Speaker A: I mean, it's just, it's automating this for you.
00:15:40.385 - 00:16:10.257, Speaker C: It's automating a manual process. It helps you manage a bit of the, like some of the risks involved in this stuff when you're looping leverage like this is that, you know, price deviations, small price deviations can get you liquidated. So it helps you manage some of those things and just generally takes a little bit of the manual workload off of you. I mean it's useful, it's a useful product. And especially in like Defi where lending rates and borrowing rates are pretty low, getting a little bit extra juice there is pretty important to make it competitive versus like traditional yield opportunities, money market fund.
00:16:10.321 - 00:16:18.717, Speaker A: What is this Trump situation? So the team is building it. It's not, you know, as far as we know, like Don Jr. Or Eric didn't like take up solidity coding, right?
00:16:18.781 - 00:16:36.901, Speaker C: No, no, I don't, I don't think they're. They're big smart contract devs right now. No, it's just a lot of endorsements. So Trump is the. Donald Trump is like the main kind of crypto visionary for the group. Don and Eric are web3 ambassadors. Baron is, I believe called Defi visionary.
00:16:36.973 - 00:16:53.407, Speaker A: Yeah. So these are in that white paper. Supposedly they're named. And then the other validation we have is that Trump, Donald Trump, the former president, he tweeted it. He tweeted their Twitter handle like World Liberty Fire or something like that. Yeah, that's pretty much.
00:16:53.511 - 00:16:54.423, Speaker C: It's been promoting it.
00:16:54.479 - 00:16:55.903, Speaker A: And that's basically what we've got though, right.
00:16:55.959 - 00:16:58.271, Speaker C: Defi protocol promoted by former president.
00:16:58.343 - 00:17:03.887, Speaker A: And there's a telegram channel that we follow that is the project's channel.
00:17:04.031 - 00:17:04.519, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:04.607 - 00:17:08.521, Speaker A: They've been announcing some advisors, right?
00:17:08.553 - 00:17:08.881, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:08.953 - 00:17:11.337, Speaker A: Some lawyer. They announced there's somebody else.
00:17:11.521 - 00:17:13.273, Speaker C: I was not familiar with any of the lawyers.
00:17:13.329 - 00:17:13.737, Speaker A: Me neither.
00:17:13.801 - 00:17:14.649, Speaker C: Typical kind of folks.
00:17:14.697 - 00:17:18.441, Speaker A: None of them. None of them like super confidence inspiring, I would say.
00:17:18.473 - 00:17:23.953, Speaker C: Yeah. And the smart contract devs and stuff, they're the guys from. From DOE Finance. There's not really like a big history around them.
00:17:24.089 - 00:17:43.745, Speaker A: And like unfortunately. Right. Like the history we do know is that their last one did get exploited. Right. The project has been saying in their telegram that they are. That security is paramount, that they've engaged like Tokyo and Certik and others which are like smart contract, cybersecurity evaluation, whatever we call them. Right.
00:17:43.745 - 00:17:54.177, Speaker A: I mean almost pretty much every. Most of the major apps that have suffered exploits were also vetted by these. I mean, you know, that's why, you know, that's good you somebody review the code.
00:17:54.201 - 00:18:05.293, Speaker C: But I always tell you the smart contract audits are like, they're like credit ratings from rating agencies pre 2008. They're not worth that much and they're mostly incentivized to take a check for it.
00:18:05.389 - 00:18:09.037, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's even if they do a good job to be clear like you can still get hacked.
00:18:09.061 - 00:18:09.285, Speaker C: I mean.
00:18:09.325 - 00:18:18.973, Speaker A: Right. That's why hackers are good at hacking. Right. They don't. So. Okay, so do we know anything else about it? When's it going to launch? Do we have any idea?
00:18:19.149 - 00:18:36.235, Speaker C: We don't have any idea when it's going to launch. We do have a few other details. Some folks in crypto lawyers put in their ethics disclaimers some details about the tokens they got. So I believe is Gabe Shapiro, his law firm.
00:18:36.315 - 00:18:40.003, Speaker A: His law firm say that I think it's. It's actually a partner of his in the firm. But. Yes, yes.
00:18:40.019 - 00:18:42.915, Speaker C: So they got an allocation. So we got some details about the tokenomics.
00:18:42.955 - 00:18:44.067, Speaker A: So there will be a token.
00:18:44.171 - 00:18:57.177, Speaker C: Yes, but it is of the new kind of meta of a non transferable token that will be like logged to an account and then it'll be transferable based on a governance vote at some point.
00:18:57.241 - 00:18:58.817, Speaker A: Governance vote will.
00:18:58.961 - 00:19:03.993, Speaker C: So it's the Eigen layer model. It's kind of similar to an airline points thing. It's little.
00:19:04.049 - 00:19:11.065, Speaker A: Until it's not safer. Yes, until it's not. So. Well it's sort of like you cross that bridge when you choose to. It's not. So there will be a token though.
00:19:11.105 - 00:19:19.985, Speaker C: Yeah, there's going to be a token. And this is part of the again from the CoinDesk reporting that the Trumps say they don't own any of World Liberty Financial but they do.
00:19:20.065 - 00:19:22.385, Speaker A: They may own to the token some tokens.
00:19:22.425 - 00:19:22.721, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:22.793 - 00:19:26.797, Speaker A: Do we know anything about the economic design of this token like the supply or the.
00:19:26.961 - 00:19:33.525, Speaker C: Just that there's a pretty big insider allocation. It's reported about 70% insider allocation which is about as high as it gets.
00:19:33.605 - 00:19:36.821, Speaker A: So like to the do finance team and.
00:19:36.853 - 00:19:38.653, Speaker C: Or team early Trump's.
00:19:38.789 - 00:19:44.509, Speaker A: It's unclear. Trump's team 70% in Bitcoin terminology. 70% pre mine is what.
00:19:44.557 - 00:19:44.789, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:44.837 - 00:19:46.685, Speaker A: Is effectively what we're saying. Yeah.
00:19:46.765 - 00:19:47.581, Speaker C: Very decentralized.
00:19:47.653 - 00:19:49.545, Speaker A: Not good. That's really not great.
00:19:50.845 - 00:19:51.301, Speaker C: All right.
00:19:51.333 - 00:19:52.145, Speaker A: I mean I.
00:19:52.645 - 00:19:59.413, Speaker C: Not much. I mean we'll see when it launches. You know this is all kind of off of some reporting, some older code. So they may have come up some.
00:19:59.429 - 00:20:11.021, Speaker A: Things and they did kind of freak out when the reporting happened. They pulled their GitHub, the Doe Finance app is still alive. Right. Like smart contracts can't actually the smart contract is live and the front end they password protected.
00:20:11.173 - 00:20:11.485, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:11.525 - 00:20:14.805, Speaker A: So they kind of tried to wipe like a bunch of their stuff. Right.
00:20:14.885 - 00:20:21.425, Speaker C: Yeah. As we were doing the research kind of the day of the launch we refreshed the web page and it was like username password protected.
00:20:21.585 - 00:20:36.841, Speaker A: So yeah, that's also not super confidence inspiring, but I guess it's certainly a milestone. A former president has some involvement in a DEFI application. I mean that's a step further for Trump.
00:20:36.953 - 00:20:48.177, Speaker C: Mixed bag, maybe not the best blue chip protocol, but I'll take it versus the beating we've been getting from the SEC and the current look.
00:20:48.201 - 00:21:10.405, Speaker A: I mean, being interested in DEFI is reasonable, I think. And they've been marketing this sort of along the lines it feels like as sort of. I mean it's called World Liberty Financial. To me, it feels like an attempt to try to build something that is in the vein of a solution to like the Canadian truckers situation when the Canadian government like blocked and froze all their funds and stuff. Right.
00:21:11.265 - 00:21:15.953, Speaker C: And it's also in the US's benefit here to make sure that US stays dominant globally.
00:21:16.049 - 00:21:31.429, Speaker A: This is what they also said, I think in their channel. They said that like a core part of this is promoting the dollar, which is also quite of an interesting. It's going to be interesting. And we don't know when it launches. There's no like way to know that or anything like that.
00:21:31.437 - 00:21:37.181, Speaker C: No, there's no timeline, there's no, there's no project docs. It's pretty light on details.
00:21:37.253 - 00:21:42.069, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll be following it. Thad, thank you for the rundown. Thanks for coming on Galaxy Brains.
