The story that I tell all the time is I had a staffer who was into crypto and was managing my financial services portfolio, and he gave me a book, like, the first year I was here, the age of cryptocurrency, and I read the book, and it was like, you know what? This is everything I believe in. I mean, when I was growing up in the seventies and the eighties, it's like, this is where the era of big government was becoming bigger and bigger. This is where you develop the we want to go back to the gold standard group versus the Keynesians, who believe the government has to take all these resources and generate the economy. I tend to fall on the individual side of that argument.
