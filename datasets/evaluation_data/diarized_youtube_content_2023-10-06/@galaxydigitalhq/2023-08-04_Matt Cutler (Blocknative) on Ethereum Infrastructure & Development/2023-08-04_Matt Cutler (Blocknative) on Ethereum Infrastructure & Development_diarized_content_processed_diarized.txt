00:01:01.006 - 00:01:21.256, Speaker A: Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brainstorm. We have a great show for you today. Matt Cutler, CEO of Block Native, a fascinating Ethereum infrastructure company. He is our guest. We'll get into it with him on mev block building and the future of Ethereum development. Christine Kim from Galaxy Research will join us for that interview. And of course, we'll check with our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets.
00:01:21.256 - 00:01:40.830, Speaker A: But before we get to all that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Really looking forward to this one. So let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend Bimnet, welcome to the show.
00:01:40.982 - 00:01:41.998, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:42.086 - 00:01:43.394, Speaker A: What's going on this week?
00:01:44.374 - 00:02:06.946, Speaker B: Well, you know, I think the most important thing to happen this week is the breakdown that you've had in long and US fixed income that's been driven by a combination of really robust data out of the US in addition to additional supply above and beyond what the market had expected being announced by the treasury.
00:02:07.010 - 00:02:15.174, Speaker A: So this is them selling new issuance of bonds to refill their coffers after the debt ceiling stuff.
00:02:16.314 - 00:02:55.724, Speaker B: This is regular course of business. The debt ceiling is a weird thing, but every quarter of the treasury tells you how much of each particular issue they're going to issue. So they'll be like, oh, this month we're going to sell $40 billion of tens. Next month we'll sell 45. And so the treasury produced those figures today, and they were a little bit higher than expected in the US, particularly for the longer duration profile securities. And we were coming off of really strong data like ADP today printed like around 340,000 jobs gained month on month. First expectations of like 192.
00:02:55.724 - 00:03:42.350, Speaker B: You had PCE data come out late last week that showed that we're still in inflation. There wasn't anything that tells you that, oh, we can cool down and durable good orders were really strong. And then you've got the employment data that's coming out that this Friday. And you also, there was one bit of data that was a little contrary to this price action. It's known as the senior loan officer survey slews. It's basically a survey that's used to gauge credit conditions. So it asks a bunch of bank lending managers and folks that are in charge of that process what's going on with credit.
00:03:42.350 - 00:03:54.514, Speaker B: Basically, they're like credit's contracting. And that was one of the things that Powell highlighted in his speech is that, you know, we are seeing a pass through of high interest rates into credit market, which they want.
00:03:54.554 - 00:03:56.594, Speaker A: Right. That tightening, that's monetary tightness.
00:03:56.634 - 00:04:21.300, Speaker B: That's how you transmit monetary policy into the real economy. Right. And so you are seeing that tightening now, like with stocks still close to the dead highs and historically tight labor market, though, like, just because you are seeing credit contraction, the question is, will that translate into a decline in core inflation? And right now it's. Yet it's still tough to say.
00:04:21.332 - 00:04:24.500, Speaker A: I just saw a headline that was like, Americans are just still happily spending.
00:04:24.532 - 00:04:47.616, Speaker B: A lot of money, tons of money. Absolutely. And it's like one the social transfers that happened during COVID they're still expansive. But the big part is, and it's a new point that I just came across from a hedge fund newsletter, but it's really hard for companies to fire people when their stock is at all time highs or close to it all.
00:04:47.640 - 00:04:48.296, Speaker A: It's hard to say.
00:04:48.320 - 00:05:08.958, Speaker B: We have to tighten the belt. Yeah, we have to tighten the belt. Wait, you're tightening the belt and stocks up 40% on the year. How does that translate? I really think the crux of the inflation issue comes down to the tightness in the US labor market. And that tightness isn't, I don't know how that's gonna change. We're getting tighter and tighter.
00:05:09.006 - 00:05:09.634, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:10.054 - 00:05:16.790, Speaker B: And job, we had job opening data this week. We still have 9.6 million job openings in the US.
00:05:16.862 - 00:05:17.542, Speaker A: And how many people?
00:05:17.598 - 00:05:26.358, Speaker B: That is roughly. There are 1.7 jobs per person looking. Wow. Wow. Right.
00:05:26.406 - 00:05:28.886, Speaker A: So the pricing power is still in the hands of the employees at this point.
00:05:28.990 - 00:05:49.216, Speaker B: And so that's why you have to pay real close attention to average hourly earnings. Right. And then unit labor costs. And last week we had the employment cost index that I believe was in line around 4%. But wages are keeping up is the point. And then the other part is just home. Home prices are fine.
00:05:49.216 - 00:05:53.824, Speaker B: Cause there's no supply of housing otherwise. There's no supply of houses. Everybody has less than 3% mortgage.
00:05:53.864 - 00:05:54.496, Speaker A: They're locked in.
00:05:54.560 - 00:05:58.168, Speaker B: So, like, it's just becoming, like, so tough.
00:05:58.216 - 00:06:00.072, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like cementing. Right?
00:06:00.168 - 00:06:00.632, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:06:00.688 - 00:06:05.112, Speaker A: And so at least it's not too bad. What it's cementing at right now. It's not where they want it.
00:06:05.248 - 00:06:06.936, Speaker B: Yeah, it's getting better. But what do we have?
00:06:06.960 - 00:06:09.048, Speaker A: Year over year? CPI in June was three.
00:06:09.136 - 00:06:10.600, Speaker B: Right, but that's a headline.
00:06:10.672 - 00:06:11.000, Speaker A: Right?
00:06:11.072 - 00:06:12.888, Speaker B: The core, what was that?
00:06:12.936 - 00:06:13.216, Speaker A: Higher?
00:06:13.280 - 00:06:19.480, Speaker B: I think the core is correct. If I'm wrong, like around four, like, low fours.
00:06:19.512 - 00:06:20.224, Speaker A: That's not great.
00:06:20.304 - 00:06:23.368, Speaker B: That's 2% target. You're 200 basis points away.
00:06:23.536 - 00:06:30.242, Speaker A: And one of the student loan forgiveness rolls. So that's a big catalyst. And you expect, like, should that have.
00:06:30.258 - 00:06:51.890, Speaker B: A positive impact on the average student loan payment in the US is around $550 a month. A month, yeah. And so I don't know what portion of that is, like, federal versus private, but there's a lot of money that needs to get paid as a function of these student loans. And that starts in October. So that should be a drag.
00:06:51.962 - 00:06:52.642, Speaker A: Take some out of it.
00:06:52.658 - 00:07:02.242, Speaker B: But at the end of the day, it's like, if people have jobs and they have credit cards and they can't buy homes anymore, what else are they gonna buy? Yeah, what else are they gonna buy?
00:07:02.298 - 00:07:03.018, Speaker A: Stocks.
00:07:03.146 - 00:07:03.554, Speaker B: Stocks.
00:07:03.594 - 00:07:04.274, Speaker A: Consumer goods.
00:07:04.314 - 00:07:16.054, Speaker B: Consumer goods. Electronics. Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, that's what I mean. Durable goods has shown, like, remarkable strength. Like, it's like, I can't buy a home. Like, what am I gonna buy?
00:07:16.434 - 00:07:18.098, Speaker A: Furniture. Literally.
00:07:18.186 - 00:07:18.410, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:18.442 - 00:07:21.258, Speaker A: Buy a new couch. I just bought a new couch. It's great, by the way.
00:07:21.426 - 00:07:22.162, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:07:22.298 - 00:07:24.480, Speaker A: Let's talk about the crypto markets a little bit.
00:07:24.562 - 00:07:25.212, Speaker B: Let's get going.
00:07:25.268 - 00:07:32.732, Speaker A: So there's been. Here's one thing that. That happened earlier this week, right. There was this. This motion to dismiss ruling in the terraform labs.
00:07:32.828 - 00:07:33.356, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:07:33.420 - 00:07:56.672, Speaker A: Yep. SEC litigation. And the market was interested in this because in, in the motion to dismiss, again, just another of the SEC cases, the judge specifically made a point to specifically reject the analysis put forth by the other judge in the ripple ruling two or three weeks ago. And so what was the reaction in markets generally to this?
00:07:56.848 - 00:08:01.964, Speaker B: You know, I would say that it was fairly muted. That's what I thought too.
00:08:02.624 - 00:08:04.088, Speaker A: Seemed like a relatively big story.
00:08:04.176 - 00:08:22.112, Speaker B: A relatively big story ultimately where I thought, you know, you'd see the greatest impact was on ripple because in the original ruling it moved a lot. Right. And so, but you really haven't seen follow through on the ripple side. Cause technically they still did win their case. Well, yeah, it's just the precedent around the security side.
00:08:22.208 - 00:08:25.088, Speaker A: These two cases like don't affect each other directly.
00:08:25.176 - 00:08:25.448, Speaker B: Correct.
00:08:25.496 - 00:08:41.688, Speaker A: But it's more just like, well, we thought we had a positive ruling and question on how we test stuff and now we literally have the exact same federal district court, the southern District of New York, just with a different ruling. That's the opposite of it. So now we're just back to like square one of like no clarity.
00:08:41.816 - 00:08:48.244, Speaker B: No clarity. And fundamentally that should be bad for alts. Right. But you already had the moves.
00:08:48.564 - 00:08:53.324, Speaker A: We're already down from over thirty k and we're already down from 1900 ETH. Yeah.
00:08:53.404 - 00:09:18.464, Speaker B: Yeah. And so that wasn't constructive. And I think your point about judicial precedent and the lack of precedent that that ripple ruling now has is very meaningful. But I'd say the biggest piece of crypto news out there came from Michael Saylor, who recently announced by his company that he's going to be purchasing another $750 million of bitcoin, potentially.
00:09:18.794 - 00:09:26.994, Speaker A: And so this guy is gonna own all the bitcoin. What does he have, 150,000 bitcoin or something? He's one of the biggest.
00:09:27.074 - 00:09:36.882, Speaker B: 200 now. Yeah, definitely one of the biggest stacks. Yeah. He's buying a lot and he's kind.
00:09:36.898 - 00:09:39.714, Speaker A: Of back to like at breakeven or whatever his cost basis.
00:09:39.754 - 00:09:43.334, Speaker B: He, he's right around there. Yeah. It's like around 25.
00:09:44.154 - 00:09:45.452, Speaker A: Wild strategy.
00:09:45.618 - 00:09:57.352, Speaker B: It is. And I respect it and I wish I had courage, maybe a fraction of that size. It takes a lot of courage to do what he's doing.
00:09:57.528 - 00:10:01.124, Speaker A: You don't think markets are reacting on the litecoin having.
00:10:02.064 - 00:10:12.638, Speaker B: Sorry. No, no. I think it's relevant, but just in the big picture, we just had an exploit of curve. Right.
00:10:12.686 - 00:10:13.126, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:13.230 - 00:10:24.694, Speaker B: And the spillover has yet to be fully finalized, but I think the fact that you've seen huge reductions in coin.
00:10:24.734 - 00:10:27.654, Speaker A: Prices, defi prices, defi prices collapsing.
00:10:27.694 - 00:11:02.302, Speaker B: I mean, I think that's notable. That is notable. I think it's notable in the sense of market confidence in Defi and some of these defi tokens. And so I'm still waiting on kind of seeing the follow through from that. I would think that part of the value of ETH, or the value proposition of ETH is a very robust and secure defi system. And that argument definitely took a little bit of a hit this week. I'm not as constructive on the ETH defi complex as I was a week.
00:11:02.318 - 00:11:05.434, Speaker A: Ago at the moment. Yeah, that was a big deal.
00:11:05.894 - 00:11:16.336, Speaker B: That's a big deal. And fundamentally, like, the idea of security and stableness, like, is crucial to products.
00:11:16.400 - 00:11:33.184, Speaker A: That can't be the reason why this stuff isn't working. That's very. That puts a real dent in the armor, right? No, absolutely. Confidence when these types of exploits happen, that's curve two, right. Is the most important stable coin money market, basically, in the world. Yeah.
00:11:33.224 - 00:11:39.210, Speaker B: And I think that money market model is one that we should have dropped in, you know, traditional money markets.
00:11:39.282 - 00:11:40.370, Speaker A: If it doesn't get hacked.
00:11:40.442 - 00:11:50.498, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, like, why couldn't we have a euro yen, like, you know, stable coin pool on there, everybody trading 24/7 really? Like, I would love to.
00:11:50.546 - 00:11:51.794, Speaker A: There's genuine innovation there.
00:11:51.834 - 00:11:56.610, Speaker B: No, there's genuine. Seriously. And, like, yield bearing stables, if that ever came about.
00:11:56.682 - 00:11:57.050, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:57.122 - 00:12:28.584, Speaker B: Like, and you'd put them, like, on chain and trade. Like, there's so much potential there. And so that's why it's a little deflating, to be honest with you. And so I think the trades are pretty easy. I mean, you have a guy that's about to buy $750 million at bitcoin, and you have defi moving around here, moving around here, and it's not looking great. So, personally, I like bitcoin higher and ETH not to go higher.
00:12:29.484 - 00:12:33.970, Speaker A: All right, you heard it here. Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to have you.
00:12:34.092 - 00:12:34.914, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:12:35.734 - 00:12:47.614, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Matt Cutler, co founder and CEO of Block Native. Matt, it's great to have you on here. We've been chatting about trying to get this done for a while, and you just got back from ECC in Paris, so it's a great time to connect. Thanks for coming on, galaxy brains.
00:12:47.774 - 00:12:51.878, Speaker C: You bet. My pleasure. And great to be here and talking with you, Alex and Christine.
00:12:51.966 - 00:12:52.302, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:52.358 - 00:12:55.758, Speaker A: And we have Christine Kim here from galaxy research to join for this conversation.
00:12:55.846 - 00:12:57.262, Speaker D: I'm so excited to chat with you guys.
00:12:57.318 - 00:13:15.774, Speaker A: It's been a while since you've been on the podcast, so I'm great to have you back on. You've been busy. You've been too busy. I've been calling. Your assistant says you're not available. Before we get into some really interesting topics with Matt. Matt, if you could set us up with what is block native and how has it evolved over time as Ethereum is always changing?
00:13:16.354 - 00:13:57.042, Speaker C: Sure. Block Native is a core infrastructure provider for the Ethereum ecosystem. Right now, our infrastructure is about 10% of all of Ethereum blocks get passed through our relay and builders we're known particularly for doing what's known as mempool observability, real time data, making sure that everybody in the ecosystem has adequate access to that. We were founded more than five years ago, and we've been building infrastructure and Ethereum ever since. But it's been quite an interesting journey. We started out as a completely different project, believe it or not, doing NFT games way back in the day. This was like early cryptokie these days, and it was hard to use.
00:13:57.042 - 00:14:28.370, Speaker C: And so we're a bunch of nerds and started to develop tools to make things easier to use and give more feedback about transactions. And what we learned was the NFT game we were building was kind of meh, but these developer tools were pretty cool and people kept asking for that. So we wound up evolving the company into a developer infrastructure entity, changed the name to block native, and it's been quite a journey ever since. And so we feel really lucky to be doing what we're doing in the ways that we are. And it's been, it's never a dull moment in the world of Ethereum, that's for sure.
00:14:28.482 - 00:15:06.134, Speaker A: It isn't. And I think when I first met you, you guys really, like you said, mempool observability, that really was your core. I think it was right when the blog came out about Ethereum being a dark forest public discovery of mev, and then also the March 12, 2020 situation that had happened with the nonce values being off and all these transactions failing. I remember that was something that with your tools, you could help mitigate. People could avoid that disaster on March 12. But now, with proof of stake, you guys are building blocks and relaying blocks. That's a significant change beyond a data analytics company.
00:15:06.594 - 00:16:06.026, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting. We have been pretty ear to the ground and evolving with sort of as the market progresses, we continue to evolve the organization. So about ten months ago or so now, there was the merge with the transition of proof of stake. This introduced this notion known as PBS, or proposer builder separation, sort of formalizing the outsourcing of block construction from block proposal and validation to the network, basically creating a brand new market of specialist actors who build blocks by building a block. It's determining inclusion, exclusion, ordering, literally what transactions get in, and then a whole bunch of necessary underlying infrastructure to relay that to the network and to protect various actors from all sorts of bad outcomes. And we made the determination that our global infrastructure and our expertise was pretty well suited for that class of problem and that there are some pretty interesting economic opportunities that were going to come online as a result. So we, I like to say, evolved into becoming a block builder and relay.
00:16:06.026 - 00:16:28.194, Speaker C: In addition to all the stuff that we've been doing before, we, you know, we also operate probably the number one wallet connection library in the ecosystem called Web three onboard, which is used by many major DApps and Dexs and things like that. We provide the number one gas estimator in Ethereum. And so we've been doing nerd stuff to make Ethereum operate more predictably for a long time now, and we plan to continue to do so.
00:16:28.354 - 00:16:40.374, Speaker A: The nerd stuff isn't ending. You guys just both got back from ECC. I mean, I'd love to hear some of your impressions, Matt, on how that conference was, and maybe, I don't know, did you guys see each other when you were there? Paris is a big city.
00:16:40.554 - 00:16:58.834, Speaker C: We were in the same room a few times. We unfortunately did not get a chance to catch up. So it was pretty hectic as these sorts of events. So ECC is a major ecosystem conference, the Ethereum community conference, it's usually in Paris. Next year is going to be in Brussels. Why? Summer Olympics are going to be in Paris. So they got to move it.
00:16:58.834 - 00:17:23.364, Speaker C: It is the core event, but there were, I think, over 200 side events surrounding it. So it was all over Paris. There was, you know, everyone was there, quote unquote, everybody. And I think it was a very optimistic event. It was a very collaborative series of events. There were some big themes that ran through it. MeV, or maximal extractable value, is a major trend, and that's where Christine and I overlap.
00:17:23.364 - 00:17:49.164, Speaker C: There were many events and parties and conferences and salons focused on various aspects of MeV. I think MeV has gone from being a sort of esoteric and somewhat feared topic to being kind of a mainstream and understood topic. It's become a bit even potential pedestrian even. And then account abstraction, as enabled by ERC 4337 was another major theme that was happening there. I'm sure there were other themes going on, but those are the two that I was paying attention to.
00:17:49.244 - 00:18:32.584, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd have to agree with that. I think those were two of the biggest themes. I mean, Vitalik, in his main stage talk at ECC was entirely about the history of account abstraction. And Mev has just grown to be kind of like one of the biggest buzzwords, I feel like, in Ethereum protocol development. I'd be curious to hear though, Matt, a little bit more about some of the themes and narratives that came out of those two topics, like around MeV. What were some of the themes that caught you by surprise that you thought were new developments since the last time that we spoke about MEV and also around the topic of account abstraction, did you think that there was some meaningful coordination and development there that hadn't existed before ECC?
00:18:34.444 - 00:19:29.964, Speaker C: Two big questions. So on the topic of MEV, probably the biggest development, that sort of news that came out of ECC was Uniswap X, which uniswap as a protocol, I think accounts for over 80% of the mev value on Ethereum. And so I have had this thesis for some time that the sleeping giants will awaken, that the existing sort of MEV ecosystem sort of supposes that wallets are going to be blind to it, they're just going to toss their transactions in the public mempool and hope for the best, and that the protocols are going to kind of not really worry about it. It's not their problem. And I felt that that was a pretty bad series, assumptions. And so I think it's very clear. So this has been a trend that's been going on for a while, but I think is quite stark at ECC was most everybody is paying attention and they're doing things to help manage and mitigate and route MeV.
00:19:29.964 - 00:20:16.516, Speaker C: And so it's gone from something that was sort of as dark forest and scary to something that's one of the engineering requirements for the next iteration. I think we have more Mev aware infrastructure. That's what we do at block native that people that protocols and projects can tap into. And one of the things that we thought was going to be a big trend was this notion of MEV recirculation. So ultimately value is a consequence of user transactions, as in, without a user doing a transaction, there's no MEV. And that there would be this natural move towards recirculating significant percentage of that value back there is a new protocol or infrastructure called MeV Blocker, which is led by the Cowswap team, which has seen some pretty rapid adoption. But if you look at the metrics there, they're not recirculating, getting very much value at all.
00:20:16.516 - 00:20:35.348, Speaker C: Like, it's just not a lot economically, but they are protecting a lot of transactions. So I think the theme right now is private transactions are growing. We have block native have published data that says steady state Ethereum. About two to 3% of all transactions were private, and that has rapidly jumped to almost 15% of the network.
00:20:35.436 - 00:20:35.772, Speaker D: Wow.
00:20:35.828 - 00:21:09.504, Speaker C: And at least that one of the major events at MeV Day. The audience surveyed suggests that everyone expected that to grow to maybe 25% to 50% or even more. So I think private transactions and private memory are a very clear trend, and that will continue to grow and are probably constructive for users and protocols alike. Of course, they have problems and consequences of when as well, particularly on observability. So we think that the stuff that we specialize in gets more complicated and more important. So we're excited about that. I think the other thing too is Meb used to be kind of scary, and it feels a whole lot less scary today.
00:21:09.504 - 00:21:39.316, Speaker C: It's become more professionalized. There's a smaller number of larger actors who exhibit, exhibit greater control. And I think it has always been perceived as somewhat of an existential threat to the decentralization of ethereum, and it unquestionably remains that. And there are certain aspects of the infrastructure that we think are still pretty fragile in this regard. And we are at block native, are trying to work with our peers to make them less so. But there's still a long way to go, and that's why this remains an area of very active research for the Ethereum foundation. That's.
00:21:39.316 - 00:21:55.624, Speaker C: Those are my top level observations about. And by the way, like Meb used to be this tiny little thing in the corner, or this one event that people would go to. There was a major mev event every single day of the week at ECC, and there was a circuit of that. So it was pretty interesting that way. That's my thoughts there anything you would add to that, Christine?
00:21:56.204 - 00:22:12.100, Speaker D: I would just highlight again that the MEV days were the most popular events at ECC. I think they were the hardest ones to get into, with lines to get into them, kind of like wrapping around the block. So I was pretty surprised at that, given the.
00:22:12.172 - 00:22:53.194, Speaker A: Is this one of those things? Like there was a meme that was like there was some kid who was the national canadian chess champion for seven years in a row. And they were like, where are we as a society putting this kid to work? Please? Is he going to be an astronaut? Is he building rockets? Is he going to solve world hunger? No, he's a quant at a hedge fund on Wall street. We're like, great. Is that what's happening in Mev? Is this the forefront? The smartest people right now are deep in the MV MeV world. It's the most exciting, most interesting, same thing. Is it drawing in? Is that why it was so busy? And you can see I'm passing a little bit of judgment because it's like, oh, what a great use of our most brilliant minds. But anyway, is that to Mev?
00:22:53.274 - 00:23:46.130, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think Mev, the more people started to understand it, recognized that MeV as a concept. It just is so difficult to define. And it touches, like, all aspects of Ethereum's protocol, not just the core protocol layer, but mempools, decentralized exchanges, centralized exchanges, decentralized that relationship. So it's hard to find a topic around Ethereum where MeV is not involved. So account abstraction, I think, is another great example of where MeV plays a big role, because some of the leading solutions for account abstraction involve the use of an alternative mempool and Mev. But I'd love to ask you also, Matt, a little bit more about the problems that you foresee around the fragmentation of the mempool as we start to see a growing number of private transactions being made on Ethereum.
00:23:46.130 - 00:24:07.358, Speaker D: The growth of alternative mempools around account abstraction, and how does that decrease the transparency of the Ethereum blockchain and make it far more difficult for any one company, really, to be able to give an accurate view of what's happening on the network and track, say, censoring behavior on the network.
00:24:07.546 - 00:24:33.274, Speaker C: Wow, that's a great question. And so I'm going to answer this in three parts. First off, MeV is an intrinsic property of ordered transaction systems, period. It's not specific to Ethereum or anything else. So, by the way, all transaction systems are ordered because it doesn't make any sense. Without ordering, you can't understand what settles and what doesn't. So airline tickets, Mev concerts, mev SEO, mev.
00:24:33.274 - 00:25:07.394, Speaker C: The difference in Ethereum is that it's more open and programmable, that historically MeV has been controlled by a single centralized actor who then captures all of it for themselves. And Ethereum, it's not that way. So it gets a lot more attention here, but it's everywhere. Two is there are two sides to these public blockchain networks. One is an ephemeral data side, which are generally known as mempools. There are aspects of Ethereum which are not technically called mempools, but they act that way. These are places where transactions go to be candidates for inclusion.
00:25:07.394 - 00:26:12.016, Speaker C: So this is pre consensus or pre chain. And today on Ethereum, there's really one major mempool, the public mempool, the transaction pool. It's where when you sign a transaction, hit submit, and then you wait 15 plus seconds. What you're waiting is where your transaction is pending in the mempool to be included in the next block. There are private mem pools. Today, in fact, there's a growing proliferation of private mempools, and these are basically mechanisms to communicate with block builders, to include your transaction without everybody else on the peer to peer layer being able to see it. Now, this construct of mempools is proven to be very popular and very effective as we look out to the Ethereum roadmap, meaning it's a pretty great mechanism to have untrusted actors submit candidates in for someone else to consider without creating denial of service attacks, without creating all sorts of negative external externalities that are typically associated with these sorts of relationships, or you need some sort of buffer in between.
00:26:12.016 - 00:26:55.324, Speaker C: So we have ERC 4337, account abstraction. Basically, what happens here are users express intent to transact using what's known as a user op. Where does that user op go to this new idea called an alt mempool. Now, you go from one mempool to two mempools, the public mempool and the alt mempool. But actually, the alt mempool is a misnomer because there can be an arbitrary number of alt mempools. The alt mempool are monitored and picked up by what are known as bundlers, and it's possible that each bundler will operate their own alt mempool. So now you have alt mempool fragmentation, where, depending on which wallet you use and depending on which bundlers are supported with it, you may or may not get good propagation at the peer to peer layer.
00:26:55.324 - 00:27:29.584, Speaker C: As we look ahead to major network upgrades like 4844 or proto dank sharding, there's contemplation of new mem pools associated with gas prices. As we look down the road at EPBS, which is the next generation, it's enshrined PBS. There's this notion of a bid pool where builders will make bids directly in, rather than going through the relay network, which they do right now, and on and on and on. And so the good news is mempools work. Mempools are proven. Mempools scale. Mempools have great decentralization properties, but they're not a panacea one, for instance.
00:27:29.584 - 00:28:01.552, Speaker C: They lack observability. It's ephemeral. You don't know what happens. And this matters because on chain data tells you what happened, but Mempool data tells you why it happened. And of course, Mev is determined in the mempool and then gets expressed on chain. And so if you really want to understand why things are settling the way that they are, why outcomes are happening, why transactions get included and don't get included, why they revert that, you really need understanding of mempool data. And so observability is a big challenge.
00:28:01.552 - 00:28:46.284, Speaker C: And then as you add more mempools with more fragmentation, you just sort of geometrically make that more difficult, which we think is pretty interesting as a business opportunity, as block natives specializing in mempool observability. And we have a number of major new capabilities that we'll be bringing online, both to encourage more research into mempool observability related issues and to just make it easier for everyday users to access and understand and have visibility. Because today for your average user, it's pretty hard to know what's going on in the mempool, and therefore you have some actors who are sophisticated, who have better information than those who are using the network every single day. And that's basically an information asymmetry, which again, isn't great for the credible neutrality of the network.
00:28:46.824 - 00:29:29.444, Speaker D: Yeah, I think credible neutrality and all this talk around how to increase the censorship resistance of Ethereum is starting to become a much larger topic at ECC. One of the main takeaways that I had was around Ethereum's governance and how protocol governance kind of continues to be a contentious topic in the Ethereum community. Curious to know if you can share a little bit more about some of those future capabilities and products that will help improve the visibility of an increasingly fragmented mempool. And yeah, hopefully give people a solution for what could start to become a dark forest again.
00:29:31.384 - 00:30:13.034, Speaker C: Unfortunately, I can't announce anything here, but I can say today we operate the ecosystems only Mempool Explorer. You can get that off our website Explorer dot blocknative.com, but it's kind of a nerd tool, like you put in an address or a smart contract wallet or smart contract or transaction hash, and we will share back with you future facing transaction state changes. So when you do a transaction you can actually set up, it can be entirely automated, it's pretty cool. And you can get push notifications into your favorite messaging app around a new transaction has been detected that involves your wallet address. Its status has changed, it's been confirmed, for instance, but it gives you structured jSon. It's not really for regular people, and it's only for future facing changes.
00:30:13.034 - 00:31:21.928, Speaker C: It doesn't tell you currently what's in the mempool, and it doesn't tell you historic information, as you might imagine. I think one of the areas that we're excited about is to basically take these nerd tool advanced capabilities and make them much more accessible for everyday users and much easier to to leverage and do more useful things with. And we're working with a variety of external parties to sort of fund that effort as sort of some public goods. And again, we'll have announcements to make between now and the end of the year where we'll be pushing some of this stuff out. Alex mentioned Black Thursday. So in March 2020, there was a major exploit of the Makerdao CDP protocol, and we were deeply involved in that investigation and really were the only entity that showed up with historical mempool data because we have global infrastructure, quite a massive set of global infrastructure that not only detects all transaction state changes in the mempool, but archives it. And we have a massive data set that goes back to November 2019 that we continue to build every second of every day.
00:31:21.928 - 00:31:56.272, Speaker C: That has been very helpful for diagnosing various attacks and exploits or weird phenomena. But we have a pretty small data science team, and so we actually have a limited capability of extracting value, that Mempool data archive. So we are very interested to allow a lot of the community to go hands on with that data set and to drive necessary research into topics like epbs, for instance. So that's another initiative that we're working on, is making sure that the research community has access to data that they need to both understand past phenomena and make better design decisions moving forward.
00:31:56.408 - 00:32:55.784, Speaker D: That's really cool to hear. Thank you for sharing more color on that, because I think that really is something that is needed in the Ethereum ecosystem right now. And I'd love to kind of switch gears and talk a little bit more about the economic opportunities that block native has already kind of made with running its own relay and builder. So I know that we've had past discussions around how big that economic opportunity really is. I'm curious to know if any discussions at ecclesiastes made you change your mind around whether or not those economic opportunities for running a relay, running a builder, will continue to shrink in the future. Or if you think that there's some opportunities around relay designs with collateralizing some ETH from searchers, that will potentially increase the pie in terms of running these relays and builders and having that be a long term sustainable business.
00:32:56.494 - 00:33:19.114, Speaker C: Okay, so two separate topics there. So on stage at MeV Day, I made somewhat of a controversial statement, which is, there's this complex MeV supply chain slash value network with all these different actors, but they can, you can effectively boil everybody down into one of three categories. There are validators who make money, there are trader like entities that make money, and there are suckers.
00:33:20.374 - 00:33:21.990, Speaker D: That's one way to put it.
00:33:22.102 - 00:34:15.084, Speaker C: The reason why I say that is that basically, so far, that the economics have devolved into trader like entities, searchers, traders, sextext, arbitrage, stuff like that, and validators. And basically nowhere else in the value chain is there much appreciable economics. And this is problematic, deeply problematic, because there are actors in the value chain who are in the supply chain, who are necessary for the orderly operation of the chain. Probably the one that I care most about is the relay network. So today, 95% of all Ethereum blocks are outsourced using the PBS. Now, today, under the merge, the PBS network is actually a sidecar called Mevboost, which was designed and implemented by a project called Flashbots. And it's entirely outside of the protocol.
00:34:15.084 - 00:34:49.790, Speaker C: And every single one of those blocks that gets included, 95% has to go through a relay. And what relays basically do is protect validators from rogue builders, and protect builders from validators stealing the work that they're doing. So they play a really important and necessary role in the orderly operation. But there are no economics for relays. Relays are totally free. There's no charge at all. Today, there are maybe six or seven independent relay operators that account for 98% of the network.
00:34:49.790 - 00:35:28.018, Speaker C: And so it's pretty centralized and with no explicit economics associated. By the way, it's a very hard job. This is big infrastructure, it's expensive infrastructure, and there is a whole bunch of risk associated with operating a relay. Meaning if you miss a slot, the validators expect to be refunded, and there's regulatory risk, and it's just hard to do. And it's 24/7 it's stressful, and there's literally no reward. So why would any long term entity enter into a hard technical problem which is necessary for the operation of the network that has zero economic upside and a whole bunch of economic risk. I ask myself this every day because we at block native are participating in the supply chain.
00:35:28.018 - 00:36:17.178, Speaker C: We're neither a validator nor a trader. We in many ways and quite objectively are financing the operation of Ethereum itself. We are trying to work with the various members of the ecosystem to say this is not sustainable and creates negative incentives. And that really what we want to do is we want to increase participation in the relay network, we want to increase relay diversity, and to do so we need to introduce relay economics. This has proven to be, at least to me, a shockingly controversial topic for various reasons. And I think the thing is, while the current Mav boost ecosystem isn't perfect by any means, it is working. In fact, it's wildly fulfilled its design objectives of preventing irreversible validator centralization.
00:36:17.178 - 00:36:57.914, Speaker C: It's hard to argue with that. But at current course and speed, privately funded entities like us aren't going to be able to do this ad infinitum. And there's a huge opportunity cost. We could take the engineers and expense that we're doing on relay operation and devote it to other things that may have revenue opportunities. This is a broader issue and trend with Ethereum, and by the way, probably across the board, which is if there's not great economics for anyone other than traders, then the network becomes fundamentally a trading network. Maybe that's inevitable, maybe that there's just no way to avoid traders trading and that's the highest margin activity. So all of these systems will eventually devolve into just trading systems.
00:36:57.914 - 00:37:50.116, Speaker C: But I worry about users being an afterthought and LP's being an afterthought, infrastructure operators being an afterthought. I don't think it's great for Ethereum. I think Ethereum will be a better and more diverse ecosystem with good infrastructure economics. Now of course I'm an infrastructure operator, so it's easy for me to argue that I'm definitely biased in all of this. But it does strike me as this is a major centralization vector that we're going to need to address, and we're trying to work with everybody across the ecosystem, including the Ethereum foundation itself, to address that. Now building is a different topic, so building are the actors who build the blocks and then compete to be the most valuable block. And builders do have potential for positive economics because you can build a block of a certain value, but then you can bid less than that value.
00:37:50.116 - 00:38:27.594, Speaker C: And so as a builder, you then capture the spread. Okay, now, block native is a builder relay. So we are not a trader, but we operate builders and we operate a relay. And. And we went into MeV Boost and the merge thinking that there would be really interesting economics for credibly neutral builders. And so far that thesis has not played out in the slightest that basically the builders that really dominate are searcher builders. So vertical integration between trader like entities and builders, and a lot of that has to do specifically with what's known as sextext arbitrage.
00:38:27.594 - 00:39:37.944, Speaker C: So arbitraging between the price of assets on various centralized exchanges that can move very quickly versus decentralized exchanges that can update every 12 seconds. And it's interesting, the guys over at Special Mechanisms group, Max Resnick and his team, recently published some research that said, when volatility of certain asset pairs on binance goes up, specific builders win 75% of the blocks. And so I made this point at MeV Day, which is, if we look at the broad data on builders, there's a lot of builders that get shared, but it may not be quite as diverse as we think, because in any given moment, there are external factors which may determine which is the one builder which is likely to be dominant under those circumstances. So regardless of what you're doing at any one given moment, you may only have a single builder that you are forced to work with. And that, of course, is centralizing, because depending on the policies of that builder, depending on that builder likes you or not, you may or may not get favorable inclusion. And so again, these are factors that we think need more research, and we want to increase economic incentives to ensure participation in diversity.
00:39:38.884 - 00:40:19.476, Speaker A: This has been fascinating because the amount of development, when you talk about. And that's why I asked that first question, Matt, about the evolution of Ethereum and how it's affected block native. I mean, you guys are riding this wave, right? It's affected you dramatically, and you've been a part of it throughout. So many changes. So much is done. I harass Christine sometimes with this question about doesn't every new change introduce new problems? And Christine gave a really interesting answer, which is definitely yes, the merge introduced a slew of new issues to solve, but that in her opinion, the magnitude of the problems is decreasing over time. Right.
00:40:19.476 - 00:40:31.780, Speaker A: So that they're sort of. And I don't know if that's true. I'd love your quick take on if that's true. Before we wrap, I have a couple closing questions. I'd like to ask you too, Matt. But is that right? Because you introduce proof of stake. Now you've got this whole problem with the validator networks.
00:40:31.780 - 00:40:49.926, Speaker A: Like, then you got to, like, you want, okay, you want to decentralize the proposal block builders. Now you get talking about the, how do you pay for the relayers? Like every sort of. But is in your mind, is ethereum development, like, still moving in a direction that is like, net improving over time despite these new problems that keep popping up?
00:40:50.110 - 00:41:35.926, Speaker C: So, I mean, Ethereum is fundamentally a bet on technological progressivism. And so as technology evolves, it solves one set of issues, and potentially new issues get raised. And I think we can see that across all technologies, this is by no means unique to Ethereum as a technological movement or phenomena. I think in general, I frame this as decentralization is a journey, not a destination. And so it's just continual process of, hey, we're eliminating these risks and these problems, and then there's, you know, new, you know, you push on the balloon in one spot and it pops up in another, and we're sort of iterating through all of that as we go on a journey of increased scalability, stability, participation, network throughput, etcetera. And so I don't know if the problems are getting bigger or smaller or staying the same. It's kind of an interesting way to frame it.
00:41:35.926 - 00:42:05.186, Speaker C: They're certainly changing. And I think the one thing that the Ethereum ecosystem has proved pretty definitively is it can ship software, which, by the way, it's hard to do. And so if Ethereum were to freeze in time, at this moment, it probably doesn't end well. But if Ethereum continues to make the upgrades that are on its roadmap and in a reasonably organized fashion, I think we'll be in pretty good shape. But again, it's hard to foresee the point where we go, yep, we've solved it. It's done.
00:42:05.290 - 00:42:18.884, Speaker A: I've talked about, I've joked about this, that Vitalik comes out, he waves the flag, congrats, everyone. We did it, right? You don't foresee that happening, what we call, particularly in bitcoin protocol ossification. You don't think that ever, does that ever happen?
00:42:20.424 - 00:43:00.028, Speaker C: I always say the difference maybe in five years, which in ethereum time is equivalent to forever. If we think about where we were five years ago versus where we're going to be five years from now, there's, without any question five years of upgrades planned. Certainly ossification seems unlikely in the next five years, at least sort of end to end ostefication, maybe certain layers get sort of settled out. But it's always interesting to play the game of two years ago. What did we think? How did it play out? Right? And by the way, you can do this across ecosystems, as you say, everybody groupthink was x, right? And you go, actually, groupthink was pretty wildly wrong. Like, it's not how it played out at all. So here we are today, looking forward and saying, here's what's going to happen.
00:43:00.028 - 00:43:37.236, Speaker C: And the only thing I know is we're wrong. Right. How we're wrong was sort of TBD. And at least the bet of ethereum is you can, you know, continue to improve and evolve and address the situations. And I think the big risk is you paint yourself into a corner where you create some sort of thing which is irreversible. Which, by the way, was the whole thing about mev boost was that because of the centralizing forces of mev, if it wasn't addressed immediately at the merge, then it was quite possible and perhaps even likely, that the validator group would become forever centralized. And so again, that's one of the trade offs that was made.
00:43:37.380 - 00:44:24.244, Speaker A: Matt, before we wrap, what has been a fascinating conversation, something I've been asking people lately, mostly because it feels like we're sort of on a precipice of a reignited fervor. Obviously, if you go to ETH CC, if I go to, I was in Nashville at Bitcoin park, which is a fantastic community of bitcoin developers and builders, we feel that there's energy, no doubt, but it also feels like in the market, even in some of the regulatory stuff happening not just in the US but globally, that maybe we're on the precipice of a sort of, I don't want to say even a bull run, but on another reinvigoration of this ecosystem. So what gets you excited sort of in the near term, for, whether it's ethereum or block native or this ecosystem, what are you looking forward to right now? What's getting you hyped?
00:44:24.864 - 00:45:07.016, Speaker C: I would very much agree that there's a lot of positive energy across many ecosystems. That's well earned. And I think that public perception is beginning to shift and we're starting to see the positive movement, at least in the US regulatory environment, that we need. I think near term account abstraction 4337 is super exciting. I gave a talk about this at ECC, where I basically said, just imagine when your credit card can be a non custodial wallet, and now you can enable all sorts of experiences that aren't able before. The example I gave is meet Alice. She's a super fan of this hypothetical music artist named Sailor Twift and she's a top listener.
00:45:07.016 - 00:45:46.080, Speaker C: She contributes, she's got all the merch. Sailor Twift wants to recognize her fans and wants to basically give her best fans differentiated experiences. But the existing infrastructure that she has isn't really useful. She can't use Ticketmaster, for instance, to do that. Well, she could issue an NFT, but then that requires Alice to have a crypto wallet, and Alice doesn't know the first thing about crypto and is probably going to have a bad experience. Screw it up. And so just imagine a world where sailor Twift can do a deal with Spotify to basically drop an NFT into the wallet on to the credit card on file, right? You have Alice showing up for the show because she's a fan.
00:45:46.080 - 00:46:24.848, Speaker C: She shows her wallet on her phone and they say, oh, hey, guess what? You qualify for the special vip experience, right? And she has provable ownership of that. She can transfer, sell it, share it with her friends, et cetera. And it's all super easy and super simple. Better for the artist, it's better for Spotify, it's better for Alice. All made possible by these new principles of crypto and web3, but abstracted away through 4337. This is the big unlock, and we talk a lot about it in the Ethereum ecosystem of onboarding the next billion users. That's either going to happen bottom up organically, we're going to have some killer apps that everyone needs to have, or it's going to happen top down.
00:46:24.848 - 00:47:03.800, Speaker C: We're going to meet users where they are in the existing financial system and bring them on board with differentiated experiences. And we think there's a huge, I personally, there's a huge amount of experience or opportunity for growth for tradfi players to basically deliver new experiences that drive more transactions, greater value, better retention in this brand new continent that's being unlocked called web3. Right. And so I think the setup here is really quite positive for this type of action. And of course, along the way, as we talked about, it introduces all sorts of interesting new infrastructure problems and scalability problems that entities like block native are set up to service. So that's what gets me excited about the next chapter of web3.
