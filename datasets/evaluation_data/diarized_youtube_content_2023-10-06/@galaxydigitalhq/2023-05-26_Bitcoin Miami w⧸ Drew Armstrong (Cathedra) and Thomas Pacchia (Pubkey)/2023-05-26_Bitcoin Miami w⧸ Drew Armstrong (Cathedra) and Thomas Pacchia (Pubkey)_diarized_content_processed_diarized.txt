00:00:50.434 - 00:01:25.178, Speaker A: As always, I'm your host, Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research. Thank you for listening to galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. Wow. I was in Miami all week last week for bitcoin 2023, and I recorded an interview on the pub key bus with Drew Armstrong, founder of Cathedra, Bitcoin, and Thomas Paquia, our friend from pub key NYC. It's a great and fun interview about bitcoin and bitcoin culture. And of course, now I'm back in New York, and we're going to catch up with our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk markets and macro.
00:01:25.178 - 00:01:26.242, Speaker A: But before we get into all of.
00:01:26.258 - 00:01:27.146, Speaker B: That, I need to remind you to.

There's gonna be some cool footage and stuff from Miami, but let's hop right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:01:56.690 - 00:01:57.658, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:57.746 - 00:02:28.334, Speaker A: So I guess the country and the political complex in the country is bogged down with this debt ceiling debate. Let's just start there quickly. I mean, markets seem kind of pinned, at least in crypto, markets have been pinned for a couple of weeks. Bitcoin at like 26 to 27 equities are they look a little choppy I've seen some down days, I've seen some flat days, but everyone's just watching this big event and it currently has no resolution today on Wednesday. Any thought, what are your thoughts on it?
00:02:29.634 - 00:03:01.210, Speaker C: It's another example of dysfunctional government at its finest, partisan politics at its finest, and obviously leaves folks wanting more out of their representatives, first and foremost. Secondly, I think it's relevant for markets, but it's a lot of noise right now. Not that much signal in the sense that I think the real negotiating is going to be closer to the actual.
00:03:01.362 - 00:03:03.602, Speaker A: Like x date, literally right up to it.
00:03:03.658 - 00:03:08.210, Speaker C: Right up to it. Which I think is going to really be around, like June 7, June 8, June 9 there.
00:03:08.242 - 00:03:09.362, Speaker A: So not the June 1.
00:03:09.458 - 00:03:14.578, Speaker C: Not the June 1 that Yellen is saying is like the absolute.
00:03:14.666 - 00:03:16.574, Speaker A: And June 1 is what, next Thursday?
00:03:18.514 - 00:03:46.260, Speaker C: Sooner than that, I think. But, yeah, somewhere around there. Yeah, next Thursday sounds right. So, you know, we've got like a week ish, a week to two weeks to, to officially get something done. I think we will. The question is, once we do get something done, what does that mean for markets? And to be honest, right now it's really tough. There are some fed folks that have been calling for an additional two rate hikes this year.
00:03:46.332 - 00:03:46.984, Speaker B: Wow.
00:03:47.524 - 00:04:04.464, Speaker C: At the same time, we have 30 some odd basis points of cuts priced in for this year. So very divergent from what the market is saying. And there's some folks that are calling for, oh, Q four is going to be really bad recession, like hard landing camp.
00:04:04.544 - 00:04:17.648, Speaker A: I saw David Druck at some CNBC thing, forum out west. He was saying that it's looking pretty clear there'll be some kind of recession, but he said it would be milder. He thought as of this moment, that was his.
00:04:17.696 - 00:04:23.168, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I like the idea of a mild recession back half of the year. Yeah. Q four maybe.
00:04:23.256 - 00:04:28.808, Speaker A: Have we seen any evidence that that's actually, actually starting yet or it's still in the pure prediction phase?
00:04:28.856 - 00:04:29.432, Speaker C: Squint.
00:04:29.568 - 00:04:30.776, Speaker B: So you got a squint in the data.
00:04:30.840 - 00:04:39.096, Speaker C: I mean, so here, there's a couple of things. Like one of the things we like to look at is like second order derivatives or, sorry, first order derivatives of economic data.
00:04:39.240 - 00:04:39.568, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:39.616 - 00:05:51.738, Speaker C: So are like initial jobless claims like going up at an increasing rate or are they, you know, going up at a decreasing rate? And so things of that nature and what we're seeing in that context and some of the other sort of broader leading indicators is that there is some weakness in the US economy. Right. Like small business sentiment surveys like the CFO things, manufacturing, PMI being sub 50 in contraction territory, all of the regional fed surveys being in deep negative territory, the cost of supply chain elements and like all those supply chain metrics that have come down a lot and generally the price of commodities with the exception of oil recently they've generally been trading lower. There are lots of signs that at least the pace of inflation and the pace of economic recovery and growth is cooling. The question is, is it cooling fast enough to bring inflation down, alter fed path and fed policy in a meaningful way? And so that's the real TBD. But yes, there are cracks. Got it right.
00:05:51.738 - 00:06:07.690, Speaker C: Like, you know, look at mortgage applications, they're down a lot, right. You know, credit card spending's up and things of that nature. So there are signs. But like to David Solomon's point, like there aren't like a crazy amount of signs right now.
00:06:07.762 - 00:06:09.746, Speaker A: And they're not like deep scary signs.
00:06:09.810 - 00:06:22.282, Speaker C: They're not. They're not like commercial real estate is like a little scary out there. But again, there was a commercial real estate portfolio sale that went through the other day at decent levels on cre.
00:06:22.378 - 00:06:48.424, Speaker A: Like maybe help explain this to me. One thing I know obviously hurt commercial real estate was COVID and work from home. You've heard municipal leaders, for example, Mayor Eric Adams in New York has pleaded with business to make your employees come back in. Because it's not just the real estate. Coffee shops and the lunch breaks, everything. Yep. It's literally the MTA, subway, taxis.
00:06:48.424 - 00:06:55.812, Speaker A: Is that how is that the main reason? Work from home or what were the other factors like?
00:06:55.948 - 00:07:02.940, Speaker C: Oh no. It's a fundamental change in workplace behavior by the entirety of the US workforce.
00:07:03.092 - 00:07:06.172, Speaker A: Which is work from home even if not from home, even if just some days.
00:07:06.268 - 00:07:06.660, Speaker C: Correct?
00:07:06.732 - 00:07:07.384, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:08.184 - 00:07:13.024, Speaker C: And it's also just folks expectations of what they need when they are working.
00:07:13.144 - 00:07:13.448, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:13.496 - 00:07:17.432, Speaker C: In terms of lounge areas and sunlight.
00:07:17.488 - 00:07:20.976, Speaker A: So you have to build up more expensive offices also correct.
00:07:21.160 - 00:07:37.542, Speaker C: Because all of a sudden there's a bunch of real estate that nobody wants. And it's older, nobody wants the older stuff. The nice stuff is going cheap because there's so much supply. Right. And it costs a lot of money to re outfit old buildings and make them like new.
00:07:37.638 - 00:07:59.518, Speaker A: I saw also, you know, one solution to this has been in some places residential, turning them into residential. But I read this great piece actually. I think it was in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago about like where that's worked and how. And also what types of buildings that's worked on and how like a lot of places including like, a lot of Manhattan is not. You really can't retrofit them.
00:07:59.606 - 00:07:59.902, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:59.958 - 00:08:01.734, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's a huge challenge.
00:08:01.814 - 00:08:03.278, Speaker A: They don't have windows that open, for example.
00:08:03.326 - 00:08:03.574, Speaker C: Correct.
00:08:03.614 - 00:08:06.252, Speaker A: Which you literally need. And residential.
00:08:06.308 - 00:08:24.868, Speaker C: No, these buildings were not designed to be residential. And so, yeah, there is this looming thing of all go through downtown Chicago, downtown San Francisco, not good. It's empty. And like you were saying, the stores and the businesses and the areas are severely impacted.
00:08:24.916 - 00:08:30.156, Speaker A: New York has to be one of the least in one of the best positions compared to some of those other cities, though.
00:08:30.300 - 00:08:32.420, Speaker C: I think it's much better than San Francisco.
00:08:32.492 - 00:08:32.878, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:32.956 - 00:08:35.254, Speaker C: Where they were barely working there to begin with.
00:08:35.834 - 00:08:37.250, Speaker A: A lot of at home tech developers.
00:08:37.282 - 00:08:37.874, Speaker B: And stuff like that.
00:08:37.914 - 00:08:46.690, Speaker C: Exactly, exactly. And so I actually need to follow up on this. But there was a building that was going up for sale. It was a salesforce building in San Francisco.
00:08:46.722 - 00:08:51.554, Speaker A: A salesforce building. One of them, I think Salesforce Tower is the largest building there.
00:08:51.594 - 00:09:06.850, Speaker C: Yeah. But there's another one, the other one that is going up for auction. And it was like purchased in like 2019 or 2018, something like that. I believe it was like for north of like $200 million. And like, it's going for much less than that now.
00:09:06.962 - 00:09:07.654, Speaker A: Wow.
00:09:08.074 - 00:09:17.738, Speaker C: Like, I think it's gonna go for like 60 million or something stupid. And on top of that, it needs like 40 million in additional spending to, like, get it up to snuff.
00:09:17.826 - 00:09:18.274, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:09:18.314 - 00:09:20.058, Speaker D: To like, release, make it even usable.
00:09:20.106 - 00:09:20.754, Speaker B: Really? Yeah. Right.
00:09:20.794 - 00:09:30.306, Speaker C: So it's like, you know, one, and then you have the banking side of things where like, you know, bankers have made loans assuming certain property values.
00:09:30.370 - 00:09:30.970, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:09:31.082 - 00:09:32.066, Speaker C: Certain recovery.
00:09:32.210 - 00:09:33.802, Speaker A: They're pretty long duration loans.
00:09:33.858 - 00:09:34.218, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:34.306 - 00:09:39.890, Speaker C: Depends, but yes. So it's, we'll see what the spillover impacts are.
00:09:39.962 - 00:09:43.570, Speaker A: That's a tough, like pretty long term question for America in general.
00:09:43.682 - 00:09:43.930, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:43.962 - 00:09:45.178, Speaker C: I mean, no, absolutely.
00:09:45.226 - 00:09:46.054, Speaker B: Yeah. Wow.
00:09:46.474 - 00:09:56.786, Speaker C: And it's a really interesting challenge. And so it's like, is all of downtown and modern America, is that ever going to be the same again?
00:09:56.930 - 00:10:03.338, Speaker A: And it's weird because a lot of young people and young workers, they like to live in cities, but they don't want to go into the office.
00:10:03.466 - 00:10:03.818, Speaker C: Correct.
00:10:03.866 - 00:10:16.234, Speaker A: So it's like there's, that's why that conversion residential, if it can be done, is so important. If it can be done. But like I said, I read that it in large part cannot be done with the buildings we have right now.
00:10:16.274 - 00:10:17.378, Speaker C: Correct, correct.
00:10:17.546 - 00:10:25.050, Speaker A: And it takes a long time, by the way, to either knock down and rebuild or retrofit like these are not small projects.
00:10:25.202 - 00:10:26.346, Speaker C: No, no, absolutely.
00:10:26.410 - 00:10:26.866, Speaker B: Wow.
00:10:26.970 - 00:11:10.172, Speaker C: But, yeah, that's just another sort of overhang out there. But we've been talking a lot about the things that are going to impact folks in Q four. Excess savings are going to come down because of student loan repayments, current existing high credit card balances, and credit card balances that are growing at historically high interest rates. We just raised interest rates by 500 plus basis points, et cetera. There's gonna be a lot of things in Q four that we need to kind of see happen, and that are gonna wild, broadly drive weakness.
00:11:10.228 - 00:11:10.540, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:10.612 - 00:11:30.390, Speaker A: All right, so in crypto, we've talked about this before, and I think this is probably still the case, particularly for bitcoin. I think most people are looking at it from here. Paul Tudor Jones, I think, said a couple weeks ago that he loves bitcoin. He'll always have some bitcoin, but right now, you know, they said, would he buy it now?
00:11:30.502 - 00:11:30.870, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:30.942 - 00:11:43.222, Speaker A: Like today, Aaron Ross Sorkin asked him on CNBC, and he's like, he's like, maybe not right now. Like, we had a big run and like, you know, who knows? A lot of people are talking about, like, supply dynamics now.
00:11:43.318 - 00:11:43.598, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:43.646 - 00:12:07.166, Speaker A: Because you do have, I will say you do have the ordinals driven sort of like application layer, possible expansion on bitcoin, which is sort of an interesting, like, maybe that will have an impact on bitcoin performance this year. But that's one thing, supply. What else are we sort of looking at? Like, are you thinking about when it comes to crypto this year? Yeah, no, staking is a thing. It's up. I mean.
00:12:07.230 - 00:12:13.798, Speaker C: No, no, absolutely. I mean, just look at the Lido staking statistics. I think we've already, like, restaked the amount that Celsius unstaked.
00:12:13.886 - 00:12:15.754, Speaker B: Yeah, it's all time high.
00:12:16.054 - 00:12:18.582, Speaker C: And so that's the queue to enter.
00:12:18.638 - 00:12:21.366, Speaker A: Is like 30 plus days now. There's so many people trying to.
00:12:21.430 - 00:13:08.716, Speaker C: Right. So that's a huge story. And I mean, if you just look at gas prices over the past couple months, like, they've been high. Like, people are doing stuff, or maybe it's still memes and dogs, coins and stuff, but people are still doing stuff on chain. So that's constructive. But, you know, for me, generally, like, what I'm looking for is, like, the macro response in bitcoin, right? This is a year where I think gold is probably going to take out its highs and make new trend highs. As folks realize that in the hard landing scenario, if these governments and central banks actually achieve their goal of bringing inflation down, they're going to bring it down to a level where it's going to force them to reengage the monetary sort of spigot.
00:13:08.716 - 00:13:14.228, Speaker C: It's like, wait, we're going to bring inflation down by tanking the economy? What's your response to tanking the economy?
00:13:14.236 - 00:13:15.692, Speaker B: How are you going to stimulate the economy?
00:13:15.788 - 00:13:24.680, Speaker C: Print money again? And so it's like, eventually you're going to get back to that point, and that's when you should see, like, hard money really perform.
00:13:24.752 - 00:13:25.248, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:25.376 - 00:13:29.576, Speaker C: And that's when I would expect bitcoin to sort of go take its next leg.
00:13:29.640 - 00:13:56.896, Speaker A: Okay, here's a tough question, too, and I know that people are many minds in this. I think the consensus is one way that we know, but death ceiling, let's say a default or not even a default. Default is like, who knows how this plays, right? But let's just say, like a 2011 scenario with like a, you know, it gets done, but we get a credit downgrade or something because of it. Like, you know, it's tumultuous. It doesn't end up getting passed perfectly at the end of night. So it's tumultuous. And most people, I think, obviously would say what risk assets perform terribly in that scenario.
00:13:56.896 - 00:14:00.488, Speaker A: I think I saw on CNBC down 10%.
00:14:00.536 - 00:14:01.976, Speaker C: Plus some people, I saw it was.
00:14:02.000 - 00:14:17.040, Speaker A: Down 17% in 2011, leading in. And it was that just on the market's fears about what would happen. And that sort of kicked the politicians into gear to get it done. Isn't there an argument, at least on a fundamental basis, that bitcoin should perform well in that scenario?
00:14:17.112 - 00:14:18.256, Speaker C: I think it should. Theoretically.
00:14:18.360 - 00:14:19.816, Speaker B: I mean, it should moon. Right?
00:14:19.840 - 00:14:21.064, Speaker A: It's a global decentralized.
00:14:21.144 - 00:14:50.536, Speaker C: Absolutely. Should moon. What people need to realize is that the dollar and treasuries are the denominator for everything. Every asset on the planet is measured against dollars and therefore treasuries. When you start having doubts about the denominator of what every asset, currency, you name, it, is measured off of. Yeah. Bitcoin should rally.
00:14:50.600 - 00:14:50.824, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:50.864 - 00:14:54.544, Speaker C: Because it should force you to think, what should my denominator really be?
00:14:54.584 - 00:15:05.200, Speaker A: And what is money? And all those questions, 100%. And it's global. So it's not just Americans, right? I mean, it's like other people losing faith in America or american, you know, the risk free rate. Not. No longer being risk free.
00:15:05.312 - 00:15:06.056, Speaker C: Correct.
00:15:06.240 - 00:15:09.120, Speaker A: Should so. But, you know, what do you think that would?
00:15:09.152 - 00:15:15.392, Speaker C: Let's say no, because right now it trades like a risk asset. So people are going to see s and p down 10%.
00:15:15.448 - 00:15:17.928, Speaker A: So they're going to be like, right, sell everything.
00:15:18.016 - 00:15:36.960, Speaker C: Sell everything that is in. However, I do think that there's a lower bound to bitcoin that, you know, I'd say bitcoin is going to outperform beta adjusted to s and p. Yeah, I tell you, because they're definitely, there's bitcoin trades like part, like partly like a risk asset, but also, you know, similar to gold. Right, right.
00:15:36.992 - 00:15:45.960, Speaker A: Because there's a lot of holders that are view it that way, but not enough traders. And part of that's like. Right, because there's sort of the. And then there's the speculators thing.
00:15:46.032 - 00:15:59.896, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. It's like the, but ultimately, like, like there's no way that a default by the US isn't in theory like a positive development for bitcoin.
00:16:00.000 - 00:16:00.408, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:00.496 - 00:16:34.130, Speaker A: I mean, you're looking for other denominators. Like you said, it's really a story of just, you know, it's been almost 15 years since Bitcoin launched and it's still just not understood well enough. It really does. I think you and I know, and I think our audience does too, really does have properties that make it attractive in an environment like that. It really is. I was saying this, if you want to go be a prepper and hide in your bunker, right, like, well, okay, got some gold, but like, you know, you want to spend that, you're going to have to, like, I don't know what melted or use the whole coin or the whole gold bar, and you're going to have to leave your bunker. You have to go meet someone and trade with it.
00:16:34.130 - 00:16:37.602, Speaker A: But bitcoin you could just send at any time, anywhere.
00:16:37.698 - 00:16:38.098, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:38.186 - 00:16:48.354, Speaker A: And it has these monetary policies that do make it interesting. And gold, like, so it should work in an environment like that. But is it just not enough people know that and not enough people think about it that way?
00:16:48.434 - 00:17:17.418, Speaker C: I think it's just a lack of, of like full thought process. I was running a little long, but I actually do think this is an exercise worth talking about. But basically there's a lot of aspects of bitcoin where you're like, oh, it's a great asset in this scenario, that's a sub five probability event and there's a slew of sub 5% probability events that would make you want to own bitcoin. Right. We are in the middle of one of them.
00:17:17.466 - 00:17:17.698, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:17.746 - 00:17:30.586, Speaker C: The US government not paying its obligations in a world where the US government is not paying its obligations, I want to own alternatives. And crypto being another alternative, especially one.
00:17:30.610 - 00:17:33.402, Speaker A: That you can send. Real estate's great, but I can't pay you in real estate.
00:17:33.498 - 00:17:34.690, Speaker C: No, absolutely.
00:17:34.762 - 00:17:36.494, Speaker A: Gold you can, kind of, but it's not.
00:17:36.794 - 00:17:39.414, Speaker C: And then it's like money confiscation.
00:17:40.154 - 00:17:46.574, Speaker A: We had another one of these, which was any kind of uncertainty in the safety of the banking system. So this year has seen no safety.
00:17:47.104 - 00:18:22.384, Speaker C: You don't trust your bank account, right? Like you lose faith and like, there are bank runs, right? Like this is like, literally you're hitting on these back to back, like, kind of things. But again, these are like one you think about. This is happening in the US, right? The same phenomenon is like every now, right? It's like, wait, guys, we're like, other places don't have debt ceilings, they just keep printing money in their own nonsense. Currencies that continue to devaluate over time. Right, right. And so, like hyperinflation, right? Like we're dealing with an inflation crisis in the US, right, and abroad. I mean, you look, the UK CPI.
00:18:22.424 - 00:18:23.656, Speaker A: Numbers came in hot, right?
00:18:23.680 - 00:18:25.848, Speaker C: Like these, like, the money is just.
00:18:25.936 - 00:18:30.136, Speaker A: Not what properly, it's like the inflation.
00:18:30.200 - 00:18:40.792, Speaker C: Is too damn hot and the monetary responses, like, there's a limit to that, right? Like, you don't want riots on the streets because, like, the economy is tanking and food prices are still soaring.
00:18:40.848 - 00:18:41.544, Speaker B: Yeah. Right?
00:18:41.584 - 00:19:19.768, Speaker C: And so you are hitting on like, all of these like, stress scenarios where if you were like, thinking back like two years ago, three years ago, or at any point in time, you're like, what are some of the tail scenarios? That should mean that bitcoin's got more value and you're hitting on so many of them. And so that's why for me, even though I see price action, that isn't great at times, it's just a matter of time. If you just pv this kind of behavioral response function over time versus what we know are going to be our challenges going forward, right? Like the value is just way higher. Cause it's an option on all this stuff.
00:19:19.816 - 00:19:25.368, Speaker A: And so anyway, love it. Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading. As always, my friend, great to see you.
00:19:25.416 - 00:19:26.164, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:19:28.024 - 00:19:55.634, Speaker A: Bitcoin was on full display last week in Miami beach, where I was rolling up to the conference with my friend Nick Carter on his motorcycle. And the video you see is us on the back. And we're rolling up to bitcoin 2023 because I'm gonna do this interview with Thomas Pacquiao and drew Armstrong on the pub key bus, which was a crazy looking graffiti bus sitting on the main convention floor of bitcoin 2023. And it's a fun interview. You're going to enjoy it. Let's roll it.
00:19:56.374 - 00:20:19.010, Speaker B: Welcome to Galaxy Brains on site in Miami. We are on the pub key bus, and I am joined by two good friends of pub Key fame, Thomas Pacquiao and drew Armstrong, CEO of Cathedral Bitcoin, president and COo president, COO of Cathedral Bitcoin, a bitcoin mining firm. Drew. Thomas, great to see you. Thank you for having me on the pub key bus.
00:20:19.082 - 00:20:19.938, Speaker D: Thank you for being here.
00:20:19.986 - 00:20:22.974, Speaker B: It's amazing our viewers can see behind me.
00:20:23.554 - 00:20:24.834, Speaker D: It doesn't have to make sense.
00:20:24.874 - 00:20:30.858, Speaker B: So we. You were just saying you had a little bit of a wild day, Thomas. Like, what were you. So we were out a little bit late last night.
00:20:30.906 - 00:20:33.962, Speaker D: We had a late one. We had a fun one. We did, yeah.
00:20:34.138 - 00:20:37.122, Speaker B: But now you've been doing a bunch of podcasting and stuff.
00:20:37.218 - 00:21:02.414, Speaker D: Then we did a few. We had Jensen. So Junseth is half of bitcoin uncensored, which I think was the first Bitcoin podcast. There were probably other bitcoin podcasts, but they were the first ones to really, like, synthesize the culture around, like, bitcoin talk. We're talking about Skype, one of the early forums to talk about bitcoin. I didn't even know this was on. Was on Skype, Irc.
00:21:02.414 - 00:21:18.090, Speaker D: We touched on a lot of topics, and then we had a hard right turn, and we interviewed Chris Cyborg, one of the most prolific female fighters, mma fighters, like, 14 years undefeated.
00:21:18.242 - 00:21:18.762, Speaker B: Incredible.
00:21:18.818 - 00:21:25.574, Speaker D: That was incredible. We tried to get one of our partners to arm wrestle her, but that didn't work out. She would have broke his arm.
00:21:26.834 - 00:21:34.972, Speaker B: Oh, my gosh. But you. What is the story behind the bus? I mean, we all know we did a podcast a couple weeks ago, told our audience about pub key.
00:21:35.028 - 00:21:35.664, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:21:36.044 - 00:21:39.988, Speaker B: This bus is literally incredible. Did you drive the bus from New York to Miami?
00:21:40.036 - 00:21:50.460, Speaker D: No, we rented it. We were looking for a pontoon boat, but they were giving us prices for a pontoon boat that's actually, like, on the water in Miami. We were looking for, like, a broken one.
00:21:50.532 - 00:21:53.884, Speaker B: Yeah, you wanted to, like. That's funny. Had it to roll it up here in the conference.
00:21:53.964 - 00:22:07.002, Speaker D: Like, if it's already on wheels, just, like, wheel it in and be the whole, like, I lost my private keys on a. In a boating accident thing. And then one thing led to another. We found this ridiculous bus that kind of smells like laser tag.
00:22:07.178 - 00:22:09.122, Speaker E: It smells and looks like laser tag.
00:22:09.178 - 00:22:10.562, Speaker B: It does, yeah.
00:22:10.698 - 00:22:20.994, Speaker D: And it has this, like, it has this very funny, like, you know, collection of, like, you know, disconnected nineties memes.
00:22:21.114 - 00:22:23.654, Speaker B: Yeah. Like lots of Vader.
00:22:24.554 - 00:22:25.770, Speaker E: It's very disjointed.
00:22:25.842 - 00:22:26.746, Speaker B: Very. Yeah.
00:22:26.810 - 00:22:32.898, Speaker E: Now it's great, though. We do see some nice cassettes prominently featured in the art, which is also something you love to see. Big fans of cassettes.
00:22:32.946 - 00:22:44.946, Speaker B: Have you guys seen anything programming wise at the conference yet? Or is. I mean, this is Dave, whether it's Thursday, so it's like the first 6 hours of general admission for this two day thing. But anything that's striking you about the conference this year?
00:22:45.010 - 00:23:11.710, Speaker E: So I guess maybe first answer your question about the programming. Did just see two grown men dressed in children's wizards costumes discussing. Discussing ordinals and. Yeah, I mean, you know, I think we talk. We talk a lot about ordinals at a lot of the pub key events and pub key meetups. They exist. And I agree with sort of the fatalist mindset that Thomas has been proposing, which is, you know, we need to figure out if there's a way to use bitcoin.
00:23:11.710 - 00:23:13.430, Speaker E: We should just use it to see if we can break it.
00:23:13.462 - 00:23:14.042, Speaker B: Yep.
00:23:14.198 - 00:23:40.774, Speaker E: And, you know, cats out the bag with ordinals. I increasingly just think that ordinals, it's like just a matter of taste, I think ordinal, it's just, you know, you have censorship resistant freedom money. You have, I think what's one of the most important innovations in, really, the history of humanity in bitcoin, and we're choosing to make JPEG rocks. Got it. Okay. Now, graffiti, a time old tradition. Who am I to tell other people what they can and can't do with the block space? But for me, it's a bit tiresome.
00:23:40.774 - 00:23:43.898, Speaker E: But I'd say also on the whole, just a conference in general this year.
00:23:43.946 - 00:23:44.194, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:44.234 - 00:23:47.674, Speaker E: It's way less frothy than 2021, 2022.
00:23:47.754 - 00:23:48.082, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:48.138 - 00:23:54.962, Speaker E: You can tell that we're sort of in a bear market here, but it's actually really nice because they're less random shit corners, pumping their, you know, shilling their bags.
00:23:55.018 - 00:23:55.978, Speaker D: It's still Miami.
00:23:56.026 - 00:23:56.442, Speaker E: It's still my.
00:23:56.458 - 00:23:59.074, Speaker D: So some of that, some of the riffraff.
00:23:59.114 - 00:24:01.242, Speaker E: But like, there's like a reasonable amount of riffraff.
00:24:01.298 - 00:24:01.794, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:01.914 - 00:24:04.522, Speaker E: And it's just great seeing all the bitcoin errs that you love.
00:24:04.618 - 00:24:05.010, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:05.082 - 00:24:16.016, Speaker E: And to not really, really. Did you. Everywhere you turn, you see another just great bitcoin. Or, you know, someone who's like, medium post you read in 2020. Wow. You are like, I love. You know, I love your whole.
00:24:16.080 - 00:24:16.584, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:16.704 - 00:24:17.328, Speaker E: Contribution.
00:24:17.416 - 00:24:37.938, Speaker B: I would say that that's absolutely my impression to drew. The bitcoiners came out for this conference. There was some noise on Twitter, mostly around ordinals. Right. They're mad. There are some anti ordinal activist bitcoiners who are mad at Bitcoin Inc. Because bitcoin magazine likes ordinals and had proposed, like, boycotting the conference.
00:24:37.938 - 00:25:00.236, Speaker B: Well, I don't remember exactly who those people were that said that, but I can tell you I've seen literally hundreds of my favorite bitcoin errs here. It's been awesome. It is smaller. That makes it a lot. Last year, 22, it was like, dude, I think I did 20,000 steps. And just during the day at the conference, one of the days. It's an incredibly massive venue here in Miami that they actually did fill last year, which is crazy.
00:25:00.236 - 00:25:02.052, Speaker B: There was, like, 30,000 people here last year.
00:25:02.108 - 00:25:03.236, Speaker D: And 21 was huge.
00:25:03.300 - 00:25:05.244, Speaker B: 21 two. And Wynwood, that was a good one, too.
00:25:05.284 - 00:25:06.300, Speaker A: It was very hot.
00:25:06.452 - 00:25:09.540, Speaker E: It was hot. That one was actually obscene. That was so large.
00:25:09.612 - 00:25:11.788, Speaker B: Yeah. And that was, um, right on the.
00:25:11.796 - 00:25:13.804, Speaker D: Back of COVID It was, like, excited.
00:25:13.924 - 00:25:27.728, Speaker B: I think it was. Yeah, yeah, it was. Yeah, it was. And I think it was also that at the time, it was the largest conference in the world since COVID lockdown. Wow. So it had actually been like. It was huge.
00:25:27.728 - 00:25:36.784, Speaker B: It was huge. I agree. The ordinals thing, I think the fatal. That's fine. I think, you know, it is sort of to each his own. I think as long as I. Not that you can't.
00:25:36.784 - 00:25:44.968, Speaker B: But I think when people, if you're going to spend all your time complaining about how they shouldn't be doing it, like, that's a waste of your time. You know, just like, I actually don't.
00:25:45.016 - 00:25:58.156, Speaker D: See a lot of the. I think that the. The maxi are complaining. Maxis hate ordinals. Like, babies are dying. Like, thing is mostly generated from the ordinals crew, and I think it's very effective. It's an amplifier.
00:25:58.220 - 00:25:58.556, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:58.620 - 00:26:06.036, Speaker D: But I don't see a lot of, you know, quote unquote, like, bitcoin naxis that are actually, like, vocally upset.
00:26:06.140 - 00:26:06.824, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:07.364 - 00:26:28.296, Speaker D: So, and. And if you go to, like, the. The tried and true ones, like a mister hodl or something, somebody like that, there's a little bit of a deeper discussion. Like, if block space has value, it will be used at a certain price. And it's okay for that to be used with inscriptions. And it doesn't matter what the inscription is. These are valid transactions that people are paying for.
00:26:28.296 - 00:26:49.804, Speaker D: It's not spam, it's not an attack. They're valid transactions. And I think that ordinals are just an overwhelmingly positive development. It's pushing a lot of, a lot of the, the transactions to L2 lightning liquid, blah, blah, blah, and blocks are full. So miners are happy, transaction fees go up. This is important stuff.
00:26:49.884 - 00:27:01.740, Speaker E: And I totally agree. And I think now I will say that I think the Maxis were right to call out the danger initially when it first happened, that it's like, hey, this could have some pretty big ramifications, not all them positive, but again, cats out the bag.
00:27:01.812 - 00:27:02.300, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:02.412 - 00:27:06.052, Speaker E: And it certainly is. You know, I agree that I think.
00:27:06.188 - 00:27:11.226, Speaker D: What are the, like, the negative, like, you know, consequences of ordinances?
00:27:11.250 - 00:27:13.626, Speaker B: You want me to run down some of them? Yeah, we had them in our paper.
00:27:13.690 - 00:27:15.498, Speaker E: Let's talk about you. Yeah, you wrote the paper back.
00:27:15.546 - 00:27:34.496, Speaker B: We have a whole list. I mean, I think one of the first ones people said was that you don't want node runners to have to store this data, and it will make it harder to run a node. And so, like, and when we're like, let's be real, dude. I mean, I can go to best buy and get a two terabyte hard drive anywhere, right? And then, so then the argument was, well, what about the global, what about the global south and blah, blah, blah. Okay, that's.
00:27:34.520 - 00:27:35.288, Speaker D: The babies are dying.
00:27:35.336 - 00:27:47.760, Speaker B: Me. Yes, it is. It is. Roger, that was so good. It was that, and some people said that, right? Yeah, but it's obviously mitigated by the fact, which they pointed out on stage. But it's, well, it's pruneable. All the state is totally prunable.
00:27:47.760 - 00:28:08.012, Speaker B: Yeah. Now, technically, with a base like bitcoin core implementation, you're gonna have to download it first, and then you can prune it, but you can also use or disrespect or whatever these tools that like Luke Junior and others are making to not download in the first place. So again, fear mitigated. The other one that I thought was interesting, but we did some math and just think it's not a real issue is the fungibility.
00:28:08.108 - 00:28:12.124, Speaker D: Quick, quick note on that. The first two are non technical issues.
00:28:12.244 - 00:28:14.684, Speaker B: Right? So those are those companies.
00:28:14.724 - 00:28:14.900, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:14.932 - 00:28:18.460, Speaker B: It's just like, oh, do the right people that we want to be using bitcoin? Can they?
00:28:18.532 - 00:28:19.284, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:28:19.444 - 00:28:20.580, Speaker D: And then what's the next?
00:28:20.612 - 00:28:51.206, Speaker B: So fungibility was interesting because they said, well, we, we want, you know, one BTC to equal one BTC wouldn't be like, encumbering a Sat with, like, a bunch of external to the protocol value. Right. We want it. So it's more about the asset BTC. Right, but how. So each ordinal is one sat with 9999 sats attached to it for postage. So basically, for every inscribed ordinal, it's 10,000 sats are basically now associated with this NFT if it is an NFT.
00:28:51.206 - 00:29:03.686, Speaker B: Right. So now you got 10,000 sats per ordinal. But if you do the math like it, with 5500 million inscriptions, would. Would only encumber, like, 50,000 bitcoin. There's 19.2 million of them. Right.
00:29:03.686 - 00:29:15.418, Speaker B: Like. So even under the most aggressive growth scenarios we came up with for ordinals, like, it's .05% of the supply that would even be tainted if you viewed it that way. Yeah.
00:29:15.606 - 00:29:30.058, Speaker E: Yeah, it does do. It is, I think a little. It is interesting, though, where basically, if you take ordinals to the logical extreme, you basically. Then each set has called, like, the values, like, the max of whatever the inscription is.
00:29:30.106 - 00:29:30.378, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:30.426 - 00:29:47.414, Speaker E: That's associated with it, or just one sat. And, you know, I think that it's like, the fungibility thing, I think, is definitely, you know, I can. I can see that being concerned. I think the reality is, in my view, bitcoin, the use of censorship is just a money, and, like, sound money will be the dominant use case, for sure. What was the most important use case.
00:29:47.454 - 00:29:47.814, Speaker B: Agreed.
00:29:47.854 - 00:30:04.062, Speaker E: But I mean, I think the other. The other risk, and this is. I know, you know, there's already been all this fud over the years about, like, things like child pornography and other illicit content. But I think when you have nodes actually potentially storing that because it's inscribed. Yeah, I do think that for me, it just increases the regulatory attack surface.
00:30:04.158 - 00:30:04.558, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:04.646 - 00:30:08.826, Speaker E: And I think that that is what really consumes. And I think that's what some of the Maxis did a great job.
00:30:08.850 - 00:30:17.514, Speaker B: Well, that's. That's kind of interesting because that's not what most of the people are. That's not about the token part, the ordinal part, the fungibility question. You're actually talking about the inscribed data.
00:30:17.594 - 00:30:28.434, Speaker E: Being risk data, which, if you're a full node, you have the inscribed data on your. On your SSD. You know, is the US government gonna basically say, oh, well, now you're actually, you know, you're storing.
00:30:28.474 - 00:30:29.042, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:30:29.098 - 00:30:31.050, Speaker E: This distributing this.
00:30:31.082 - 00:30:36.664, Speaker B: Well, maybe I'm in the US may imagine just an even much more authoritarian country. You could definitely be at risk now, actually.
00:30:36.704 - 00:30:54.168, Speaker E: And I think this is really. It highlights a very interesting kind of broader point, too, which is just so. Okay, regulator could say that. And as we all know, you know, no country can ban bitcoin. They can just ban themselves from bitcoin. And. But effectively, it kind of highlights just the asymmetry of decentralized technologies like, you know, the Internet, like bitcoin.
00:30:54.216 - 00:30:54.520, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:54.592 - 00:31:04.698, Speaker E: Where there's just like, no way you can actually prevent that. And like, the technology is. And the technology is a very robust organism in bitcoin. It's very robust and it will. It will survive.
00:31:04.786 - 00:31:05.298, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:05.426 - 00:31:21.546, Speaker E: And so it kind of just shows the. How traditional legal structures, just ill equipped to deal with the technology like this. Just like you can't control the Internet, you can't control bitcoin. Now, some. Some might try and so it might be bad for some call it like, mainstream adoption if different states try to go after. But that. That I think, for me, is the real danger.
00:31:21.610 - 00:31:25.216, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a great point. That's. We talked about this at Pubc a little bit.
00:31:25.240 - 00:31:37.528, Speaker D: It is a two edged sword. Right? So in a way, inscriptions, you know, some of the capabilities that taproot enabled does NFts better than other chains.
00:31:37.616 - 00:31:37.888, Speaker E: Right.
00:31:37.936 - 00:31:51.116, Speaker D: Where there's a link in a smart contract that points to a database that can be like centralized, controlled and everything. Yeah, exactly. For. For bitcoin inscriptions, you're actually like, downloading the inscriptions data.
00:31:51.220 - 00:31:51.596, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:51.660 - 00:31:54.676, Speaker D: So it's deeply problematic for certain types of content.
00:31:54.860 - 00:31:55.300, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:55.372 - 00:31:56.868, Speaker D: It's also very empowering.
00:31:56.916 - 00:31:57.148, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:57.196 - 00:32:01.092, Speaker D: You can think about it as a notary service. This is time stamping on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:32:01.108 - 00:32:13.264, Speaker B: It's funny. You know what they call it in crypto blockchain land. We're talking about data availability layer. We now have an incredibly robust amount of blob space, which is. I mean, I'm using the Ethereum terms, which I think is actually a really funny thing about this.
00:32:13.844 - 00:32:15.692, Speaker E: The blue mat. Talk about me. The.
00:32:15.788 - 00:32:38.716, Speaker B: That's what I was going to bring up. By the way, you. Yours was more interesting. But I was saying, another good argument against is that any types, it's not just inscriptions. Any type of, like, external protocol operations that happen on the consensus layer open up mev opportunities. And there already are some major ones from inscriptions. But if we even go step further with, like, if we start seeing roll ups, I mean, I want, like, better l two s.
00:32:38.716 - 00:32:49.950, Speaker B: I like the l two s. We have. I want additional ones. Yeah. The layered scaling community broadly in crypto has made a lot of progress since state channels were invented. Right. There are other things.
00:32:49.950 - 00:33:15.202, Speaker B: I love sovereign roll ups I would like. There's other things I would like. But those will also add a lot of mev opportunities into bitcoin. And that, that is a risk. That, and I think Eric wall actually on stage was very correct earlier when he said, guys, there's going to be mev on bitcoin and you're like six years behind trying to figure out how to mitigate it. The Ethereum community has been actively working on mitigations for years and bitcoiners barely understand what it is.
00:33:15.298 - 00:33:18.010, Speaker D: The mitigation now is just an auction. Right, for the stakeholders.
00:33:18.042 - 00:33:21.850, Speaker B: Yeah, but you can, but basically. Well, I think if they're mitigation is.
00:33:22.002 - 00:33:23.266, Speaker D: Failed this test miserable.
00:33:23.330 - 00:33:27.394, Speaker B: It may have, but I mean, still, they've gone down all the paths already like, and we haven't.
00:33:27.434 - 00:33:29.682, Speaker D: So like they all end at the same, the same spot.
00:33:29.738 - 00:33:34.966, Speaker B: I'm critically. No, no, there's been improvements. There are improvements. I mean, I'm not gonna say it's gotten worse. I'm not gonna say that.
00:33:35.010 - 00:33:38.478, Speaker E: I mean, I think Eric was also just being particularly pedantic on stage, but he did make some good points.
00:33:38.526 - 00:33:51.918, Speaker B: Yeah, well, and also to your point, you were saying about the, whether some Maxis are actually that angry vocal, 100% UD and Eric are intentionally trolling. They're drumming Usher, they're intentionally drumming up the opposition.
00:33:52.006 - 00:33:54.238, Speaker D: It's a good megaphone. Yeah, because it speaks to, I have.
00:33:54.246 - 00:33:57.078, Speaker B: To say it is pretty funny too. They're like edge lording basically.
00:33:57.126 - 00:34:00.482, Speaker D: It's like, it's the broader crypto audience really like loves that stuff.
00:34:00.558 - 00:34:13.786, Speaker E: Yeah, no, they love it because they give them, you know, this, like, this tribal conflict. But I mean, they've totally made a pantomime villain out of the Maxis. Right. Yeah, the Maxis. You know, I don't think any Maxis like really like obvious. I think, again, it just comes down to like being in poor taste effectively.
00:34:13.850 - 00:34:14.450, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:14.602 - 00:34:24.442, Speaker D: But I think like that Musk interview with BBC where it's just like, give me one example. Like show me like who is, who is raging and crying over ordinals. Show me. Yeah, example.
00:34:24.498 - 00:34:31.756, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not many. You're right, you're right. And we were out with all of our good bitcoin or friends and basically this topic didn't come up once. Nobody, nobody really cares as far as I can tell.
00:34:31.820 - 00:34:34.404, Speaker D: Look, there are good topics to dive into.
00:34:34.484 - 00:34:35.596, Speaker B: Yeah. It's interesting.
00:34:35.700 - 00:34:39.052, Speaker D: I don't really see the tears to engage in.
00:34:39.068 - 00:34:43.172, Speaker E: Good faith. I will also say, like, going back to when I, you know, I got into bitcoin in, like, 2017.
00:34:43.268 - 00:34:43.500, Speaker B: Right?
00:34:43.532 - 00:34:46.100, Speaker E: Like, during. As a child of that bull market.
00:34:46.172 - 00:34:46.468, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:46.516 - 00:34:57.727, Speaker E: And it's. I do remember 2018, 2019, when I'm, you know, I'm a Mac. I'm. Now I'm actually. I'm talking to myself, Normie friends, and my Normie friends are talking about, you know, smart contract platform, a world computer.
00:34:57.775 - 00:34:58.023, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:58.063 - 00:35:19.956, Speaker E: And I'm basically trying to combat those. And I remember one of the talking points that I gave at the time. Of course, you know, I did. My understanding was not as, like, nearly as deep as it is now, but I was like, oh, eventually, that's all gonna be built on bitcoin, because if you really need decentralization, it's gonna be built on bitcoin. And now I think this is a great first example of, you know, like, lightning was a great example of, oh, if you need scalable payments, you just do that on bitcoin. Now. Nfts.
00:35:19.956 - 00:35:27.836, Speaker E: Oh, if you really. I'm not sure why you ever really need the NFT to be decentralized, but you copy, copy, paste, digital collectible. Sure.
00:35:27.900 - 00:35:29.504, Speaker D: Milady. Milady, millennial.
00:35:29.884 - 00:35:37.236, Speaker E: But, like, now. Now it's sort of. It's like the pressing a red button moment where it's just like, everything's eventually gonna be built on bitcoin. Like, no, it's a dumb money protocol.
00:35:37.300 - 00:35:37.500, Speaker B: Right?
00:35:37.532 - 00:35:41.388, Speaker E: Like, so I think there's, like, some. Maybe some cognitive dissonance there.
00:35:41.436 - 00:35:41.900, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:42.012 - 00:35:44.352, Speaker E: Especially now that it's, like, here, but, well, this is.
00:35:44.468 - 00:35:49.976, Speaker B: That is. Was the OG concept that. Right. Everything. All the altcoins are test nets for. Bitcoin was the concept. And.
00:35:49.976 - 00:36:17.588, Speaker B: And this is a. Pete Rizzo has a really good way of thinking about this, which is monetary maximalists, which is sort of like the, you know, bitcoin sound money. That's, like, kind of the dominant bitcoin culture of the last few years. But then he calls them platform maximalist, which used to be like, yes, I like BTC, the asset, but actually, I like bitcoin as a platform upon which to build. And that has obviously fallen by the wayside for years. Right. This is opening that interesting culture clash again.
00:36:17.676 - 00:36:43.960, Speaker E: No, I think. I think it's true. And I think I've actually been thinking about this in terms of evolution of bitcoin businesses and, like, businesses in bitcoin. And I think maybe, like, you know, generation one is, like, a business that's, like, directly, like, serving bitcoin or helping, you know, make an exchange, making bitcoin more easier to use or maybe, like, some sort of custody business, something like that. Generation two potentially is using, you know, the bitcoin network as a tool, and it's building a business around bitcoin, the network. So, like, strike or something like that.
00:36:43.992 - 00:36:44.392, Speaker B: Yep.
00:36:44.488 - 00:36:56.024, Speaker E: And then I wonder if, like, basically the third generation of bitcoin business is really. Or the third iteration of it is actually something that Steve Barber's been doing for a while, which is just. You're just like, a business. Like, I mean, Steve's business does actually touch bitcoin.
00:36:56.064 - 00:36:56.336, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:56.400 - 00:37:00.084, Speaker E: We're talking about normal businesses that just hodl a portion of their.
00:37:00.424 - 00:37:02.366, Speaker B: Yeah, they just hold bitcoin or buy it or.
00:37:02.440 - 00:37:04.346, Speaker E: Yeah, like, not every business is gonna be a bitcoin.
00:37:04.370 - 00:37:17.034, Speaker B: I actually love this. Somebody was asking someone on Twitter a while ago, randomly, like, hey, I really like bitcoin. How do I get. I want to work on it full time? They were like. And somebody replied. They're like, well, what do you do now? And he's like, well, I'm a doctor. And they're like, dude, just be a doctor who loves bitcoin.
00:37:17.034 - 00:37:22.122, Speaker B: Just, like, buy bitcoin and be a doctor. You don't have to, like, work in bitcoin, necessarily.
00:37:22.178 - 00:37:23.578, Speaker D: Why can't you be normal?
00:37:23.706 - 00:37:29.744, Speaker B: Well, I. Why can't we be normal? I think everyone knows we're not normal. Look at where we're sitting right now, Thomas.
00:37:30.364 - 00:37:44.844, Speaker E: But, like, along these lines, doing. I was joking with. With a friend who's, you know, been building a bitcoin company since 2018. And as I was talking to her, she. We basically both were just like, yeah, you know, if we had. We kept some, like, cushy fiat job and just stacked bitcoin.
00:37:44.884 - 00:37:45.060, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:45.092 - 00:38:00.056, Speaker E: Never really felt the compulsion to go and work and contribute to space. Maybe we actually would end up with some more bitcoin than we have right now. You know, you don't like to do that calculus, but, like, yeah, it is. I. You know, you. You can understand why people, you know, like, this doctor is like, I feel this compulsion to contribute to bitcoin.
00:38:00.080 - 00:38:01.504, Speaker B: I get it. We all feel it, too.
00:38:01.584 - 00:38:02.216, Speaker E: That's why we're here.
00:38:02.240 - 00:38:02.816, Speaker B: That's exactly.
00:38:02.840 - 00:38:04.648, Speaker E: But at the same time, world still need doctors.
00:38:04.696 - 00:38:09.040, Speaker B: And it's like, dude, you might already have a good job. That sounds like a pretty doctor. It sounds like pretty good shock.
00:38:09.152 - 00:38:15.784, Speaker D: But there's something really amazing embedded in that. Like, the bitcoin businesses, the startups are really difficult.
00:38:15.864 - 00:38:16.336, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:16.440 - 00:38:17.640, Speaker D: They've been, like, crushing.
00:38:17.712 - 00:38:18.328, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:38:18.416 - 00:38:28.444, Speaker D: But you still have people that are really excited, really passionate about the industry. It's like, how can I dive into this? And it's just like, you want to. You want to dive into this, into that. This asset pool.
00:38:28.524 - 00:38:36.404, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's true. We talked about this a lot. We do. A lot of, you know, our listeners, we know you guys both know, too. We cover venture in crypto at Galaxy Research.
00:38:36.564 - 00:38:37.388, Speaker A: And it.
00:38:37.436 - 00:39:05.420, Speaker B: Last year, the end of last year, I. Or last bitcoin conference, I did a panel. I moderated a panel with our friend Christopher Calicott from TMP and Grant Gilliam from 1031 and a couple and two others. I can't remember the whole panel, but it was about bitcoin VC. And one of the things I said was $30 billion was invested in 2021 by venture capitalists in crypto startups. And by my count, 99.5% of it went to non bitcoin companies.
00:39:05.532 - 00:39:06.516, Speaker D: That's a shame.
00:39:06.700 - 00:39:09.940, Speaker B: It is a shame, but it's also hard to build a scalable because think.
00:39:09.972 - 00:39:12.094, Speaker D: About which companies VC's want tokens.
00:39:12.134 - 00:39:28.350, Speaker B: Well, not just that, but think about what they do, but think about what businesses actually have been profitable in this space. They're almost all exchanges, basically, historically. And like, a bitcoin only exchange is not nearly as profitable a business as, you know, a multi asset exchange. And so it's always been hard, actually.
00:39:28.382 - 00:39:52.228, Speaker E: It's funny going back to even my days at Galaxy when it was doing on the venture team and the investment banking team back in 2019, I just joined out of investment banking. We were basically mapping out the. The coverage universe for, like, crypto. Yeah, all the companies. And at the time, we were all just like, okay. Or as you know, AJ and I are, like, chatting about it just like the only two businesses that have ever made money in crypto, like reliably or miners and exchanges.
00:39:52.276 - 00:39:52.668, Speaker B: Yes.
00:39:52.756 - 00:39:56.988, Speaker E: Now, miners also might, you know, a lot of times, business, but, yeah, business, but like those.
00:39:57.076 - 00:40:03.536, Speaker B: But also the mining machine manufacturers, like bitmain, you know, what's my microbt?
00:40:03.640 - 00:40:05.208, Speaker D: Yeah, labs.
00:40:05.296 - 00:40:21.504, Speaker E: But of course, shout out. But I mean, yeah, so I think, like, I think you're absolutely right that the majority of VC's are not, you know, majority venture capital is not going to bitcoin companies. Now, I think one. One thing we kind of also need to just be aware of is how interest rates are now 5% higher.
00:40:21.544 - 00:40:22.280, Speaker B: Yo. Yeah.
00:40:22.432 - 00:40:24.280, Speaker E: Now than they were like, well, all.
00:40:24.312 - 00:40:39.022, Speaker B: VC's crushed this year. It's down a lot. I mean, actually, I've been impressed that the blockchain VC sector is actually doing okay, but it's down huge. I mean, we're, I think we're on track for maybe 10 billion allocated that that'll be a third of the last of each of the last two years.
00:40:39.198 - 00:40:51.206, Speaker E: But, but I think, you know, the reality is that I don't think every business needs to be this like hyper scale or like this hyper growth, like venture startup. Like, you know, time was for most of human history.
00:40:51.270 - 00:40:51.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:51.534 - 00:40:53.794, Speaker E: You didn't go from being like, from.
00:40:54.154 - 00:40:55.946, Speaker B: To scaling to a thousand people.
00:40:56.010 - 00:41:00.418, Speaker E: Yes. Or to being like a unicorn within like five years. You know, most of the time, like.
00:41:00.546 - 00:41:01.370, Speaker D: Don'T talk to me.
00:41:01.402 - 00:41:04.498, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly. Like it needs to return the whole fund or I don't want to talk.
00:41:04.546 - 00:41:04.850, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:04.922 - 00:41:12.050, Speaker E: And I think that the, the reality is that for most of human history, it's been about, you know, accumulating capital at much lower, you know, growth rate.
00:41:12.082 - 00:41:17.978, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you could borrow and from a bank instead of raising growth, equity capital or whatever. I agree.
00:41:18.066 - 00:41:26.454, Speaker E: And this is all that visa, the low interest rate VC landscape has just also led to some like perverse incentives where it's like growth at all costs. One, this effectively happened to blockfi.
00:41:26.494 - 00:41:26.622, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:26.638 - 00:41:29.314, Speaker E: Where like they were just so focused on growth.
00:41:30.054 - 00:41:52.834, Speaker B: And it's absolutely high type reference behavior also venture. No, I agree. That is a product of low interest rates. Another comment I wanted to make too, on the, on this bitcoin versus like crypto company thing. I've talked to a lot of allocators over the years, big, big investors, right. And they say, you know, we try to get them involved in liquid, like, you know, own some bitcoin actually on your balance sheet or whatever. Like buy the asset.
00:41:52.834 - 00:41:53.194, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:53.274 - 00:41:54.210, Speaker D: Stream liquid.
00:41:54.362 - 00:41:56.602, Speaker B: No, I mean like liquid versus illiquid investment.
00:41:56.698 - 00:41:56.954, Speaker E: Right.
00:41:56.994 - 00:41:57.546, Speaker B: Investing. Right.
00:41:57.570 - 00:41:59.458, Speaker D: So like own the asset.
00:41:59.546 - 00:42:13.154, Speaker B: Yeah, like own the asset. Don't, like, don't not own the asset. Like, I mean, do whatever. But what we would often find, and it's improved a lot since then, but like partly because custody is hard. Oh, they're not allowed to hold it. Weird alt asset in their vehicle or whatever. Right.
00:42:13.194 - 00:42:14.546, Speaker E: Some funds can only hold securities.
00:42:14.610 - 00:42:36.202, Speaker B: Yeah. So then they, so that what would often happen is they said, you know what I think we're gonna do? We're just gonna do venture because we know venture. All these big funds, they have venture. Right. So I'm like, okay, that's fine, but back to the point I made earlier, you need to know that you're actually short bitcoin in that spot. It's totally fine. You want to do crypto VC know that, like, the, that is structurally underweight bitcoin.
00:42:36.202 - 00:42:47.758, Speaker B: Like, it's fine, but, but if that's your strategy, all power to you. But know that you are actively trading it that way. So buy some bitcoins and do your crypto VC if you want to. If you want to. You know, I mean, otherwise you're structurally underweight.
00:42:47.806 - 00:43:17.014, Speaker E: And it's like the siren song of bitcoin denominated returns, where, like, I think it's something you, people talk about a lot in mining, but the same logical. It's true. And, you know, a lot of times people are focused on, say, gross margins in mining, right? Where it's like, I want, you know, $0.01 power. But if it takes you like, five years to build out a site with $0.01 power, then you're short bitcoin for five years, and you've already gone through a halving and network cash rates probably way higher. So, yeah, I think, I think you're totally right where you actually rule number one, you need to know the game you're playing.
00:43:17.794 - 00:43:20.674, Speaker B: Love it. All right, just let's wrap it up. But what else?
00:43:20.714 - 00:43:22.194, Speaker D: The VC's love the tokens, right?
00:43:22.234 - 00:43:25.322, Speaker B: They did liquidity. Well, they kind of invented the token game.
00:43:25.458 - 00:43:27.314, Speaker D: And it makes sense. It makes sense for the model.
00:43:27.354 - 00:43:48.740, Speaker B: But the irony is that it's, if the ICO hadn't been deemed illegal, that ICO being deemed like an illegal securities offering for the mass, all of them, the concept of it by the SEC being an illegal securities offering. Right. Yeah. Like the public ICO, that led all the venture funds to do private, private, like simple agreements for future tokens. Right. Which is zapped. Yeah.
00:43:48.740 - 00:44:12.534, Speaker B: Which means that all, if you actually go and look at the distributions, the decentralization of all the altcoins over the years, everything that did the public ICO is significantly more decentralized than all the newer protocols. So, like, ETH and Cardano are like very decentralized from an ownership standpoint of the asset because they sold it to like, a bunch of people. When you go and look at the newer ones, I'm telling. But by comparison, I have the data for this.
00:44:12.574 - 00:44:13.414, Speaker D: By comparison.
00:44:13.494 - 00:44:31.416, Speaker B: That's what I'm saying. By comparison. The irony, though, is to Gigabad, to protect investors, the SEC created a situation where like, two funds own 50% of major protocols now. So it's a very, like, again, it's the, the attempt to protect consumers actually, ultimately, in my view, harming them. But on let's.
00:44:31.520 - 00:44:34.724, Speaker D: Has Joe Lubin ever disclosed how much ethereum he owns.
00:44:35.504 - 00:44:36.968, Speaker B: I'm not aware of that. He has now.
00:44:37.016 - 00:44:41.576, Speaker D: I think that he has actually actively avoided answering that question many times.
00:44:41.760 - 00:44:48.396, Speaker B: Last year at consensus, our, my teammate Christine Kim really pinned him, and he. Yeah. He refused to answer. Yeah.
00:44:48.580 - 00:44:50.732, Speaker D: What are you guys excited for Christine for?
00:44:50.788 - 00:44:51.884, Speaker B: I know she pressed him.
00:44:51.924 - 00:44:53.396, Speaker D: She actually, like, went after that.
00:44:53.420 - 00:44:59.944, Speaker B: She did. She pressed him. What are you guys excited for? For the rest of Miami here and anything in particular or just.
00:45:01.044 - 00:45:05.264, Speaker D: It's just so nice to be in Miami. You just sweat it all out.
00:45:05.884 - 00:45:15.344, Speaker E: Hey, every morning, go for a run on the beach, maybe get a quick lift in, jump in the ocean, have a coffee, have an american spirit. It's really not such a bad life.
00:45:15.464 - 00:45:20.824, Speaker D: But honestly, one of the reasons why I take exception to the. The bitcoin maxi narrative.
00:45:20.864 - 00:45:21.104, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:21.144 - 00:45:24.640, Speaker D: Is I like being here. I like being around other bitcoiners.
00:45:24.672 - 00:45:25.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:25.072 - 00:45:33.680, Speaker D: It's a great community, it's a great culture, and it's, like, very badly, like, represented with this narrative.
00:45:33.752 - 00:45:39.266, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. You mean. You mean against the, like, maligning of bitcoin Max? This big, bad thing?
00:45:39.330 - 00:45:40.098, Speaker C: They're just people.
00:45:40.186 - 00:45:40.634, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
00:45:40.674 - 00:45:52.282, Speaker D: People that are into a thing and, yeah, they're excited to be here, and it's fun to be around people that are passionate and excited to be around other people that are passionate about this stuff. Conference pub key, bitcoin park, bitcoin commons.
00:45:52.338 - 00:45:53.706, Speaker B: Like this. These are awesome.
00:45:53.810 - 00:45:56.850, Speaker D: Third places are important third places, I learned.
00:45:57.042 - 00:46:27.886, Speaker E: But, I mean, so I'd say as someone who identifies as a bitcoin maximist, I also think that part of the thing, you know, it's like, this pantomime, don't, oh, maxis are so toxic. And, you know, the thing is, like, there are some people who are clearly the inspiration for that meme. And, you know, clearly, you know, there's, like, a short list of folks when someone says toxic, bitcoin max list. And there's, you know, like, a certain short list of folks that come to mind. But some of these guys were intellectual giants for bitcoin. You think about, like, Pierre writing the siren song of Crypto VC and, like, was it 2015?
00:46:27.990 - 00:46:28.406, Speaker B: Yep.
00:46:28.470 - 00:46:59.484, Speaker E: Like, you know, the. The. The bitcoin maximalists, I think, are intellectual juggernauts and deserve, like, respect and reverence and, like, really just contributed so much to the discourse. And so much of the stuff that was written in, like, you know, the early days or before I got into bitcoin is still just evergreen content. And, you know, I'm always sympathetic to the view that, like, I've noticed this during NFT NYC. Anytime you talk to a shit corner, it's clear that they don't really, like, you ask, why does your choice token need to exist? And it's clear they don't really understand bitcoin. And they don't really understand, like, what even, like, they're doing.
00:46:59.484 - 00:47:16.012, Speaker E: And I think also part of it too is just this weird form of memetic desire where it's like, I missed the boat and bitcoin. So I want to be part of the trendy new thing that's gonna be the next bitcoin. And it's just like, yeah, exactly. It's just like, you know, chill the fuck out. Stop being so insecure. Just realize that bitcoins larger than you and. Yeah, so I'm.
00:47:16.012 - 00:47:25.896, Speaker E: I agree with Thomas. I love spending time with bitcoin is down here in Miami. I'm gonna plug my panel, bitcoins energy tomorrow at 01:30 p.m. On the mining stage with Jeff Booth and Steve Barber.
00:47:25.960 - 00:47:34.324, Speaker B: Just to be clear, it will have already happened by the time anyone listens to this podcast. So let's just go ahead and congratulate you for a great panel. That was a great job.
00:47:36.064 - 00:47:36.680, Speaker E: I try.
00:47:36.752 - 00:47:43.392, Speaker B: I can't wait to see that. That's 130. You said 136. Dude. RFK was here earlier. RFK Junior. He was incredible for our audience.
00:47:43.392 - 00:47:52.848, Speaker B: If you like bitcoin and you need to. To. You're wondering which politicians are running that have good stuff to say about bitcoin. Robert F. Kennedy Junior is someone you should look at.
00:47:52.936 - 00:47:54.224, Speaker D: Oh, Beck is here as well.
00:47:54.304 - 00:47:55.084, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:47:56.664 - 00:48:28.000, Speaker A: That interview could have gone on and on. I think we were hanging out in that bus for like 2 hours. But for the sake of our listeners, we've edited it down a little bit. But thank you to Thomas and Drew for that awesome time on the pub key bus at Bitcoin 2023 Miami. Hey, thank you to the organizers of that conference, Bitcoin magazine. I think it was my favorite one yet. I've been going to these conferences since Bitcoin 2019 in San Francisco and really looking forward to bitcoin 2024 next summer in Nashville, as always.
00:48:28.000 - 00:48:46.002, Speaker A: Also, thank you to our good friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading for his insights on markets of macro. Hey, and we're going to play you out with a clip from me on the main stage at Bitcoin 2023 talking about credit and lending markets in bitcoin. And after that clip, hey, thanks for listening to Galaxy brains. We will see you next week I.
00:48:46.018 - 00:49:18.514, Speaker B: Want to hand this over to Alex. Alex with Blockfi. And then you can cover some other companies as well. With Blockfi, was this negligence just a business mistake or something more insidious? I think not just blockfi, but at several of these lenders, there were egregious lacks of risk management. Risk management not actually even being done, not only being bad at it. In fact, I would go so far as to say at some of these shops, perhaps bordering on criminal negligence.
00:49:20.614 - 00:49:20.974, Speaker A: You.
00:49:21.014 - 00:49:41.146, Speaker B: Absolutely can manage asset liability matching. You can manage maturity and duration risk. It is not a foregone conclusion that a lending book is going to blow up. Right? In fact, that rarely happens if adults are managing risk. But if we look across the space, what do we see? We see blockfi dead, Celsius dead. Genesis dead.
00:49:41.210 - 00:49:42.058, Speaker A: All of these firms.
00:49:42.106 - 00:50:10.526, Speaker B: And we could talk specifics, but I think it's, you know, if you just read crypto news, you know, a lot of them egregiously used, like, customer deposits in ways that were not supposed to be used. Like, give us an example of. So they're using customer deposits and they're not just lending it out. What were they doing with it? Yeah, I mean, in some cases, they were operating like hedge funds. They were investing the deposits. They were doing stuff on chain Celsius, pretty famous. Came out in their bankruptcy.
00:50:10.526 - 00:50:43.274, Speaker B: They'd given like a billion dollars to a Defi trader to just trade in DeFi, that isn't lending, that's not managing a lending book, that's running a hedge fund. And that isn't what most of them told their clients they were going to be doing. But what we do in lending is you have over collateralized loans, you have credit worthy counterparties, you manage the assets directly. It's like having a short locate in equities. You know exactly the asset you owe the borrower and you know how to get it, and you have the funds to get it, or you hold it, right? You don't like, ooh, maybe there's a pile of money.
00:50:43.314 - 00:50:44.682, Speaker A: If we need it, we'll go find.
00:50:44.818 - 00:50:50.214, Speaker B: Something to pay them out. And that's what some of these companies did. It's just they were not adults in the room.
