00:00:00.240 - 00:00:32.624, Speaker A: It has been a little bit of time. It's been two weeks since I did one of these solo episodes, and a lot has happened, not only when it comes to Ethereum core protocol development, but also some very important regulatory updates, at least for many people in the US, for ETH, the native currency of Ethereum. So we are going to be diving into some of these updates. I'm very excited to be back and and doing this show again, or this version of the infinite Jungle episodes.
