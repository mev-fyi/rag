00:00:07.880 - 00:00:11.446, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, bimnet, great to see you.
00:00:11.510 - 00:00:12.870, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. How you doing?
00:00:12.942 - 00:00:13.246, Speaker C: I'm good.
00:00:13.270 - 00:00:14.118, Speaker A: How are you doing?
00:00:14.286 - 00:00:16.542, Speaker B: Hanging in there. It's the middle of August, you know.
00:00:16.598 - 00:00:28.526, Speaker A: That's what I was gonna say. Like, well, we've had a little bit of excitement, finally. We did, but it has. Overall, it feels like a long summer. Pretty. There's been lots of doldrums. I'm not sure what a doldrum is, but it's been.
00:00:28.526 - 00:00:30.974, Speaker A: But we had some volatility.
00:00:31.094 - 00:00:31.994, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:00:32.534 - 00:00:35.366, Speaker A: Sort of. Right after we recorded last Thursday.
00:00:35.550 - 00:01:08.850, Speaker B: It was ironic because we were talking about how volatility was low, and I was saying that it seemed reasonably justified. Obviously, that was wrong. But what we saw happen last week was a deterioration of market conditions in terms of liquidity, forced stopouts in the middle of August. And so you had a pretty aggressive move lower down to. It happened at, like, in the afternoon.
00:01:08.962 - 00:01:09.258, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:09.306 - 00:01:11.514, Speaker B: When, like, not many desks were on.
00:01:11.594 - 00:01:14.694, Speaker A: Yeah, it was like four to 06:00 p.m. Or something on Thursday night.
00:01:15.034 - 00:01:21.218, Speaker B: And there's, you know, lots of force liquidations into, you know, no liquidity. Basically. I think that's why we had that big move.
00:01:21.306 - 00:01:27.920, Speaker A: Yeah. I think we saw the largest and just been bitcoin. Specifically, the largest bitcoin liquidation event since FTX.
00:01:28.042 - 00:02:07.464, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is on the magnitude of FTX, three arrows. So this was a very large liquidation event. Generally speaking, my approach to large liquidation events is they're normally good opportunities to fade the trend. Basically, all of the forced selling has had to happen, or most of it. And most of the time, if you're on the other side of that trade, it tends to perform well, just because people are just so scared at that time. And so if you can manage that anxiety, it's typically a good time to own assets, particularly alts.
00:02:07.464 - 00:02:24.252, Speaker B: Alts tend to have the most exacerbated moves. And so in the liquid, alts in particular, you tend to get very aggressive bounces when they happen, just from a percentage standpoint, because of things we've spoken about before. Basic facts.
00:02:24.388 - 00:02:29.460, Speaker A: Lower liquidity. I loved how he said, manage the anxiety. Is that, like, a large part of a trader's job?
00:02:29.492 - 00:02:35.396, Speaker B: Is that, like, it's like, 95% of it or not? 95%. Yeah, I know, obviously.
00:02:35.580 - 00:02:36.356, Speaker A: So.
00:02:36.540 - 00:02:36.980, Speaker B: But.
00:02:37.052 - 00:02:47.700, Speaker A: And then the movie, people were asking why, right. And there were some weird headlines, but none of them really lined up. And to me, it felt just like we've had a deterioration of the broader investing landscape globally.
00:02:47.732 - 00:02:48.460, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:02:48.532 - 00:02:53.216, Speaker A: Yeah. What context would you put this? We'll call it the bitcoin crash that happened last week.
00:02:53.240 - 00:02:59.536, Speaker B: But I think broader markets were generally selling off pretty aggressively.
00:02:59.680 - 00:03:01.296, Speaker A: Couple weeks, even a couple of weeks.
00:03:01.440 - 00:03:29.864, Speaker B: Two, three weeks, it was asian equities. Because of the chinese deterioration, the bond market was selling off very aggressively, particularly in the backend. Everywhere. Nasdaq reacted, S and P reacted, euro stocks reacted. Hang there was a global risk off move that occurred over the past couple of weeks. And we spoke about it last week. Higher us rates, lower bond prices, lower equities, and a stronger dollar.
00:03:29.864 - 00:03:36.328, Speaker B: These are all things symptomatic of a risk off move. And bitcoin was holding up okay.
00:03:36.376 - 00:03:36.752, Speaker A: That's what I mean.
00:03:36.768 - 00:03:37.984, Speaker B: It was coming into it. It was strange.
00:03:38.024 - 00:03:48.264, Speaker A: It was kind of like one of the last dominoes to fall. Usually crypto is one of the first, I feel like in a risk off. Yeah, it held up for weeks at 29. It was just sitting there at 29.
00:03:48.384 - 00:04:20.666, Speaker B: No, I mean, it just eventually, I think anecdotally, it seemed like you had a reasonable amount of positioning left in crypto and you're not close to year end, et cetera. But if you're a crypto fund, there's not really a compelling reason to be long aggressively at the moment. And we spoke about it. It's really like bitcoin is going to move on the ETF stuff once the ETF is actually like in the market and the flows can actually happen.
00:04:20.730 - 00:04:21.314, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:04:21.394 - 00:04:30.194, Speaker B: In terms of like how high bitcoin can get to on just the hype of the ETF, we reached that pinnacle. I think we did already, which was 31. 31 five.
00:04:30.274 - 00:04:30.970, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:31.162 - 00:04:38.530, Speaker B: And, you know, that's kind of your bar. And in terms of like known buyers in the market right now, it's very few.
00:04:38.602 - 00:04:38.882, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:38.938 - 00:04:46.180, Speaker B: It's microstrategy that has that, you know, the publicly announced ongoing bitcoin program.
00:04:46.372 - 00:04:47.108, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:47.276 - 00:04:48.788, Speaker A: Other retail aggregators.
00:04:48.916 - 00:04:50.412, Speaker B: Retail aggregate and then tether.
00:04:50.508 - 00:04:52.284, Speaker C: Right. Yeah.
00:04:52.364 - 00:04:55.780, Speaker A: There's a wallet that's been like quarterly buying or whatever.
00:04:55.852 - 00:04:56.464, Speaker B: Correct.
00:04:56.804 - 00:04:57.116, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:57.140 - 00:05:23.694, Speaker A: It's not that much, I agree. And the narrative catalysts are pretty dry here. We got like some court cases to pay attention to. We keep the grayscale thing is so funny because everyone was like convinced that this, including, I should say I wasn't convinced, but I was also part of this analysis of following the grayscale ruling as very likely to come out in August. But now it's so late in August that it's like maybe it isn't August, maybe it's months from now. It could be. And even then, that's a weak catalyst, a grayscale victory.
00:05:23.694 - 00:05:52.984, Speaker A: Doesn't actually mean that doesn't really mean that much in the scheme of things. So you're looking out at a landscape, narrative landscape that's pretty dry, I don't want to say bleak, but pretty dry of catalysts at the moment. I will say you start to approach the halving we are starting to get into. I think in a couple months it'll be reasonable to start thinking about the halving's impact on bitcoin prices and cycles. But even that, really, you shouldn't be. Historically speaking, eight months out isn't like a major time. So, yeah, it's doldrums.
00:05:52.984 - 00:05:54.024, Speaker A: It's a little bit of doldrums.
00:05:54.104 - 00:06:42.178, Speaker B: It's doldrums. And I think when you're in a world where there aren't too many crypto specific catalysts, I do tend to think that crypto follows the broader market as a whole. And so my outlook for the broader market is very rates oriented. And I still am of the view that your risks are that inflation is, there's the risk of reinflation, commodity prices might start to move higher. The US consumer is still strong and data is generally holding up. Okay, like imagine the US economy right now can handle mortgage rates that are like seven, 8% just fine. We just had like new home sales print 4% higher month on month.
00:06:42.226 - 00:06:42.634, Speaker A: That's wild.
00:06:42.674 - 00:06:43.682, Speaker B: And beat expectations.
00:06:43.738 - 00:06:45.666, Speaker A: Who's buying these homes at those rates?
00:06:45.770 - 00:06:47.866, Speaker B: Well, I mean, a ton of people.
00:06:47.930 - 00:06:49.866, Speaker A: I think it's a lot. We were talking about a lot of cash buyers.
00:06:49.930 - 00:06:56.726, Speaker B: Cash buyers, absolutely. And it's just demographically a new family.
00:06:56.870 - 00:06:57.150, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:57.182 - 00:07:01.966, Speaker B: They still need a home. They got to upgrade from an apartment. Well, fair enough. I don't know.
00:07:02.110 - 00:07:07.534, Speaker A: Yeah, but yes, I'm saying you're right. That is a strong number. That 4% is a strong number.
00:07:07.614 - 00:07:14.302, Speaker B: It's super strong. And what you have to realize is that there's so many things that get impacted from a robust housing market.
00:07:14.398 - 00:07:14.654, Speaker C: Right?
00:07:14.694 - 00:07:18.110, Speaker B: Like you buy a home, you need a plumber, electrician, construction.
00:07:18.182 - 00:07:18.390, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:18.422 - 00:07:22.694, Speaker B: Commodity rhythm, the state and locality that gets the taxes from, from the home.
00:07:22.814 - 00:07:23.070, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:23.102 - 00:07:32.862, Speaker B: There's just such a multiplier to the housing industry and it's still super strong. And the story is simple. Nobody, like the supply is tight because nobody wants to get out of their.
00:07:32.918 - 00:07:34.294, Speaker A: Low mortgage, scarce asset.
00:07:34.374 - 00:07:37.734, Speaker B: Right. And there's still buyers.
00:07:37.814 - 00:07:38.342, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:38.478 - 00:07:39.550, Speaker B: And people still have a job.
00:07:39.582 - 00:07:39.798, Speaker C: Three.
00:07:39.846 - 00:07:43.634, Speaker A: So theoretically, what I mean, the basics are pretty simple until there are not buyers.
00:07:44.214 - 00:07:44.598, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:44.646 - 00:07:46.958, Speaker A: Or people become for sellers, or there's more supply.
00:07:47.046 - 00:07:47.246, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:47.270 - 00:07:59.316, Speaker A: If they become for sellers or if the rest of the economy breaks down, people get unemployed off and stuff. They need to move to a cheaper home. Then you see a supply influx and. But I mean, like, that's objectively not happening right now.
00:07:59.340 - 00:07:59.708, Speaker B: That's not.
00:07:59.756 - 00:08:01.516, Speaker A: So we still have that strength.
00:08:01.700 - 00:08:23.438, Speaker B: And so that's why I think the US economy can handle higher interest rates. And this week we're actually going into Jackson Hole, which is happening. And the discussion is, part of the discussion at least, is around neutral. What is the definition of r star neutral interest rates? Where is the baseline for the US going forward?
00:08:23.486 - 00:08:25.518, Speaker A: Krugman finally came out and said, I.
00:08:25.526 - 00:08:26.654, Speaker B: Don'T believe that in Krugman.
00:08:26.734 - 00:08:32.006, Speaker A: I don't either, but he came out and said the Fed should target 3% instead of 2%.
00:08:32.190 - 00:08:35.954, Speaker B: That's actually very interesting given that he's a little more.
00:08:36.454 - 00:08:39.670, Speaker A: He's on the closer on the doves kind of side.
00:08:39.742 - 00:08:39.974, Speaker C: Correct.
00:08:40.014 - 00:08:44.022, Speaker A: More dovish. Yeah, that people are joking.
00:08:44.038 - 00:08:44.158, Speaker C: Wow.
00:08:44.166 - 00:08:47.068, Speaker A: It's a 1% increase. No, dude, that's a 50% increase in the target.
00:08:47.166 - 00:08:48.440, Speaker B: Some people are pointing out.
00:08:48.512 - 00:08:49.768, Speaker A: Yeah, that.
00:08:49.856 - 00:08:50.968, Speaker B: But that's a big deal.
00:08:51.056 - 00:09:04.280, Speaker A: That is a big deal if they. Well, not so much that Krugman specifically is saying. And although he is influential, he's a New York Times columnist, he's got a large audience. But that would be a big deal if they did change the target. But we've talked about this before. Do you think. Let's say they change.
00:09:04.280 - 00:09:12.960, Speaker A: Would they ever even say they've changed? They would never say that because they would immediately get more inflation. Right. They can't admit it even if they kind of do. Soft target three.
00:09:13.032 - 00:09:33.854, Speaker B: No, it's a very hard thing to change, especially given that decades of monetary policy have been based on an r star, around 2%. And that's the construct of academia, et cetera, right now is around 2%. And it's not just the same for the US. We're talking Europe, pretty global.
00:09:34.274 - 00:09:39.370, Speaker A: That's basically the global consensus. Decent amount of inflation. It's not too much, but it's good enough to.
00:09:39.402 - 00:10:12.820, Speaker B: Not too hot, not too cold, and so just. Right. Yeah, basically. So it makes things challenging for them. But communication is such a tough thing for them because they have to worry about their credibility at the same time. But all in all, what I think it highlights is a level of uncertainty around inflation and rates that is really unprecedented. And that makes owning assets, particularly long duration assets that have exposure to this variability in inflation and policy.
00:10:12.820 - 00:10:27.740, Speaker B: Much tougher, right? Because if expectations for neutral are moving around, expectations for inflation moving around like this, it's just really tough to stomach, especially if you're in a 20 year bond. Which is why my favorite trade still is curved. Steeper.
00:10:27.812 - 00:10:28.276, Speaker C: Yep.
00:10:28.380 - 00:10:32.044, Speaker A: Vimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading, my friend, thank you so much. Pleasure.
