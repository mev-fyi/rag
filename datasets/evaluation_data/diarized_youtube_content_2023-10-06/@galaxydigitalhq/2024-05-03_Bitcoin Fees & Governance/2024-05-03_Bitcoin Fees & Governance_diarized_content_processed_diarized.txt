00:00:00.160 - 00:00:16.286, Speaker A: I think it is really worth noting that he did not invent VRC 20. Somebody did that on top of inscriptions. Inscriptions were not designed for that. They were designed in his own words. He came on this podcast and explained this too for classic nfts. Basically images, artwork, stuff like that. Documents? Yes.
00:00:16.286 - 00:00:45.434, Speaker A: You want to preserve a famous speech or a censored work. I can respect that. I'm ambivalent. We won't go all the way into the inscription thing. I think it's quite elegant what he's done with runes. It does follow the it uses opereturn, which was designed specifically for this type of purpose, or the bite size limit there was limited to allow but limit its use for things like this. Omni, the tether protocol used to use opereturn for this purpose.
00:00:45.434 - 00:00:56.574, Speaker A: And in that way it's kind of a. People give them a lot of crap because the main thing people are doing with these is creating worthless altcoins. Worthless, really? Even meme coins? Truly no utility.
