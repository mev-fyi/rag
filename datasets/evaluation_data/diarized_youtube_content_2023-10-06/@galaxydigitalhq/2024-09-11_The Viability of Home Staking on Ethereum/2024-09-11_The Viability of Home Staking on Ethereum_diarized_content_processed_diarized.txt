Even today, with liquid staking solutions, home stakers are missing out on a lot. You are locking up your 32 ETH. You don't get to have a liquid token representation for it, which many, many other stakers do. You are operating your own machinery, which requires quite a bit of technical skills, not only because Ethereum upgrades so much, but there's so many pieces of software that you to be running. The execution layer client, the condensed layer client, the engine API. There's a variety of clients to choose from, all of which have their own strengths and benefits and different requirements when it comes to being able to operate them proficiently.
