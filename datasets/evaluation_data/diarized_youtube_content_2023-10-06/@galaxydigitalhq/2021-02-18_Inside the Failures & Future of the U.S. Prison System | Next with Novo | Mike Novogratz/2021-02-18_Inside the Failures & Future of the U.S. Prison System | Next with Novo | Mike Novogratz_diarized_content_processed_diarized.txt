00:00:00.440 - 00:00:35.276, Speaker A: I'm Mike Novogratz, and this is next with Novo. Today we're starting with Alex Duran, not related to Roberto Duran or Duran Duran, but Alex Duran, who actually works at Galaxy gives, our philanthropy organization. And he's got a pretty fantastic story, a story of really second chances. And, you know, criminal justice is a big part of our work here in my life, and there's no better example that I've met to date than Alex. And so, Alex, thanks for being on the show.
00:00:35.380 - 00:00:39.276, Speaker B: Thank you for having me, Mike. And congratulations on launching the podcast.
00:00:39.380 - 00:00:39.732, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:00:39.748 - 00:00:40.820, Speaker B: It's an honor to be here.
00:00:40.972 - 00:00:44.224, Speaker A: Hey, so why don't you just start by giving us your story?
00:00:47.284 - 00:01:38.324, Speaker B: So I was raised in the university Heights section of the Bronx. I was born there in eighties era reaganomics, and, you know, my neighborhood was systematically disinvested in. So my parents immigrated from the Dominican Republic to the United States in 1980. And I was born, actually, in Washington Heights and moved as a toddler to the Bronx. And, you know, my parents sent me to school thinking that America was the promised land. And I remember early on in one of our dinner conversations that my father told my older sister, hey, close your mouth. Don't they teach you any education in school? Like, his frame of mind was like of a boarding school that slapped you with a ruler and told you how to behave.
00:01:38.324 - 00:01:44.860, Speaker B: All the things that I was learning in public school system was kind of contrary to that.
00:01:45.032 - 00:02:10.864, Speaker A: So one of the things I've learned to think about and try to talk about or experiences this idea of proximity. Bryan Stevenson always says, you don't really understand a neighborhood unless you have proximity. And so a lot of people have no idea what the Bronx is like, or the Bronx back then is like, so try to give us a little proximity, a metaphoric journey to some proximity. Like, how tough is a tough neighborhood? Like, explain what was growing up like.
00:02:11.604 - 00:02:46.448, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, one thing that I want to emphasize is most of the people in my neighborhood were working class folks. The majority of them were trying to work a nine to five jobs, and they were struggling. They were just trying to get bad and trying to put food on the table for their family. In the neighborhood that I grew up, yes, I had to sidestep crack vials in the morning and wash off with gunshots at night. But there was also a lot of love and a lot of community caring. And that neighborhood shaped me into the person that I am today.
00:02:46.616 - 00:02:50.560, Speaker A: So crack vials in the morning, was that a regular thing or was that.
00:02:50.632 - 00:03:02.448, Speaker B: Sure. I mean, in the 1980s, that was a regular thing that was all over the hallways, front of the building, walking to school. That was a constant. The back of the school, you saw it.
00:03:02.536 - 00:03:05.874, Speaker A: How old were you the first time you knew someone who died?
00:03:06.534 - 00:03:37.668, Speaker B: I mean, I saw neighbors in front of the building using drugs, sometimes sleeping on the floor of my second floor apartment. They were all around my building, drug addicts. And you would just hear that someone had passed away or disappear into the prison system. Those were two of the things that the elders used to say, like, drugs will only lead to prison or death.
00:03:37.836 - 00:03:44.904, Speaker A: And when you were middle school, you're 1314 years old. Were you still going to school?
00:03:45.324 - 00:04:14.744, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I dropped out of high school when I was a sophomore, but I was still going to school. I was still, you know, I wasn't a great student, but I remember that, you know, the teacher putting her leg up in the desk and just, like, given up on us. And that was something that you probably didn't see in your school, Mike, where the teachers were more competent and caring and actually took a real compassionate sense of duty to the job.
00:04:15.804 - 00:04:29.194, Speaker A: And so you drop out of school, you're a sophomore, you're 15 years old, and you dropped out. Cause you were just, eh. Enough or just didn't care. Running with the wrong crowd. How do you. How does a 15 year old drop out of school?
00:04:29.574 - 00:04:56.432, Speaker B: It was some of that, but I thought that I had a better life in stocking groceries at the local supermarket. And that was my first job. I was coming out of high school. I had a job from three to 903:00 in the afternoon and 09:00 at night. And I had some money in my pocket, and that felt good. I felt that my choices were. Were better in just working than going to school.
00:04:56.608 - 00:04:59.844, Speaker A: And your mom and dad, they were happy that you were working?
00:05:01.344 - 00:05:14.440, Speaker B: My dad sort of took the tack that, you know, it's better for you to, you know, if you. If you're not gonna go to school, you better work. My mom wanted me to complete high school, but she. I don't think she understood all the challenges that I was going through in school.
00:05:14.592 - 00:05:16.216, Speaker A: How did you get yourself in trouble?
00:05:16.400 - 00:06:10.658, Speaker B: So even though I was working legitimately in the supermarket, I was still hanging out with guys from my block and my neighborhood, and we ran as a crew. And, you know, one day I was involved in a shootout in the Bronx where someone unfortunately lost their lives. And it was me and my co defendant who got arrested for it. Even though I wasn't the shooter that pulled the trigger that killed Dennis Hernandez. On that day I was there, I knew something was gonna happen. I didn't think my court offender was gonna kill Mister Hernandez. But New York's laws say that if you're acting in constant with someone, you're just as guilty as them.
00:06:10.706 - 00:06:12.058, Speaker A: So felony murder laws?
00:06:12.146 - 00:06:12.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:14.114 - 00:06:15.976, Speaker A: Do those laws still exist in New York?
00:06:16.130 - 00:06:31.636, Speaker B: They do. They acted in concert for sure. And, you know, but I was also living the street culture where, like, snitching wasn't an option. The prosecutor did over me three and a half years to testify against my co defendant, and I turned that down.
00:06:31.740 - 00:06:34.064, Speaker A: So you turned down three and a half years and you end up getting.
00:06:35.164 - 00:06:39.504, Speaker B: I copped out. Took a plea of 14 years in prison.
00:06:40.804 - 00:06:43.064, Speaker A: So what goes to us since you were 17?
00:06:43.774 - 00:06:45.862, Speaker B: I was 20, actually, 20 at the time.
00:06:45.998 - 00:06:57.354, Speaker A: So what goes to a 20 year old's head to say, I'll take 14 years versus three and a half to protect your buddy that was actually gonna go to jail anyways?
00:06:58.014 - 00:07:23.154, Speaker B: Yeah, Mikey. I mean, one thing you gotta understand when you're sort of steeped into that culture of the streets, and plus, I had 29 months in Rikers island waiting for my case to be adjudicated. So even, you know, had I been home, right. If I. If I would have gotten bail. Right, something that you're working on, um, the foundation is working on, um, I probably would have made a different decision, but I was so steeped in the culture of prison.
00:07:23.454 - 00:07:28.526, Speaker A: And you were already 29 months in Rikers before you were found guilty?
00:07:28.670 - 00:07:29.510, Speaker B: That's correct.
00:07:29.622 - 00:07:39.606, Speaker A: 29 months, yes. And you had a court appointed attorney from the Bronx. Defenders or legal aid. Where was your. I had you hire your own attorney?
00:07:39.670 - 00:07:57.302, Speaker B: No, I wish I had a, what they call it a team b, which is a lawyer, that it's not necessarily working for the city. They have the own law firm, but it hires the city, hires all these attorney to kind of line up the load.
00:07:57.478 - 00:08:07.482, Speaker A: Other cases, 29 months at Rikers even before you were found guilty. That's crazy. Talk about Rikers.
00:08:07.498 - 00:08:39.404, Speaker B: A little bit Rikers. It's a doggy dog world. Getting into a lot of fights for the phone, for the food, having a lot of trouble with the guards. There's really nothing to do there. It's a place where, you know, there's. There's no opportunity for rehabilitation. Most of the folks incarcerated, they are not thinking about bettering themselves, but rather getting out of prison.
00:08:39.404 - 00:08:52.680, Speaker B: You know, the. The sort of miasma of Rikers island is such that, you know, it's an environment that breeds violence and nothing productive comes out of it.
00:08:52.712 - 00:09:08.668, Speaker A: It was interesting. We went and visited last year. I talked to a bunch of guys. One guy was giant, big, beautiful guy. He'd been an all star football player. And then he went on a scholarship, and he got hurt and got into trouble. But he was probably six, 8250 of muscle.
00:09:08.668 - 00:09:25.778, Speaker A: And I said, well, it's good to be bigger. He said, no, no, no. Everyone wants to take the big guy out. And I was like, even 2019? He was like, oh, yeah. All the guys had that fight or flight sense to them that I met. I mean, I only met ten people, probably. So by no means was it exhaustive.
00:09:25.778 - 00:09:27.546, Speaker A: And so that was your. That was your experience?
00:09:27.650 - 00:10:02.838, Speaker B: Yes. An environment that is really meant to break you and deteriorate you mentally. You know, when I was in Rikers island, our country was going to war with Iraq. And I kept on thinking, you know, 20 years old, you know, my. My life seemingly was over, and I just hoped that I had the opportunity to go to war and, like, die for a cause that was better than the one I was losing my life for, you know, that's what I was thinking. I was in solitary confinement. I used to wake up, and I was like, damn, I wish I would get sent to Iraq right now.
00:10:02.926 - 00:10:04.798, Speaker A: So you had solitary at Rikers?
00:10:04.886 - 00:10:05.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:05.214 - 00:10:05.982, Speaker A: That was your first time?
00:10:06.038 - 00:10:08.102, Speaker B: Yeah. The central punitive segregation unit.
00:10:08.198 - 00:10:11.526, Speaker A: And that was because you punched someone? Like, how did you get solitary?
00:10:11.710 - 00:11:01.734, Speaker B: My first time I went to solitary confinement was for 90 days for a fight over the phone. There were slot times, half an hour calls, 21 minutes for one call and then six minutes, and actually, no total, 21 minutes, 15 minutes call and then a six minute call. And my son's mother, at the time, when I got arrested, my son was five months old. She used to work at a Duane Reed pharmacy and used to come out of work late at night. So I used to have to call her, like, around 09:00 at night. And those who got on the phone around that time had to be the toughest, because as the later it got to, like, locking in, the harder was for someone to get on the phone. That was sort of the culture of Rikers island.
00:11:04.554 - 00:11:08.226, Speaker A: You're found guilty, you're sent up to.
00:11:08.250 - 00:11:27.964, Speaker B: Where you first go to the reception and classification center, which is in downstate. It's called downstate correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York. And then from there, you get shipped to different facilities. I went to sing Sing first. Lasted a couple of months there, and then up to five points correctional facility in central New York.
00:11:28.504 - 00:12:07.604, Speaker A: And so, you know, I have this idea, and I think there's a kind of a nationwide movement on this criminal justice reform. And the thought is we've got this really punitive, degradating system, and that makes absolutely no sense. Most people come out worse than they went in. Less a chance to be a taxpaying citizen, less a chance to be a loving father. You somehow came out the other end healed, smarter, more intuitive, this beautiful human being. And so what happened? How did that happen?
00:12:08.904 - 00:13:20.524, Speaker B: Well, you know, part of it was, you know, deep introspection and kind of in spite of that, like, very violent environment, kind of going on a journey to try to, like, figure out, like, how did I end up here? I did a lot of reading. I started off, I'm not religious, but I started off reading the Bible a lot and reading a lot of books. Kind of went on an auto didactic journey and to try to try to understand myself a little bit better. But I think the turning point for me was getting into the bar College prison initiative program and getting a high quality liberal arts education while still in prison. And that really made all the difference to me. College prison programs were decimated because of the 1994 crime bill all across the country. But college and prison programs help people to, you know, not only sort of understand yourself a little better, you know, when you're reading like Plato and Socrates and all of these philosophers, you know, it teaches you a lot about life.
00:13:20.984 - 00:14:02.694, Speaker A: Yeah. For those that don't know, you know, Pell grants, loans, and grants for prisoners to take college were canceled, which makes absolutely no sense. We've been trying to fight to get those back. I tell you, one little vignette. I visited the Bard prison program, bard prison initiative at Fishkill up in New York. And of anything I've seen in the world in the last four years, it was the most transformative. I sat for 2 hours with probably eight to ten, I'd say 25 to 40 year old men who had thrown themselves into this program, into their studying and the scholarship.
00:14:02.694 - 00:14:53.326, Speaker A: And if I had closed my eyes, I would have been like, this could be at Oxford in their PhD program. The level of scholarship was so intense and so high. And I was thinking when I went there, I was like, it'll probably be some crappy male in college. And I was like, dude, these guys would compete at Harvard, Princeton, Yale, anywhere they went. And for me, it was that moment of, you say you believe in second chances, but I was like, whoa, second chances. These guys have had a second chance in, gave themselves a second chance and have come out the other end completely transformed and then you look, the barred prison initiative has like, a 1% recidivism rate, right? It works. And so what's, what's special about that? Is it talk about Bard for a second and how.
00:14:53.326 - 00:15:05.354, Speaker A: Cause it wasn't just you that came out. I mean, 99% people going through it come out, get a job, lead a productive life. What do they do different than everyone else?
00:15:06.334 - 00:15:39.694, Speaker B: I think being equipped with some tools to sort of communicate your ideas, the ability to write well, you know, the ability to develop your critical thinking skills. I used to. When I started Bard, I remember I used to say a lot, no, the system did this to you. The system. And I remember sitting with one of my professor, and he was like, define that for me. What do you mean by that? Right. And I had to unpack a lot of things, right.
00:15:39.694 - 00:16:02.634, Speaker B: It gave me a language to sort of talk about how did I end up where I'm in now from the neighborhood that I grew up in to a prison in New York state? And like, that through line is that barred allowed me to sort of investigate and think deeply how I ended up in the place that I was in.
00:16:03.454 - 00:16:35.470, Speaker A: So one of my thoughts is that everyone who goes into prison is traumatized. They're traumatized in their youth. They're traumatized in the act of committing a crime. I mean, listen, everyone in the world is traumatized. But people go in prison, are especially traumatized. And so you're dealing with a whole community of people that are going through trauma, that have had experienced deep trauma and are continuing to experience trauma in prison. And so it sounds like Bard was part of your ability to process this trauma.
00:16:35.470 - 00:16:45.070, Speaker A: Did you see it that way, or did it just kind of naturally happen? Did you ever say, geez, I was traumatized, and now I'm processing it? Or was it a natural and you look back on it? Is that what happened, or am I just making that up?
00:16:45.182 - 00:17:43.908, Speaker B: No, I think that a liberal arts education allows you to, like, investigate and examine your own life. But at the same time, I think it's deeper than that. And I mean, to this day, I think I'm still not quite sure the entirety of that experience and how it has impacted me. A colleague of ours said recently to me, you know, you were sexually abused for twelve years, that you was in prison. And I was like, what? What are you talking about? And she said, yeah, what did you have to do? Every time you came off the visit? And I had to pause for a second. Cause she's right. Every time I go see my family in the visiting room, and I go back into the prison, I had to strip and bend over and spread my butt cheeks and show the guard.
00:17:43.908 - 00:18:07.844, Speaker B: Right. And that is the first time I did that. I was devastated. I felt violated. But over a period of time, that becomes normal, and it's not. So it's difficult to really understand, like, all of the impact that that has on a person's life.
00:18:08.744 - 00:18:40.374, Speaker A: Yeah. It was interesting when we visited prisons in Germany about two years ago and in Norway, and, you know, they have their own bathrooms in the prison cells. Like, they've got a right to privacy. The punishment happens when you lose your liberty. And after that, the whole system is set up to try to rehabilitate, have that citizen return as a productive member of society. And so you don't lose your right to privacy, you don't lose your right to vote, you lose your right to dignity. Quite frankly, it's the exact opposite.
00:18:40.374 - 00:18:49.100, Speaker A: And that's the one thing I've noticed, not that I'm an expert at us prisons or jails. It all feels like it's meant to strip you of your dignity.
00:18:49.172 - 00:18:50.044, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:18:50.204 - 00:18:55.980, Speaker A: You know, shitting in an open toilet in lots of places or, you know, strip searches.
00:18:56.172 - 00:19:42.664, Speaker B: From a purely business perspective, Mike, if you're looking at how much, recall, the prison is doing right. If the human beings were product, right. I will argue that prison system treats one as if they are, but over two thirds of people are being recalled back into that. You know, like, they're so you're putting out broken human beings every single year, and you're not, you know, you're not rehabilitating them. I think that we should, you know, do away with a system like that. Any business would have been already gone bankrupt. But no, we keep pumping more money into that system.
00:19:45.904 - 00:20:01.524, Speaker A: All right, so let's look forward a little bit. You made it out. You were well educated. You found some peace in understanding who you were. Talk about life post. You walked out the door when.
00:20:02.264 - 00:20:09.472, Speaker B: So I came home three weeks after the 2016 election, stepping into interesting world.
00:20:09.568 - 00:20:10.528, Speaker A: So four years ago.
00:20:10.616 - 00:20:46.004, Speaker B: Four years ago, yeah. And the dwindling sort of days of the Obama administration. But, you know, I had a. I had a. I had an interesting exchange before I left president that was with the president of the Ford Foundation, Darren Walker. And this is where being proximate is really key, because he came in there to have a conversation with me and some of my peers about how the bar college business initiative was going, which they were funding. And one thing that I hope they keep funding it.
00:20:46.004 - 00:21:07.844, Speaker B: One thing that I emphasized to him was that we're getting this great liberal arts degree from Bard, but it's not a panacea. We're still going to face many hurdles upon release. And I asked him, will you hire formerly incarcerated people at your foundation? And he did just that. And I think that that conversation is what led me to be sitting next to you now, Mike.
00:21:08.724 - 00:21:13.784, Speaker A: Interesting. So you got a job, you got a wife?
00:21:14.124 - 00:21:14.708, Speaker B: I do.
00:21:14.756 - 00:21:15.676, Speaker A: I got a house.
00:21:15.700 - 00:21:40.192, Speaker B: I recently married. I bought a condo in Stanford, Connecticut. I work for Galaxy Gibbs as a program officer, managing its criminal justice portfolio, doing the work of preventing someone from my neighborhood to go into prison, just like I did. That's the kind of work I'm doing now.
00:21:40.288 - 00:22:00.324, Speaker A: So let's think forward. Let's think bigger. You're 35, 35 years old. You've got a good 45 years ahead of you, productive years. You got a big iq. You've learned a ton. You've got a story and a narrative that gives you power.
00:22:00.324 - 00:22:12.018, Speaker A: It might not think it, but it does. Because anyone overcomes what you've overcome and come out the other side has power. What are you going to be when you grow up? I ask everyone that question, by the way.
00:22:12.066 - 00:22:57.284, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if I could leave this world and haven't made an impact on dismantling the carceral state and reducing the number of people in our prison system and just having a little bit of impact on that. I love your analogy of redirecting energy. If we could redirect our energy towards that and lessering human suffering and again, preventing a kid who had the curiosity and the potential to do something great with his life rather than going into the streets like I went to.
00:22:57.404 - 00:23:25.196, Speaker A: So let me ask you a question. This is. I've met a ton of people that have. Are returning citizens that all come back to work in the criminal justice reform space, you know, from Desmond Meade, who I love, to tons of them. And one reason has been other doors aren't opened. It's like, this is one of the few places that people can get a job. How do we change that mindset? No part of this is a mission.
00:23:25.196 - 00:23:56.004, Speaker A: You got a mission from God, as the Blues brothers would say. You lived it and you were like, okay, if I can help, that will give my life purpose. And so that's very noble. But is it also because you didn't think you were allowed to think outside of that space? Like, you could be a CEO or you've got all the talents to do anything you want to do? There's something endemic that we need to change to give people that come out an open mindedness that they can work, and it doesn't have to be in the criminal justice space.
00:23:56.904 - 00:24:39.894, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, part of it is preparing people for that. I wouldn't say that's only with people that have gone to prison. There's a lot of people that never been to prison are struggling that can get a job in certain industries. It has to do with our public education system, but certainly has to do with communities being targeted and criminalized. So I think there's a few systems of oppression that we got to look at, but our criminal justice system, for sure doesn't prepare you for a job other than maybe manual labor. So that's something that we definitely need to look at.
00:24:40.304 - 00:24:41.684, Speaker A: Are you optimistic?
00:24:42.944 - 00:25:05.084, Speaker B: I am. I have to be. You know, my son, who is 15 years old now and wants to play in the NBA one day, I have to think that I'm gonna leave in my better world than the one that I was confronted with.
00:25:05.444 - 00:25:07.540, Speaker A: How many books did you read when you were inside?
00:25:07.732 - 00:25:08.504, Speaker B: Wow.
00:25:09.244 - 00:25:10.212, Speaker A: Roughly.
00:25:10.388 - 00:25:12.024, Speaker B: Not quite sure I could put it.
00:25:13.084 - 00:25:20.104, Speaker A: Was that one weird silver lining that you had all the time in the world so you could read so much? Because, I tell you, very few people read hundreds of books.
00:25:20.484 - 00:25:43.772, Speaker B: I really think reading saved my life. Going back to that first time I landed in solitary confinement, I was next to this italian guy who. Who had a whole bunch of mafia books and left them to me when he left what we call the box, solitary confinement. I remember one of the first books I read was the murder machine, and.
00:25:43.788 - 00:25:46.584, Speaker A: It was just what you're supposed to read.
00:25:48.524 - 00:26:03.204, Speaker B: But. Yeah, but finding myself in characters that lived wildly different lives from me or some similar, I kind of pulled through in those dark days.
00:26:03.944 - 00:26:13.524, Speaker A: What was the most impactful book you read in your life if you had to give one book to your 15 year old son when he's 25? What's the book?
00:26:13.824 - 00:26:53.796, Speaker B: Wow. I will say Ralph Ellison's the Invisible Man. I think it's a perfect novel. If there was ever a perfect novel, was that, like, every sentence, every paragraph, it was just beautifully constructed, and it actually took me some time to get. The first time I tried to read it, I couldn't get into it. But the, you know, the second time I read, I was in barred, and I was just flummoxed by the beauty of Ralph Ellison's prose and, like, how much I saw myself in his main character.
00:26:53.980 - 00:26:57.944, Speaker A: Tell you, you're a great advertisement for a liberal arts education.
00:26:58.404 - 00:26:58.812, Speaker B: Really?
00:26:58.868 - 00:27:22.458, Speaker A: You know, Williams, Princeton, Wellesley. Those guys should recruit you just as a salesman for liberal arts. It's interesting. A lot of people go to school these days and they move into some more vocational tract. But now I have a real appreciation for learning how to think and read and write, communicate what you learn at liberal arts places.
00:27:22.506 - 00:27:53.974, Speaker B: I think it makes us better citizens. Part of the reason why we have so much misinformation right now is because we're not. We don't take the time to really inform ourselves. It's easier in the social media age to be outraged than informed. And we too readily look at headlines that we agree with and accept it as truth. And, in fact, it may be misinformation.
00:27:54.914 - 00:28:09.770, Speaker A: We just had a big election. What's going to happen in the next four years? And let me ask you another question. If you're a young 14 year old in the Bronx, does it matter? Like Obama, Bush, Trump, has anyone helped the 14 year olds in the Bronx?
00:28:09.962 - 00:28:16.548, Speaker B: Well, part of it is you're 14. You don't really care about those things. You want to be, you know, shoot.
00:28:16.596 - 00:28:18.700, Speaker A: But I'm just saying, the impact, the impact, the impact.
00:28:18.812 - 00:28:45.764, Speaker B: I think it does. I think that this election is gonna. It's gonna definitely change the trajectory a lot of people's lives. I was gonna say that Steve Emsky said that history doesn't really think about first a president who only served one term, one term presidents. And Trump is hopefully going to be a one term president unless he pulls Grover Cleveland on us.
00:28:46.864 - 00:28:49.448, Speaker A: Very few people would know that Grover Cleveland ran a second time.
00:28:49.536 - 00:29:23.888, Speaker B: Right, right. He's actually the 22nd and 24th president. I'm hoping that the history won't kind of see this as an aberration, but I also am, like, pellucid about the fact that, you know, Trump is just a symptom of where we at as a country. And, you know, it's going to take a lot of work to also dismantle white supremacy, patriarchy, and a lot of other systems of oppression that we're fighting to take down.
00:29:24.056 - 00:29:39.104, Speaker A: Excellent. All right, Alex, I want to thank you a lot. It's one of the things I've learned in life that there's plenty to learn all along the way, and it's not always from the. The professor or the CEO that you're going to learn things with. So I love his story. I love him.
00:29:40.084 - 00:29:42.852, Speaker B: Thank you, Mike. I was a little nervous. Must have made you.
00:29:42.868 - 00:29:57.444, Speaker A: Didn't seem it. You seem cool as a cat. We're going to be back at you soon. At one point with more next with Novo. Hopefully you bring in stories that matter, insights that matter, and people that you're fascinated with. So thank you.
