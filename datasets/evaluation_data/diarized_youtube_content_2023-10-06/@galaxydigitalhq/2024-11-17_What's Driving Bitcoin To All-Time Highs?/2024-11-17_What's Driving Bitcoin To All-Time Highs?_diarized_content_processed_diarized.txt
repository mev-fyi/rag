00:00:00.120 - 00:00:05.265, Speaker A: Bitcoin is trading at $92,720, according to the block clock.
00:00:05.345 - 00:00:06.241, Speaker B: Yeah, we've.
00:00:06.273 - 00:00:17.865, Speaker A: Hit almost 93. I think might have even hit 93. I mean, we are a stone's throw from $100,000 Bitcoin. What's driving the increase? Is a rhetorical question. But, yeah.
00:00:17.905 - 00:00:50.455, Speaker B: I mean, well, you know, I think a lot of it is based on expectations of a friendlier administration coming into power. On the back of that, we've seen tremendous inflows into the ETF products. We've also seen a pretty sizable pickup in leverage across all futures and perps exchanges. There's been consistent buy pressure in the US from large players.
