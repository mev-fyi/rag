00:00:00.360 - 00:00:55.105, Speaker A: With that in mind, I think that as you get closer to the election, I think you'll probably start to see crypto trade better, because part of the reason why cryptos come off is because of that Trump probability coming off. And so I do think that as you kind of approach the debates and the elections, you know, kind of that upside risk to crypto has to be part of the distribution curve for folks. And so, if you're thinking about a Trump presidency as being BTC over 100k as time approaches the election, and if we start to see Trump's probability going back to more of a coin toss, that should be positive for Bitcoin. In addition, I do think that being in a benign environment for risk assets, if you're not going to get these crazy 4% or 5% down days in the Nasdaq, and it's going to be that slow churn of earnings and buybacks.
