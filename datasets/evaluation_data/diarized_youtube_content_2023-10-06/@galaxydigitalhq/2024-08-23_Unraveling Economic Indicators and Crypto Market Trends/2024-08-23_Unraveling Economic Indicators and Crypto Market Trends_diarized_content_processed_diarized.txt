00:00:07.480 - 00:00:12.565, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Bimnet Abi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet, welcome back to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:12.865 - 00:00:14.097, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.241 - 00:00:40.971, Speaker A: It's, it's, it is summer doldrums, but there have been a couple exciting things. Let's start with this Bureau of Labor Statistics downward revision. It's the largest downward revision in employment numbers since the Great financial crisis 2009. This just hit this morning. We're recording on Wednesday, August 21st. What's your take on this? Was this expected? You've called out skepticism about the employment numbers in the past on this show.
00:00:41.083 - 00:01:13.099, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very interesting to see the market reaction to the number. So the number came out at, I think, 812,000 jobs that were in the reporting that shouldn't have been. And so that's a big number. And to give you guys some context, I think last on farm payrolls, we might have missed by like 100,000 jobs. And markets went crazy. And so this is a pretty material number, comes out to about 70,000 jobs per month.
00:01:13.193 - 00:01:17.571, Speaker A: And this is March 2023 to March 2024. Right.
00:01:17.733 - 00:01:59.935, Speaker B: I think it covers March, April. Right. Because the 12 months. But yeah, no, so it's a big deal. And I think if I told you today that or like a week ago that we actually have 800,000 fewer jobs, you'd be like, that's a good amount because we're normally adding like 200,000 jobs per month now. So that's literally like four months of healthy employment numbers just gone. And I think given the focus of the Fed in terms of their dual mandate and now kind of being more focused on the labor market, it's very material from the standpoint that it's a number that the Fed can't ignore.
00:01:59.935 - 00:02:44.445, Speaker B: And in fact, they're focusing on it. And so I genuinely think that the market reaction we've seen so far probably speaks to how expected this number was in terms of. There's a lot of forecasters on the street anticipating a number around this ballpark. In addition, it speaks to the magnitude of rate cuts that are already baked in. Going into this Release. You had four cuts in 2024. That's 100 basis points that was expected, you know, going through year end and then, you know, over the next, like, you know, six to 10 months, like you had another 100 basis points.
00:02:44.445 - 00:03:25.767, Speaker B: So there's a lot of cutting baked into the market. And so it's tough for the market to be like, oh, we need to price in more. So now it's really about like how aggressively they cut in terms of 25 or 50 and you know, in what sequence? And you know, are they going to ever do more than that? And so it's really about the cadence of the cuts. I would say less so about the magnitude. But yeah, it's high level, it's a big deal. But it was very expected. I would tell you that from an outside observer, what typically leads to broader economic weakness is weakness in the labor market.
00:03:25.767 - 00:03:57.419, Speaker B: When people can't afford their mortgage payments because they've lost their job, they sell their homes. They sell their homes, home prices go down, you know, they sell stocks, asset prices go down. Right. And so it leads to like, you know, a cycle of bad stuff happening, you know, to put it plainly. And so that's why, you know, the labor market is super important to pay attention to. In addition, typically what happens is, you know, when you see these spikes in the unemployment rate, you know, you're more likely than not to get a much bigger spike. Ultimately.
00:03:57.419 - 00:04:21.115, Speaker B: You just. Let's just take walk through like an example like if I lost my job, I'm going to go out to eat less, I'm going to use less services. Those companies are going to see the fact that I'm using less services and then they're going to hire less. Right. Or they're going to lay off staff. And so typically, you know, when you have unemployment starting to tick higher, there's a very strong feedback loop into the real economy.
00:04:21.535 - 00:04:40.809, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. It is one of the most important parts of the economy. What else are you looking at? We talked about the yen carry trade last week on the show. I've seen some bank coverage that sort of at a high level. A lot of it may have unwinded already. But you've been saying in general there'll be plenty left to unwind.
00:04:40.857 - 00:05:14.405, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean Mex yen was the most popular yen carry trade as we've discussed and that thing was moving a lot lower over the past couple of sessions. And that's just, you know, from, from continued unwinds and you've started to see a little bit more two way price action in dollar yen as well. So you're starting to see a little bit more unwind. But in the face of that, you also have people adding to the trade or fresh longs coming in because it is still, you know, relatively attractive from a Right.
00:05:14.445 - 00:05:16.533, Speaker A: Japanese rates are still quite low, right?
00:05:16.589 - 00:05:58.251, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And so folks are just, you know, they might be putting on the trades and using other kind of risk management Tools to kind of mitigate some of the tail scenarios. But some folks are reengaging, other folks are still unwinding. But you know, I still don't think we're through it all per se, but there's a chance we could be outside of that. I'm paying super close attention to the price action in gold were at all time highs. It's not accelerating higher but the fact that it just continues to grind higher. It's supported by a dollar that's been weakening lately.
00:05:58.251 - 00:06:58.805, Speaker B: If you've seen euro go from 107 to almost 111 now, dollar yen had the big move. So you've had a pretty decent dollar sell off and that's helping Gold risk sentiment has been okay. S and P has rallied back pretty, pretty close to the highs once again. And so you know, and given kind of the lack of allocation to gold in terms of just, you know, looking at, you know, large asset managers, you know, family offices, etc. Like that, that commodity exposure is still super low in a lot of portfolios and this thing is at fresh all time highs. And so you know, it's, it looks super compelling to continue particularly if you are going to have a very dovish Fed. And then the last thing I'm paying attention to is just this kind of real yield dynamic where you have forward interest rates are where folks expect the US to land in terms of a terminal interest rate is around 3%.
00:06:58.805 - 00:07:37.199, Speaker B: That's where the one year forward is. Two year, one year forward is. And then when you look at inflation breakevens they're expected to be around 2% now. And so you've got a dynamic where the real yield in the economy not spot but on a forward basis is pretty close to this 1% area. And so that's pretty low. And I struggle to see kind of a dynamic where it doesn't. We don't start to price out some of these cuts and we don't start to see that real yield kind of move a little bit more.
00:07:37.199 - 00:08:18.779, Speaker B: So it's a tough place. But yeah, some would argue that if you are genuinely concerned about an economic downturn or hard landing rates should be neutral or real yield should be close to zero and that's more accommodative. Other folks would argue that there's enough two way risk to the inflation dynamic where you're meant to keep your yields a little bit positive. And so that's another thing I'm paying attention to other than that, you know, geopolitical risk is always, you know, at the forefront and you know, I do think there's some peace talks happening that could go well. So, you know, you might actually have a positive catalyst on, on the geopolitical risk side for.
00:08:18.827 - 00:08:49.175, Speaker A: Well, that would be nice given all the turmoil that we've seen in a variety of regions. Bimnet, you were talking about S and P and stocks, you know, back near all time highs, gold at all time highs, but yet bitcoin still well below its prior all time high. I mean not, you know, as we Talk now around 60k. We've seen one of the downward pressures on bitcoin has been a significant amount of overhang unloading. Right. Obviously Mt. Gox distributing from June and July and even, even yesterday, a small amount.
00:08:49.175 - 00:09:05.945, Speaker A: But you also had the Gemini earn repayments. You had US government movements like. Is that in your mind? Once we get through an overhang, does bitcoin sort of fall back into its sort of more normal long term trajectory or how are you thinking about bitcoin this summer?
00:09:06.525 - 00:09:54.519, Speaker B: Yeah, so one, I would say that, you know, you're in a period of illiquidity, it is the middle of the summer. And so I think moves in either direction, you know, tended to be exacerbated. I think the market is still digesting a ton of this stock supply, you know, although it seems like there's a lot of folks that aren't selling and if they are selling, they're very methodical and it's just not like a, you know, hit the market like the German government. And so, you know, the supply dynamics haven't been that favorable from the bitcoin side. In addition, the demand side of things from the ETF buyers as well hasn't been there. And I think that speaks to just like a lack of a good narrative at the moment. Right.
00:09:54.519 - 00:11:07.691, Speaker B: Bitcoin, when you had the strong narrative of Trump being a pro bitcoin candidate, speaking at the conference, et cetera, when his polling was really good, that was a strong catalyst that got people back into bitcoin believing in the story and really putting risk on. But ever since then, because his numbers have waned a little bit and you've gotten more negative supply headlines, you've kind of seen bitcoin take a back seat and there's nothing really for market participants to be like, oh, I'm going to buy it because this event is happening or because of this story. And so it's a little less clear as to what storyline people are buying into to buy bitcoin right now. Obviously they're the big long term structural, theses that are around every day. But in terms of what gets priced back to that 70k area or at least reasonably off of 60k, I do think you need a positive catalyst. That catalyst could come in the form of risk assets. Just ripping and NASDAQ making fresh highs, S and P making fresh eyes, gold making fresh highs.
00:11:07.691 - 00:11:57.425, Speaker B: And then folks will be like, oh, okay, I really need to own risk assets because those really perform and they'll look at bitcoin as one of the ultimate risk assets in the market. And so I do think you can have like a drift from the broader macro. But again, in terms of something specific to bitcoin, it's really tough. You know, like one of the things we've had recently is, you know, Saylor has been buying bitcoin, so that's some positive flow. We've seen one of the publicly listed miners in the US announce a quarter billion dollar purchase as well. So there are still positive demand dynamics out there, but it's tricky. And then you've got the government moving around bitcoin and they own $13 billion worth of Bitcoin.
00:11:57.425 - 00:12:15.977, Speaker B: So it just doesn't make you feel great about owning it. And then on top of that you still see consistent overriding flow. And so it's going to be tough for us to really kind of escape because there's just always so much supply of spot and volume, you know, when you get those spot up follow up moves.
00:12:16.041 - 00:12:37.171, Speaker A: Yep, yep, that makes sense. We're in a range. We feel like we're in the range. There are bitcoiners who are called the 58k gang from all the way back in 2021. It's almost been pinned to 58k for a week or two. Now that look, we're going to, we're going to be here, we're going to be covering it and we will reconnect next week. Bimnet, my friend Bimnet at BB from Galaxy Trading.
00:12:37.203 - 00:12:39.675, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Awesome. Thank you for having me.
