00:00:00.200 - 00:00:44.948, Speaker A: I hate being lied to or deceived by my central bankers telling me, oh, everything's okay, we got it all managed. Right? Like that didn't work out last time with telling me inflation is transitory, right? And I think generally there's just a lot of angst in the investor community and just people in general. And like, that's why like, you know, an asset like bitcoin resonates with a lot of folks, whether it's the traditional macro types or whether it's the guy that can't afford a home because the fed jacked rates to zero and everybody bought all this property and all the wealth effects, all that jazz, it's like there's a lot of disenfranchised folks out there. And so I think it's, I continue to remain constructive on bitcoin.
00:00:44.996 - 00:00:50.324, Speaker B: And bitcoin's over our shoulder, right? We're around 34 five. It's basically exactly where we were when we recorded last week.
