00:00:00.720 - 00:00:10.961, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains. An infinite amount of cash. I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The U. S. Banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:10.961 - 00:00:13.697, Speaker A: If you're not long. If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.881 - 00:00:20.393, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin.
00:00:20.489 - 00:00:21.885, Speaker A: Bitcoin's the best crypto.
00:00:22.865 - 00:00:24.865, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.025 - 00:00:56.639, Speaker A: Welcome back to Galaxy. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. Have an interesting truncated episode. We've been running our Singapore tapes episodes this week, so I don't have a guest for this episode, but of course I would not deprive you of the opportunity to have a little bit of an extended conversation with Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy Trading, about markets, about the election. Actually, we were getting a little philosophical about wealth inequality and how government is structured. Think you'll enjoy it. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes.
00:00:56.639 - 00:01:13.655, Speaker A: And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right into it. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy Trading. As always, Bimnet. Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:01:13.735 - 00:01:14.815, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:01:14.975 - 00:01:36.643, Speaker A: It's the first time I've seen you in the office in several weeks. It's good to see you and it's been a pretty exciting time in the market, as far as I can tell. I mean, we've. Bitcoin's looking pretty sturdy, although we're pulled back a bit from where we were. But it doesn't feel like it wants to go much lower. What's your sort of take on the. Are we a ball? What is a beach ball underwater?
00:01:36.699 - 00:01:47.925, Speaker B: People say you could say that. I think the dynamics for the next, you know, five to six weeks are entirely dependent on the election outcome.
00:01:47.965 - 00:01:48.493, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:48.629 - 00:03:20.999, Speaker B: And so there's a pool of capital that is going to speculate on the election outcome before the election. And then there's a ton more capital that's likely going to make a ton of allocation decisions after the election result is known. And so I think it's pretty clear to me that in a Trump presidency or a Trump victory, crypto should outperform and will be a popular trade for folks that have yet to allocate to the space that are looking to potentially allocate, I think the election is the biggest catalyst that's in the market in terms of what price action is going to do. Leading in, you'd think that you have to start pricing in that distribution a little bit better in the sense that where's bitcoin go on a Trump presidency? It could break through all time highs and then trade up to somewhere inside of 100k. And so if you're putting a 53% probability on let's say Bitcoin going to 90k and under Kamala presidency the low has been let's say 50,000, I don't think it gets there because from what we've heard from the Harris campaign, they are going to be better on crypto as an issue than the existing administration.
00:03:21.087 - 00:04:14.703, Speaker A: We just sent a note to our clients and counterparties. I analyzed every major crypto issue and it's obvious that Trump is more supportive than the Harris campaign. But on almost, I think on every issue except two, we found some evidence either from their public statements, scant though they've been, or the personnel intelligence about the personnel she has around her, or conversations that have been reported from these meetings between donors and the campaign that she's on almost all the issues, she's at least slightly better than Biden. So to me, longer term for bitcoin in particular, it should be positive frankly, either way. Although the way I'm thinking of it is neutral to slightly positive if Kamala wins, to possibly explosively positive if Trump wins.
00:04:14.879 - 00:05:18.935, Speaker B: So just pricing in those outcomes, you get to an expected value of bitcoin that's higher than where we are now. And I think folks are going to be more inclined to price that sort of set of outcomes as you get much closer to the election. So I think over the next two to three weeks you'll probably have a steady grind higher in BTC as you kind of just are forced to price that in because realistically there's not too much else that's significant. And so that's kind of where my head's at. I think in terms of the macro backdrop, again, I think a Trump presidency is probably constructive for equities from a regulatory standpoint, from a tax policy standpoint. And so I think. And he's also going to be inclined to kind of pressure the Fed to maintain less restrictive monetary policy.
00:05:18.935 - 00:05:52.423, Speaker B: And so I do think the macro backdrop is going to remain supportive at either administration. And we can touch on the macro a bit more. But the other big thing has been the Chinese stimulus that you've had over the past couple of weeks. The market was expecting a little bit more of a fiscal push to come out of the press conference that we had yesterday. We didn't get it. You know, Hang Seng finished down a ton. The Chinese equities are off a little bit.
00:05:52.423 - 00:06:57.965, Speaker B: But ultimately I do think that they are going to be forced into doing massive fiscal stimulus in conjunction with their monetary stimulus. And then looking elsewhere across the world, you know, Europe is showing signs of weakness in terms of industrial production, inflation figures, et cetera. So Europe's on an easing path, Canada's on an easing path, New Zealand's on an easing path, Switzerland, some of the Scandis. There's just such a convergence of looser monetary policy that's happening and you're probably likely going to get some end to QT at some point in the US and so there's going to be a lot of factors that are supportive of risk assets. And number one rule in markets is don't fight the central banks. And so I think in that environment you should see bitcoin trade well. And so I'm reasonably constructive on bitcoin on a go forward basis.
00:06:57.965 - 00:07:24.059, Speaker B: High level, though I think that the only thing should be trading for the next six weeks is really the election. And you know, I think some of the polling data recently has been much more in favor of Trump, particularly like very recent polls, the very recent polls and the prediction market stuff. And so, you know, I think on poly Market, you're talking about Trump being.
00:07:24.187 - 00:07:26.283, Speaker A: It'S like 5347 or something.
00:07:26.379 - 00:07:46.997, Speaker B: Exactly. And Pennsylvania's widened out even further post, you know, the rally that he did with Elon Musk over the weekend as well. And so we're really starting to see some momentum from the Trump campaign. But, you know, you essentially had, you know, he had an awful debate performance.
00:07:47.101 - 00:07:54.181, Speaker A: Awful August, awful debate in early September. Right. I mean, Kamala was riding that big wave out of the convention stuff.
00:07:54.253 - 00:07:54.725, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:07:54.805 - 00:08:15.879, Speaker A: But yeah, I think you're right. I mean, she also just this week has performed quite poorly in several interviews. One on CBS was actually like pretty surprising. CBS kind of like hit her pretty hard. Basically said that her nomination is undemocratic is basically what the interviewer was implying. Because of course that's tough to argue with. I know it was.
00:08:15.879 - 00:08:24.551, Speaker A: She didn't argue with it. Great. But I agree, I don't falter. It's a. I'm not sure how she answers that question. Yeah. But Tim Walls also, not yet, hasn't done that.
00:08:24.551 - 00:08:25.479, Speaker A: Great in some interviews.
00:08:25.527 - 00:08:27.731, Speaker B: I mean, the Tiananmen Square question.
00:08:27.843 - 00:08:47.135, Speaker A: Yeah, I, you know, the VP debate last week, though, I thought, I thought they were both good. I mean, in the end, I mean, I think J.D. vance performed better. But yeah, Waltz came off as pretty good. I mean, the joke. I don't know if you saw the SNL sketch from this past weekend, but it was like they were basically like about to ask each other out on a date because they were so friendly with each other. They were so friendly.
00:08:47.595 - 00:08:47.907, Speaker B: So.
00:08:47.931 - 00:09:06.703, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. To me, I agree, though, the election, we've been saying this for quite a while. It's hard to see past the election when it comes to investing right now. Yeah. But also, like, you know, I just discount, like poll. You know, I just can't look at the polls and the horse race too closely. Like, I have to assume this comes.
00:09:06.719 - 00:09:08.039, Speaker B: Down, it's still around a coin flip.
00:09:08.087 - 00:09:08.695, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:08.855 - 00:09:27.579, Speaker B: And we've been shocked by election outcomes this year, you know, in Europe, you know, with the far right parties and stuff. Some of the, you know, Asian elections In Japan and 2016, Mexico earlier this year as well. And so, you know, market participants, you know, should prepare for either outcome.
00:09:27.627 - 00:10:01.375, Speaker A: Yeah, that's one of the things that we were trying to get across though, in this research note that we sent was that I don't believe, the more we've looked into this and talked to people that it is catastrophic for crypto if Trump doesn't win. I don't believe that at all. I do think that the U.S. regulatory environment is tight for crypto. It's not. It's really not great. But that Harris administration is likely to be just at a minute, marginally better on the margin, slightly better than Biden.
00:10:01.375 - 00:10:12.959, Speaker A: So you know that that should be okay. Right. I mean, it's sort of like it's the same as now, which isn't good. Yeah, but what if it was the same, just slightly better than now? Yeah, well, that's an improvement.
00:10:13.087 - 00:10:16.031, Speaker B: It's an improvement. But at the end of the day.
00:10:16.063 - 00:10:17.925, Speaker A: Some people are going to say that I'm splitting hairs here.
00:10:18.015 - 00:10:32.833, Speaker B: Markets need catalysts, really. And say that you do get the Kamala administration. What will the market have to look forward to on a go forward basis? The moderate easing of regulatory pressures.
00:10:32.889 - 00:10:33.529, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not bad.
00:10:33.617 - 00:10:38.289, Speaker B: That's not gonna get people to be like, oh, I gotta buy more crypto assets.
00:10:38.337 - 00:10:40.145, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right. That's a great point.
00:10:40.265 - 00:10:46.103, Speaker B: And so that's kind of where I'm like, ah, you do have some downside risk with the comma stuff.
00:10:46.169 - 00:10:46.667, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:46.771 - 00:11:12.131, Speaker B: And yeah. And if you asked me six months ago or like a year ago, like what is the average investor meant to do going into the election? Not thinking about it too hard. I tell you. The cynic in me says they're gonna pump risk assets going into the election because that people vote with their wallets.
00:11:12.203 - 00:11:12.595, Speaker A: Yep.
00:11:12.675 - 00:11:15.659, Speaker B: And Dems and the establishment, they want.
00:11:15.667 - 00:11:18.859, Speaker A: To probably, they probably like cut some taxes, give away some free money like.
00:11:18.867 - 00:11:23.875, Speaker B: Whatever, employ more people in the government job sector, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
00:11:23.915 - 00:11:24.091, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:24.123 - 00:11:28.603, Speaker B: Wasn't that a job the non farm payrolls was very heavily skewed towards.
00:11:28.659 - 00:11:30.739, Speaker A: It was like 90% federal government jobs.
00:11:30.867 - 00:11:31.923, Speaker B: Jobs. Yeah.
00:11:32.019 - 00:11:32.995, Speaker A: It's not great.
00:11:33.155 - 00:11:33.935, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:34.315 - 00:11:34.939, Speaker A: But right.
00:11:35.027 - 00:12:19.179, Speaker B: I'm not, I don't want to read too much into it. I think that Bureau of Labor Statistics was just doing their jobs and their reporting figures as they see them. But again, if you asked me a year ago, the cynic in me would tell you that risk assets will go into the election at the dead highs. And that could just be because risk assets generally trend higher. Monetary debasement, stock buybacks, even like seasonality, the falls usually come, et cetera, et cetera. But that's exactly where we're at right now, particularly in terms of the US equity market where you look at some of the big themes that you've had. You have some of the popular AI names trading really well right now.
00:12:19.179 - 00:12:42.311, Speaker B: S and P is within spinning distance of all time highs again made fresh highs a couple weeks ago. And so people aren't feeling that much poorer going into probably there's some wealth effect associated with that which should generally help folks at the polls being like do I want change or do I not want.
00:12:42.343 - 00:12:57.471, Speaker A: Or wait a Second, isn't my 401k at all time highs? Right. Like. Yeah, yeah, it's interesting but yeah. That doesn't feel like the vibes though. I think part partly because the, the election has been so tiring like and, and, and toxic. I mean frankly. Right.
00:12:57.503 - 00:12:57.967, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:12:58.031 - 00:13:14.353, Speaker A: You had one president who is name calling and. Well, one. Yeah, one. One president who's a name caller. The other one had to leave the race. Yeah, I mean like it's been a lot of to deal with. You've got these hurricanes which are horrible and devastating.
00:13:14.353 - 00:13:42.487, Speaker A: You've got the geopolitics and the crises in the Middle east have been painful and horrible and just like I feel like the news has been like a nonstop, you know, barrage of things that are just tough to handle for people And I think I feel like people are tired. We're still a month away. We're basically about just under a month away from the election. I guess it's always like this. I'm thinking back. The elections are always clickbait.
00:13:42.591 - 00:13:47.287, Speaker B: People click on these stories more than like, oh, job market's fine.
00:13:47.351 - 00:13:48.815, Speaker A: Yeah. Everyone's feeling happy.
00:13:48.895 - 00:13:49.247, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:49.311 - 00:13:54.367, Speaker A: This is when you gotta start reading the Onion. Local man takes subway to Work. I'm like, that's what I like to hear.
00:13:54.431 - 00:14:01.407, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah. But there is a lot of concerning things happening. I mean, this hurricane, right.
00:14:01.431 - 00:14:14.613, Speaker A: You got Helene in western North Carolina and also parts of Georgia and South Carolina and Tennessee. This new hurricane, I think probably by the time this comes out, will have hit Florida.
00:14:14.709 - 00:14:15.197, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:15.301 - 00:14:20.029, Speaker A: It's like the fourth strongest winds ever recorded in a hurricane or something. I read.
00:14:20.117 - 00:14:23.765, Speaker B: I mean, there was a guy, the NBC meteorologist, that was crying about it.
00:14:23.805 - 00:14:30.501, Speaker A: I know, I know. It's really. It's serious. Serious. But this stuff also affects the economy. It also affects the mood. It's also.
00:14:30.501 - 00:14:33.109, Speaker A: And by the way, it obviously affects people's lives.
00:14:33.197 - 00:14:37.655, Speaker B: It does, it does. And again, though, he's going to row back to back.
00:14:37.735 - 00:14:38.911, Speaker A: Yeah. That's pretty harsh.
00:14:38.983 - 00:14:42.751, Speaker B: It's harsh. Especially for, you know, I mean, Florida.
00:14:42.903 - 00:14:48.359, Speaker A: Florida, that whole area, that's among the largest economies in the country as well. Yeah.
00:14:48.447 - 00:14:51.407, Speaker B: Got over 20 million plus people that live in Florida.
00:14:51.471 - 00:15:15.385, Speaker A: I can't recall a presidential election that really will have happened while we were recovering from like a major national natural disaster. I don't recall if there was. It's pretty wild, though, because you got. Everybody's flying in the helicopter, doing the press conferences, you know, like wearing the, like, flight jackets and stuff, like doing all the politician thing.
00:15:15.425 - 00:15:19.185, Speaker B: I mean, did you see the bed? Ron DeSantis was on TV.
00:15:19.305 - 00:15:20.281, Speaker A: No, I saw him talking.
00:15:20.353 - 00:15:23.825, Speaker B: He's like, kamala has nothing to do with the hurricane.
00:15:23.905 - 00:15:24.249, Speaker A: I know.
00:15:24.297 - 00:15:25.217, Speaker B: Efforts and planning.
00:15:25.281 - 00:15:30.397, Speaker A: He claimed that she's making it political. I'm not sure. Maybe she is. Probably everyone is. It's.
00:15:30.461 - 00:15:35.381, Speaker B: Yeah. But realistically, does the vice president have anything to do with this crisis management?
00:15:35.453 - 00:15:51.745, Speaker A: Well, I think one of the. One of the. I don't know if it's a dirty secret. I think it's actually well known. But the vice president constitutionally has basically zero responsibilities. They're a warm tiebreaker in the Senate and they're a warm body. Should the president have to leave office or.
00:15:51.745 - 00:16:11.495, Speaker A: And that's true. I think it was pretty. The only. I don't know about the Harris and Biden relationship. But Biden as Obama's VP was pretty famously. People said, historians and whomever was one of the most active vice presidents that they really were, they became close friends. He was a good advisor.
00:16:11.495 - 00:16:25.251, Speaker A: But I think normally you just never even. You never even see him. I mean, I guess it's hard to say Dick Cheney. It's hard not to say Dick Cheney might have been the most powerful vice president. That's true. All right, well, so you're looking at the election. You're waiting.
00:16:25.251 - 00:16:30.091, Speaker A: Are you following it like, every day? Is that what you market? You got poly market open?
00:16:30.243 - 00:16:35.283, Speaker B: No. So there's a great Bloomberg page that aggregates the poly market and some of.
00:16:35.299 - 00:16:37.395, Speaker A: The other prediction markets.
00:16:37.475 - 00:17:03.553, Speaker B: And then there's some polls that come out every day. It used to be, I remember when Trump was initially running that ABC would have a poll that was out like once a week or something, and you'd literally see dollar max move based on where the poll results came out because he wanted to build the wall. So it was like, oh, Trump's polling better. You know, we got to set dollar max higher.
00:17:03.609 - 00:17:04.049, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:04.137 - 00:17:10.201, Speaker B: You know, and then vice versa. And, you know, if you looked at the correlation at that period, it was tight.
00:17:10.313 - 00:17:10.921, Speaker A: Yeah, tight.
00:17:10.953 - 00:17:19.107, Speaker B: Because that's the only thing that mattered at that time. And so I would say now there's not anything that's like, that obvious. That obvious.
00:17:19.171 - 00:17:19.627, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:19.731 - 00:18:02.901, Speaker B: But, you know, like, at the end of the day, like, what makes America so special? It's the dynamism in the economy. And regardless of who's the president, they're not gonna destroy Silicon Valley. Right. They're not gonna destroy the system of checks and balances. They're not gonna destroy the free market economy that has helped this nation, like, thrive. And so most of the time you're supposed to think that regardless of the administration or the party that's in office, the economy is not going to really be that responsive to either party. It's the stock market.
00:18:02.973 - 00:18:04.485, Speaker A: You're right. That should be true.
00:18:04.605 - 00:18:12.451, Speaker B: And that has been true. You could argue that certain ones have been better than. For sure than others, but high level, like.
00:18:12.523 - 00:18:18.595, Speaker A: Well, yeah, if you go back and look at the chart of the S and P and you click all for all the way time back, it's just up only for up only. Yeah.
00:18:18.675 - 00:18:30.747, Speaker B: Regardless of who's president. And so, you know, that's kind of, you know, as a US Equity investor, like, you might not care that much, especially if you're thinking on bigger time.
00:18:30.811 - 00:18:41.489, Speaker A: That's a refreshing take because I think people get so caught up in the horse race and the competition, America feels so divided over this issue, over many issues. Right.
00:18:41.537 - 00:18:50.649, Speaker B: I mean, there's some things though that I'm like very concerned about on the left, like the taxation of unrealized capital. Right.
00:18:50.697 - 00:18:52.881, Speaker A: Something like that would absolutely destroy Silicon Valley.
00:18:52.913 - 00:18:54.777, Speaker B: Would it not be insane?
00:18:54.881 - 00:19:01.841, Speaker A: Right. You can't run a startup, you get an uplift valuation as a founder, but you don't actually have that money.
00:19:01.913 - 00:19:04.285, Speaker B: You don't, it's not a liquid equity.
00:19:04.745 - 00:19:17.369, Speaker A: You'd be forced to divest from your company just to pay the tax off on an unreal. So yes, there are some. But I agree. But that's also really very unlikely, right? I mean, that's like such an insane policy. You couldn't. That would break the economy.
00:19:17.457 - 00:19:21.473, Speaker B: It just like the fact that it's even being floated though is concerning.
00:19:21.529 - 00:19:21.977, Speaker A: That's true.
00:19:22.041 - 00:19:31.259, Speaker B: Right. Like, because you'd want these, these types of like real structural policy changes to be vetted. Right. And I don't know, I mean, I.
00:19:31.267 - 00:19:48.067, Speaker A: Saw a video, one of these like, you know, vloggers or, you know, that's very common now when they go around asking people stuff on a college campus. I saw this video where they, many of the students, they said, are you more capitalist or socialist? Most said socialist. And that is, that is a concerning thing to me that.
00:19:48.171 - 00:19:57.243, Speaker B: Well, I disagree in the entirety because like the US Is socialist. Like where do you think like two thirds of the government budget is spent?
00:19:57.299 - 00:19:57.827, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:57.971 - 00:20:17.807, Speaker B: It's social services, Medicare and other social services. Right. And so that's a healthy amount of the budget that goes towards. And whether it was Trump or whether it was Biden, stimulus checks still went.
00:20:17.831 - 00:20:38.081, Speaker A: Out during COVID True, but doesn't the fact that people are self identifying that way, isn't that what sort of helps to. It aids in the environment. That leads to something like a tax on unrealized gains being even proposed. Isn't it? Isn't it? There's a material degrading in the belief in the American capitalist system. Is that. Do you not agree?
00:20:38.153 - 00:20:48.649, Speaker B: I mean, I think what you're highlighting is just the fact that folks have been disillusioned in terms of achieving the American dream.
00:20:48.697 - 00:20:48.881, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:48.913 - 00:20:55.963, Speaker B: I read a post yesterday that said the American dream Now costs about $4.4 million. Right?
00:20:56.019 - 00:20:59.331, Speaker A: That's home ownership, college kids, family.
00:20:59.403 - 00:21:43.145, Speaker B: So the facts, the numbers were around like $900,000 for home ownership, two kids, raising two kids, about another $900,000 retirement, which is I think $1.6 million. Your funeral, which is about $8,000 vehicles, automotives, over time, et cetera. That's a couple hundred thousand dollars as well. But the numbers got to like about $4.4 million for the American dream. And so tell me what portion of America or portion of folks that are in the early side of their careers actually feels like that American dream is attainable? Right.
00:21:43.145 - 00:22:19.095, Speaker B: The numbers don't add up in terms of average wages, out of college, wage growth, et cetera. Like if you don't already own houses, housing costs, home costs, et cetera. And so that's where the real disillusionment is right now. And why you're probably seeing more folks being like, socialism might be the answer, universal basic income, et cetera, to kind of even the playing field. Because right now a lot of the stuff that you would have hoped was attainable for a lot more people isn't. And if we're being honest, neither administration is really going to fix that.
00:22:19.595 - 00:22:23.027, Speaker A: These are longer term structural issues, right? Correct.
00:22:23.211 - 00:22:25.803, Speaker B: Well, you print a bunch of money.
00:22:25.979 - 00:22:28.363, Speaker A: And it helps asset owners.
00:22:28.459 - 00:22:31.899, Speaker B: Asset owners, yeah. Right. And then it's just, I mean, how.
00:22:31.907 - 00:22:36.221, Speaker A: Much were the stimulus checks actually in total? Like 2 grand or 1500.
00:22:36.333 - 00:22:38.733, Speaker B: I think it added up to over $3000.
00:22:38.829 - 00:22:42.453, Speaker A: They really did, those mad lads. They sent everyone 3k.
00:22:42.469 - 00:22:45.545, Speaker B: They sent three checks of like over 1000 bucks each.
00:22:46.005 - 00:22:50.957, Speaker A: And they didn't even send them, they just deposit direct deposited them into your tax bank account.
00:22:51.061 - 00:23:00.061, Speaker B: And then on top of that, you know, you had the PPP loans, right, the student loan forgiveness, but like you're looking at housing of student loans.
00:23:00.133 - 00:23:14.955, Speaker A: I mean that stuff is meaningful. But the stimmy is something those stimmies, as they were called at the time, humorously, but it doesn't really amount to the same thing as an asset owner's values appreciating dramatically when you print money.
00:23:15.075 - 00:24:01.241, Speaker B: Yeah, a couple kasdaq performance in 2021 and from the depths of COVID et cetera, or how much home prices have appreciated since COVID et cetera. It's insane. And then you get these structural advantages. It's like, okay, wait, all the people that own mortgages at 3% or lower, they're never going to sell their homes and their rental irr is going to be huge. So they're just going to keep those homes. And the folks that are renters now with mortgage rates so high, they can't, you know, and then it's like, you know, the asset owners have such a big advantage already. Yeah, like how are you really going to compete with them? It's Brutal.
00:24:01.313 - 00:24:02.241, Speaker A: It is, it is.
00:24:02.353 - 00:24:05.715, Speaker B: Well, but that speaks to like basically like wealth inequality.
00:24:05.795 - 00:24:06.779, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's right.
00:24:06.827 - 00:24:09.635, Speaker B: And it's like the haves and the have nots.
00:24:09.755 - 00:24:10.059, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:10.107 - 00:24:25.011, Speaker B: Like how are you ever really going to bridge that gap? You're not. Unless you have like a very radical change in like how the government is structured and taxation policy and you know, it's.
00:24:25.043 - 00:24:37.261, Speaker A: You need a more dynamic startup driven and economy where people can build and create things more easily. Theoretically is a way to. Is a capitalist response to that question. Obviously.
00:24:37.413 - 00:24:37.813, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:37.869 - 00:24:38.917, Speaker A: Parts of the left.
00:24:39.101 - 00:24:42.405, Speaker B: Capitalism just leads to further centralization and stuff too.
00:24:42.445 - 00:24:56.487, Speaker A: Yeah, well, well it depends. I mean I think there's an argument to be made that a more libertarian economy where actually the like anti monopoly regulator like the. And I guess it would be the ftc. No, the. Is that right? Yeah. The Federal Trade Commission.
00:24:56.591 - 00:24:57.327, Speaker B: Depends.
00:24:57.511 - 00:25:21.207, Speaker A: Theoretically in a sort of like a libertarian capitalist utopia, one outcome could be where the only big or the biggest government office is purely the anti monopoly part of the. Because it helps to create an economy of many smaller dynamic companies rather than several giant conglomerates. Like anyway, that's pretty theoretical to be clear. Very theoretical idea.
00:25:21.271 - 00:25:36.573, Speaker B: I mean you're. Okay, so these two companies can't merge or this big company has to be like six different separate small companies. The people that actually own the underlying equity of the six underlying are still going to be the people with the most amount of wealth.
00:25:36.629 - 00:25:37.205, Speaker A: That's right.
00:25:37.325 - 00:26:09.809, Speaker B: And you know, high level. One of the things that has always. I've always disagreed with in terms of, you know, I do agree that fix the money, fix the world sort of philosophy with Bitcoin. You mean with Bitcoin, you know, there's a lot of positive externalities to come from moving more folks onto bitcoin and decentralized money, especially in emerging markets. However, like there's still gonna be a component where it's like ton of wealthy folks that own bitcoin.
00:26:09.857 - 00:26:29.809, Speaker A: It's gonna be a power law probably forever. Like you see power laws across nature. Like it's not. Yeah. The idea. This is I think, I mean this is why like a forced, you know, equity, like a straight up communist society is so disruptive because like everything in nature, like a gradient emerges. Right.
00:26:29.809 - 00:26:42.977, Speaker A: And yes, bitcoin is not going to magically help, you know, make poor people not poor. Right. I mean I think if you now if you own and hold Bitcoin, you should know that there's no central bank that can debase the value of your coins.
00:26:43.081 - 00:26:43.577, Speaker B: Correct.
00:26:43.681 - 00:27:10.671, Speaker A: But that's, you know, maybe about it theoretically. I agree the externalities are interesting. You know, if you listen to some of the more, you know, bitcoin maximalist lines of thought about a deflationary currency having downstream effects. Right? Like less literally, like people will build things with a more long term vision. Right. You're not going to trade your bitcoin for a house made out of vinyl siding, but you might trade it for one made out of stone, for example. Right? Yeah.
00:27:10.671 - 00:27:29.455, Speaker A: And that like this has could play out across. But yes, even that story doesn't necessarily mean that wealth inequality is no longer a problem at all. Yeah, this has been good. My friend. Thank you for this extended more episode of Musings and thanks for coming on Galaxy Brains.
