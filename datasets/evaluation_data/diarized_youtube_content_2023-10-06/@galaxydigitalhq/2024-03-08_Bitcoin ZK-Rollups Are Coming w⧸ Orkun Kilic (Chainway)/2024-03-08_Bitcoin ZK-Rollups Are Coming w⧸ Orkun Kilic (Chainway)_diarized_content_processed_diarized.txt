Thank you for listening to Galaxy Brains. We have a great show for you today. Orkin Killich, CEO of Chainway Labs, co creator of Citria. The first ZK roll up on bitcoin is our guest. It's a great conversation.
00:01:12.174 - 00:01:36.874, Speaker A: I should disclose Galaxy Ventures led their recent investment round, so they are investors in Citria and Chainway. Of course. We'll also check with our good friend Bimnet, a BB from Galaxy trading, as always, to talk about markets and macro. Bitcoin, all time high, new all time high this week. That's a rare thing that I get to say. 69,000. 338 by my count, surpassing the 69,000 flat from November 2021.
00:01:36.874 - 00:01:57.938, Speaker A: Before we get to the show, I need to remind you to please refer to the link to disclaimer in the podcast notes, and note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer, recommendation, or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Man, it's hot in here. Because we're heating up. Finn, that was a great wrap. First of all. Well done.
00:01:58.024 - 00:01:58.866, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:01:59.048 - 00:02:02.594, Speaker A: Nobody needs to know how many takes we did. Could have been the first one. We don't know.
00:02:02.632 - 00:02:03.186, Speaker C: It could have been.
00:02:03.208 - 00:02:10.518, Speaker A: It's like exactly Schrodinger's cat, right? The wrap is either one and done, or it takes 50 tries. You don't know until you open the box.
00:02:10.604 - 00:02:10.998, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:02:11.084 - 00:02:57.670, Speaker A: And I will say, since this all time high and the climb to it, the mood in this office, and with you and bim and other folks that have come on the show seems quite singular. And I wanted to ask a question. What is the non financial take on the mood, the euphoria, like, emotionally, how is everybody doing? How are you doing? Yeah, it's been a wild ride. I think I described last Wednesday when we recorded our previous episode, the one that ran last week with Commissioner Hester purse. Last Wednesday was a crazy day. I think bitcoin ran up to 64 and then nuked back into the mid to low fifty s. I described it as almost a sense of panic mixed with euphoria.
00:02:57.670 - 00:03:29.022, Speaker A: Tuesday, yesterday, as we're recording, Tuesday, March 5, where we broke this all time high, also an incredibly volatile day. Ran up to 69, 300, dumped $1,000, traded at 59, two at one point. Right. And then recovered paired losses. Now we're in the $67,000 range. So, look, as we go higher, a smaller percentage move is required to move a lot of dollars around. But I would just say, look, this is a long time coming.
00:03:29.022 - 00:03:48.520, Speaker A: Many of us are true believers in the future of bitcoin and public blockchains. And we really did endure a very brutal bear market. Something like 846 days since the last all time. Yeah. So, I mean, that's a long time. And we know the carnage, we won't rehash it, but a lot of carnage happened during that time. So just want to tell everybody we're back.
00:03:48.520 - 00:03:58.630, Speaker A: Really. We never left. We shouldn't have left. Well, we didn't leave. You can go back and watch our episode. Yeah, nobody lost faith, it seems. Well, but the story rolls on, my friend.
00:03:58.630 - 00:04:34.706, Speaker A: And look, people want elites, the entrenched interest. They want you to believe that the world as it is today, it's in its final state, that institutions will always be there, they're permanent, that systems are secure, that every problem has been solved. That is the tendency of existing power. But I'm here to tell you that all revolutions disrupt existing power structures and ways of thinking. Don't buy the hype. Every single advancement in human history, major advancement, was incredibly disruptive. And it flew directly in the face of that lie that the system always wants to tell you, that everything is in its right place.
00:04:34.706 - 00:04:47.522, Speaker A: There's always more to be done. And I believe bitcoin is major advancement that will also equally revolutionize. Let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abbi from Galaxy trading. As always, BiMnet, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:04:47.586 - 00:04:49.254, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, man.
00:04:49.292 - 00:05:16.354, Speaker A: It's been an exciting, continues to be exciting. We said this, so we're recording on Wednesday, March 6, but on Tuesday, March 5, yesterday, bitcoin made a new all time high. I have to call it out because that's a rare occasion. So 69, 338 is what I have. The new all time high. That was Coinbase's price at a point on Tuesday morning, surpassing the previous all time high again using Coinbase of 69,000 flat. A lot of volatility, though.
00:05:16.354 - 00:05:32.550, Speaker A: Yesterday, a $10,000 move. We shortly thereafter traded as low as 5200 before pairing losses and trading right back up to the 63k range. Now it's 67,000, basically. I don't know. What's your reaction?
00:05:33.210 - 00:06:17.240, Speaker B: I think this price action wasn't easy to call, but the writing was definitely on the wall or on the cards. Generally speaking, when you have a market skyrocket just over a certain period, and when these types of assets hit resistance levels, especially ones as significant as a prior all time high, you rarely take those out on a first go. It generally requires multiple tests. And so seeing a big sell off into resistance after leverage got insanely overextended with funding rates and oi at super elevated levels, I think that was just.
00:06:17.610 - 00:06:18.920, Speaker A: Par for the course.
00:06:19.930 - 00:06:55.150, Speaker B: And I think in terms of what you saw with 60k, essentially holding is characteristic of an asset that has been institutionalized. What do you typically get when you have an institutional asset class? Is you get a bunch of dip buyers, right? Institutions aren't the types of folks trying to pay the highs. They buy dips, they wait for corrections. And so I think seeing a healthy bounce off of 60k, seeing strong ETF inflow numbers really strong, suggests that they're dip buyers in the space.
00:06:55.220 - 00:07:11.122, Speaker A: Tuesday was the largest net inflows into the etfs since day one. So day one was larger by like 10 million. Again, on a net basis. Huge volume, by far the biggest traded volume day in, over $10 billion worth of volume traded on those etfs on Tuesday. Truly wild.
00:07:11.186 - 00:07:52.580, Speaker B: I mean, it's insane. And again, another sign of institutionalized, right? The deeper the liquidity, the more liquid, obviously liquidity part of it is how much price impact you have for something you trade. And so, clearly we're having a lot of price impact, but the volumes are such that it's acceptable for folks to traffic in decent size in it. And so that generally begets more institutions. And so everything you've seen so far is healthy. And I think that the macro landscape is certainly helping as well. Gold is at an all time high now, right? Broke through 2100.
00:07:52.580 - 00:08:28.830, Speaker B: And basically everybody is like, oh my God, do I need more gold in a portfolio? Do I buy gold calls? And I think the reason why gold's up there, it's not because us rates are crazy bid or we've priced out. We started the year around seven cuts priced in, you're at like three and a half now, or three ish. And that would have generally been supportive of gold lower, but that's not what's happened. And so what I think is happening is just the world coming to grips with the structural reality of the fiscal situation.
00:08:28.980 - 00:08:36.222, Speaker A: Yeah. Bitcoin and gold, both all time highs on Tuesday, March 5, 1st time they've ever hit all time highs together. Makes sense.
00:08:36.276 - 00:08:41.390, Speaker B: Bitcoin and SP Nasdaq are at all time highs. So it's a risk asset and a debasement.
00:08:41.470 - 00:08:50.680, Speaker A: Let's go to your the, you said the fiscal situations are becoming apparent globally. What else is out there that macro is concerned about?
00:08:51.050 - 00:09:41.014, Speaker B: I mean like the general supply of fixed income, right? I think I read some stat, there's 40% more treasuries that are going to have to be absorbed by the market than mature in this month of March alone. And that's not including like corporate debt. Right. And then the Fed on top of that is reducing its balance sheet. And then you throw in what's happening with the regional banks and stuff, and they don't have strong appetite to buy paper like the BTFP just went away. Dealers, I don't know if they have a strong appetite or not. But anyway, it's a lot of paper to absorb for any institution or any reserve level that the Fed can reasonably run.
00:09:41.052 - 00:09:51.202, Speaker A: At the moment they're saying that now that every 100 days the US is adding a trillion to its national debt. At this point, that's the rate. That's shocking.
00:09:51.266 - 00:09:55.834, Speaker B: Shocking. And then you just keep running the math on that. The math gets worse by the day, right?
00:09:55.872 - 00:09:58.662, Speaker A: It gets a shorter time period to add that trillion.
00:09:58.806 - 00:10:16.766, Speaker B: Yes, but it's also just like then it's your debt servicing. And with interest rates so high as debt rolls off that was lower yielding. The Fed has to issue all these bills and other treasuries that are far higher yielding than those that are maturing.
00:10:16.878 - 00:10:35.682, Speaker A: So this creates a fear of if we play it all the way out of parabolic debt can't be serviced, so then governments have to pay more to service it, so they have to cut back on other stuff, and that leads to recessions tax turmoil and they also leads to revolution, basically, potentially.
00:10:35.746 - 00:10:43.942, Speaker B: But it's also like, in theory, what's your best way out of a lot of debt. And we've seen the story in em. It's a lot of inflation and devalue your currency.
00:10:44.006 - 00:10:44.522, Speaker A: I see.
00:10:44.576 - 00:11:06.898, Speaker B: Right. Gold and hard assets should do well. And the argument for hard assets is it gets better every day. And if bitcoin is part of that hard asset narrative, it's game over. Because I don't know about you, but I would put my life on savings, on politicians continuing to want to spend.
00:11:06.984 - 00:11:07.378, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:07.464 - 00:11:22.530, Speaker B: Especially going into an election. No, in the political reality that we live in, there's no world where getting the fiscal situation right becomes like a priority for both parties.
00:11:22.610 - 00:11:38.940, Speaker A: One guy in that south american country, Argentina, Javier Millet, he's the only one I've ever seen dramatically win on effectively massive austerity. Yeah, but it's not because he's fun. He was also fun. He wasn't wildly only.
00:11:42.450 - 00:11:49.600, Speaker B: But I tell you, if you go to Europe and you show austerity no appetite, that's just like, no, go away.
00:11:51.730 - 00:11:52.350, Speaker A: Here, too.
00:11:52.420 - 00:12:01.938, Speaker B: But here's the thing, and the other problem though, is it's just so structural. Right? Like congressman's got two years, right? He's got to run for reelection every year.
00:12:02.024 - 00:12:21.382, Speaker A: There's an old thing, and I'm sure this has changed, but when I studied policy, this is like 20 years ago at this point, but it was some stat that was like an average congressperson, when they get elected, has to basically raise $6,500 a week in order to get reelected. And that actually forces a lot of them to not even be in Washington very often spend most of their time back at home raising money.
00:12:21.436 - 00:12:22.022, Speaker B: Right? Yeah.
00:12:22.076 - 00:12:37.966, Speaker A: So you got two strategies. You raise a ton of money at home, or you basically make a name for yourself on television in Washington and raise national money that way. Those are basically, and so they have to spend all of their time, by the time they get elected, they got to immediately get elected again. And that really makes it hard to do policy. And it makes it hard.
00:12:37.988 - 00:12:42.282, Speaker B: How are you going to solve one of the biggest policy challenges that we're going to have over the next couple of decades?
00:12:42.346 - 00:12:42.574, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:42.612 - 00:12:52.174, Speaker B: And then it's also just as a function of, like, who's getting elected, who's in power. It's people that have benefited from 30 years of insane fiscal spending and packages.
00:12:52.222 - 00:12:57.534, Speaker A: And low rates, the average age of a member of Congress in the Senate.
00:12:57.582 - 00:13:07.062, Speaker B: And they're not thinking about the debt profile. They're going to have when they're debt and what their kids are going to know as well as somebody that was young.
00:13:07.116 - 00:13:11.922, Speaker A: Well, and at least collectively as a branch of government, they're failing to act on this.
00:13:12.076 - 00:13:14.586, Speaker B: Young people don't vote as much. Well, right.
00:13:14.608 - 00:13:17.258, Speaker A: No, I get the incentives that will misalign to solve this problem.
00:13:17.344 - 00:13:27.690, Speaker B: It's crazy misalignment. And so I'm going to stick with hard money. I'm going to stick to bitcoin, gold and other hard assets.
00:13:27.770 - 00:13:31.722, Speaker A: Right. I mean, cash generating equities, people love equities for the equities are a good hedge.
00:13:31.786 - 00:13:33.574, Speaker B: Yeah, they're fantastic.
00:13:33.722 - 00:13:35.266, Speaker A: That's what Warren Buffett has always said.
00:13:35.368 - 00:13:39.854, Speaker B: And here's the thing. Bitcoin is just another version of a fiat hedge.
00:13:39.902 - 00:13:40.162, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:40.216 - 00:13:52.742, Speaker B: And some prefer it over equities. But the main point is I'd rather be in liquid fiat hedges that I can move around in good size and trade 24/7 pretty nice.
00:13:52.796 - 00:13:53.974, Speaker A: You can't, like, if you.
00:13:54.092 - 00:13:57.270, Speaker B: And the right to privacy and holding.
00:13:57.610 - 00:14:05.594, Speaker A: And if you actually need to, let's say you needed to spend, well, you can just send your bitcoin. I can't pay someone an apple stock if I.
00:14:05.632 - 00:14:06.422, Speaker B: No, you can't.
00:14:06.486 - 00:14:08.634, Speaker A: Much more useful much with gold, by the way.
00:14:08.672 - 00:14:09.018, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:09.104 - 00:14:10.394, Speaker A: I'm going to mail you a coin.
00:14:10.442 - 00:14:49.002, Speaker B: Yeah. It's the future and people are seeing it. That's kind of like what's going on macro wise, whatnot. You never know when this fiscal stuff becomes the main focus of the market. And I think what you'll see happen when the market really wakes up to this is a massive re rating in us interest rates and the curve. Most importantly, I think if, as more people realize the future of the US is shakier, you should have a higher term premium. Right.
00:14:49.002 - 00:15:00.466, Speaker B: And so 30 year bonds like, oh wait, I'm getting paid 4% and change for 30 years. Is that going to compensate me for the rate of inflation?
00:15:00.518 - 00:15:10.302, Speaker A: We're likely going to have really like five, six, 7%? Theoretically, yeah. Does that wreck mortgage rates? Also makes it harder for everyone to buy? Should.
00:15:10.356 - 00:15:26.214, Speaker B: Yeah. Think about this. There are now economists calling for no rate cuts this year because the data is still super strong. We haven't seen a collapse in housing, even though housing affordability has gone down a lot.
00:15:26.252 - 00:15:26.550, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:26.620 - 00:15:43.674, Speaker B: Because people still want homes like crazy and there's also just tons of wealth built up and liquidity built up, et cetera. Those rates are going to, it's going to be an issue to bring them down because raising them hasn't really had.
00:15:43.712 - 00:15:45.126, Speaker A: That much of an impact.
00:15:45.238 - 00:15:57.690, Speaker B: Right. But, yeah, over the long run, I would expect rates to stay high and maybe even go higher. The question then what you're really coming to is, is the Fed's inflation target of 2% even reasonable?
00:15:57.770 - 00:16:00.558, Speaker A: Right. And he get close to it in the end.
00:16:00.724 - 00:16:07.214, Speaker B: And right now it's looking like you might get close to two, but you're going to hover above two.
00:16:07.332 - 00:16:07.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:07.652 - 00:16:18.326, Speaker B: And so, like, targeting two, does it make sense? Are you going to be more comfortable with two and a half, three in the world we live in? Right. That's kind know what other folks are debating as well.
00:16:18.508 - 00:16:22.658, Speaker A: Bimnet abibi from Galaxy trading. My friend, thank you for coming on galaxy brains.
00:16:22.754 - 00:16:24.120, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:16:25.690 - 00:16:35.174, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, Orkin Kalich, CEO of Chainway Labs, co creator of Citria, the first ZK roll up on bitcoin. Orkin, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:16:35.222 - 00:16:38.458, Speaker C: Hey, Alex. Thank you for hosting me today. Great to be here.
00:16:38.544 - 00:17:25.958, Speaker A: Thanks. Great to have you. And I'm excited to talk with Orkin because there's been a lot of buzz about this new wave of l two s that people are building on bitcoin. I guess some of this could have been built in the past for a variety of reasons. Certainly there have been l two s on bitcoin, whether it's side chains or merged mind side chains or other types of, and obviously lightning network, payment channel network. But really born out of the launch of inscriptions, there's really a huge now upswell of interest in doing more on bitcoin. Before we get into it, what's some of your background, Orkin, that you've been before you guys started building Citria at Chainway? What's your story in bitcoin and in crypto?
00:17:26.054 - 00:17:47.886, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I'm Orkun. I'm from Turkey. I live in Istanbul. So I was an engineer before. I did web development for years, but four or five years ago, I got into crypto, or like blockchain. I was developing smart contracts on EVM chains, developing some core protocols on blockchains for blockchains, Utxo blockchains.
00:17:47.886 - 00:18:30.078, Speaker C: Then almost two years ago, we founded Chainway Labs with my three other co founders. And then we knew we want to create our own products, and we were very interested in with bitcoin and privacy. So almost in the first six months of Chainway, we built a privacy protocol on EVM chains. Then this inscription thing came out, and once we see it, there was only 100 inscriptions on the main net so we already have a node in our office. So we just downloaded our software, started indexing and immediately finished. So we tried to inscribe several things and we realized that the UX is not that great for end user. So we started building a wallet around it.
00:18:30.078 - 00:18:54.806, Speaker C: It was one of the first wallets that support ordinals. It was an extension wallet ordinal safe. So we put it together. Then we realized, okay, we know ZK Val because of privacy and we know inscriptions and bitcoin script well. What if we can combine these skills and build some efficient defi on bitcoin using inscriptions and Zk. So idea evolved, evolved. And eventually it was a sovereign Zk roll up, which is kind of.
00:18:54.806 - 00:19:18.622, Speaker C: You have access to all the meta protocols but you don't have access to BTC. This was before BitFm paper come out. Yeah. Then Robin released the paper. We immediately realized we can verify the proofs here so we can have a trust minimized two way pack. And we immediately started researching and building. And right now it has evolved to citra bitcoin's first ek roll up.
00:19:18.756 - 00:19:42.466, Speaker A: It's such an interesting story. And the BitVM thing we'll get into in a second. But when you unpack, just for our listeners who don't know, and by the way, we have good research we've published on these different types of roll ups. But when you say sovereign roll up, my understanding is it's kind of like a side chain. In that sense. It doesn't derive direct security. It may post say block headers and stuff like sort of checkpoint into the main chain.
00:19:42.466 - 00:19:47.158, Speaker A: Is that what that is? But it has its own validator set and security. Is that a fair.
00:19:47.324 - 00:20:32.002, Speaker C: So it is definitely more secure than side chains because you directly inherit the data guarantee and consensus guarantee of the underlying chain, which is bitcoin. But the thing is you don't have access to bitcoin. So in let's say like specialized DA layers, this work well because the DA layer is kind of like natural and it only jobs is like post blobs. But in bitcoin not having access to BTC is not great because what makes bitcoin important is the asset, BTC, the trillion dollar asset in the main chain. So in that sense I think sovereign roll ups are like secure but their use case is limited with like BRC twenty s or other activities. I don't think they are secure, but their use case is very limited.
00:20:32.066 - 00:21:04.002, Speaker A: Yeah. And then the ZK roll up side just versus say a pure optimistic roll up. Obviously there's, I guess what do we have? ZK sync era has launched. This has long been heralded as the holy grail of l two design. But you see great enthusiasm behind existing optimistic roll ups. Like optimism and arbitrum is ZK. What's so great about ZK? We know what zero knowledge technology can bring for privacy, but that's not the primary use when it comes to a roll up.
00:21:04.136 - 00:21:39.798, Speaker C: The primary ZK use case in roll ups is the compression and efficiency it provides. So let's say you are an optimistic roll up. To create these fraud proofs, you have to dump all the transactional data to the l one so that anyone can access. Right? But in ZK roll ups you don't have to dump the data because of security reasons. You can just put the data somewhere if you believe, like you can get it later. It doesn't affect security, it affects let's say liveness and it can froze the funds, but the security is not affected. So ZK rollups make the underlying block space usage very efficient.
00:21:39.798 - 00:22:04.702, Speaker C: This is one thing. And the other thing is I think you can enshrine this ZK lice clients to everywhere. Because once you have this proof, you can verify it on Ethereum, even on bitcoin and other chains, so that you can have this multi settlement thing that you can access to liquidity everywhere. You can interconnect all the blockchains with ZK. I think that's why ZK is kind of more important for us than optimistic crops.
00:22:04.846 - 00:22:31.674, Speaker A: So let's get into Citria and the design here. So it is a ZK roll up you're going to post. We'll talk about Citria versus the bitcoin l one, how it interacts. But on the Citria side, once you've bridged to Citria, what kind of experience are we talking about? Is this an EVM compatible or equivalent or whatever? Let's not get into details, but is this basically the same type of functionality that you could get in an Ethereum l two for the most part, yeah.
00:22:31.712 - 00:23:00.690, Speaker C: Our target is have the EVM equivalency, which means you can copy all your applications from etaima, migrate to bitcoin using Citra so all the applications will run. Exactly. There are like some minor difference in blocks that doesn't affect applications. But I think this is important to access all these applications and developers. So we are building an EVM layer. And yeah, Citra is the first zkolap on bitcoin. We call it in a technical sense, trust, minimize ZK roll up because of bitvm.
00:23:00.690 - 00:23:06.870, Speaker C: And in the future, we want to evolve this, a fully trustless roll up, which I can talk after all this bitcoin stuff.
00:23:07.020 - 00:23:16.220, Speaker A: So inside the Citria environment, there are validators that secure internally. Is that how it works?
00:23:16.590 - 00:23:43.486, Speaker C: There are no validators or miners in Citria because you directly inherit the consensus guarantees of bitcoin. You don't need that. So basically there are sequencers, or sequencers in the citre. Initially there will be single sequencer, but in the future there will be multiple sequencers. So they basically sequence your transactions. And you don't need a confirmation for that. You don't need vaults, you don't need proof of work because eventually all these blocks get proven under ZK environments.
00:23:43.486 - 00:23:45.860, Speaker C: So you don't need to do all of this stuff.
00:23:46.390 - 00:24:02.282, Speaker A: So then they post. I'm just looking at the block clock here as we record. We were just making new all time highs in bitcoin. Okay, so it's a sequencer. The sequencers, like in other roll ups, they arrange the transactions and then they post the proofs to the bitcoin l one.
00:24:02.336 - 00:24:08.662, Speaker C: Yeah, they basically hand over the transactions to prover, then prover generates a proof for it and inscribes into bitcoin.
00:24:08.806 - 00:24:11.180, Speaker A: And who are going to be the provers in this?
00:24:11.970 - 00:24:29.390, Speaker C: In this initial scenario, there will be single sequencer and single prover. But we have a plan to introduce a multiple sequencer network which can sequence transaction round robin fashion, so that any prover can take these blocks and prove permissionlessly and inscribe into bitcoin.
00:24:29.550 - 00:24:44.710, Speaker A: And then from the bridge standpoint, this trust minimized bridge. Right. So that was sort of some, I would say very high level overview of the architecture inside the roll up. But first of all, just mechanically, how do I move bitcoin from the l one to the l two?
00:24:44.860 - 00:25:19.042, Speaker C: Yeah, you have several options. Actually, the most easy option if you don't own any bitcoin, l one bitcoin. So you can directly onboard to roll up using off ramp, on ramp solutions and centralized exchange because you don't need on chain transaction, unlike lightning. And the other thing, the second easier one is use atomic swaps. You can atomic swap from lightning or main chain. And the third way is the BitVM bridge, bitvm based bridge that we are building. So basically you lock your utxo in an atomic sense, so operator can move this utxo into a BitVM program.
00:25:19.042 - 00:25:37.714, Speaker C: And once it do that, there is a pre image revealed. So that using that pre image, you can mint your wrapped bitcoin on roll up CBTC, we call it citrabTC. If operator doesn't accept your bitcoin then you can claim after the time lock. So it is kind of atomic. Your bitcoin cannot get stolen during the deposit operation.
00:25:37.842 - 00:25:57.214, Speaker A: And what are the security guarantees? I know BitVM is very new, but I've seen a lot of discussion about this, of that. What does trust minimize mean? Right. What if all the operators of this bridge or the operator of this bridge are malicious? How can I get bitcoin out?
00:25:57.332 - 00:26:29.822, Speaker C: Yeah, so this trust minimized term is very abused by all existing l two players. So let's say rootstock says we are trust minimized because we have like hardware security module which is incorrect. And stacks also say this SPTC thing is trust minimized. They basically not because you assume the majority of the multisig is honest. So your threshold is somewhere between like 60% or 70%. Right. But in BitWm it allows you to have 100% threshold multisig without having a liveness failure.
00:26:29.822 - 00:26:45.182, Speaker C: So this is like kind of technical explanation, but basically you either need all the signatures of everyone or anyone that disagrees with the transaction can put an on chain computation so that the transaction are either prevented or the malicious verifier is kicked out.
00:26:45.236 - 00:26:47.530, Speaker A: So you just need one of the multi sig.
00:26:47.610 - 00:26:58.830, Speaker C: This is honest minority assumption we call. You only need one honest member. Let's say there are ten verifiers and let's say galaxy is one of them. And if you trust galaxy, then your funds is definitely safe.
00:26:58.910 - 00:27:02.978, Speaker A: I see. And it could be whomever, but as long as one of n number.
00:27:03.064 - 00:27:08.482, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. You don't need to majority trust, you just need to trust one person.
00:27:08.536 - 00:27:22.922, Speaker A: It's really interesting. The Biffym paper came out what, in like September or October, 5 months ago? Yeah, quite interesting. Love that you guys are on the cutting edge of some of these new. I mean, this is a paper. Has anyone. Yeah, you guys haven't deployed the BitVM bridge yet, right?
00:27:22.976 - 00:27:45.454, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So BitVM kind of existed as a paper. So it was like Robin's idea of a computation. Then it also become the name of the VM itself that Robin is right now building. The VM has two parts, basically. One is the off chain and the other is on chain part. Off chain part is just like any other vm that runs in your computer.
00:27:45.454 - 00:28:22.974, Speaker C: But the on chain part allows you to have a succinct fraud proofs, the interactive fraud proof game for you to verify all this off chain computation in a succinct manner. So they are building this off chain part is almost complete, kind of feature complete, but on chain part is not complete. But as we know the instruction set and off chain part, we started embedded the building on it like it is ready. And once it will be like proof of concept ready, we will deploy it onto our testnets. So it will work in a trust minimize way, enable the first trust minimize way.
00:28:23.172 - 00:28:31.082, Speaker A: So it's very interesting tech. I can't wait to see it get really used. Has it actually launched?
00:28:31.226 - 00:28:31.822, Speaker C: No.
00:28:31.956 - 00:28:33.486, Speaker A: You've released code?
00:28:33.668 - 00:29:04.806, Speaker C: Yeah, we first introduced Citria. Like the documentation. I think it is the first documentation that is revealed on bitcoin, Altus and roll ups. Many projects copy paste our documentation and stuff. And in this month we will open source our code base, full code base, starting from the BtVMdk verifier, then our breach program that operator and verifiers run. And the third is the Citria full node implementation. So in this march we will open source everything and hopefully in April or may we will launch testnet.
00:29:04.918 - 00:29:14.782, Speaker A: So the idea is that if all the code is open source and documentation and all that for these various aspects, then anyone can launch a citria based roll up.
00:29:14.836 - 00:29:15.710, Speaker C: Yeah they can.
00:29:15.780 - 00:29:20.830, Speaker A: And then chainway labs though will be building one as well.
00:29:20.980 - 00:29:38.450, Speaker C: Yeah, we don't afraid of open sourcing our code. Even though people can deploy. I think it's good. They can improve the code, they can find security issues, they can fix the security issues, they can contribute. So we will open source our code and everyone can take a look and contribute.
00:29:38.530 - 00:30:39.362, Speaker A: I like that. And anybody who's capable can decide whether they like it or not and use it or not. Let's talk about that. Well actually before we talk about usage, let's talk about some of the controversy that I've seen in the bitcoin community. There was a thread Gabe Parker on my team had written about Citria's announcement a few weeks ago. And in that thread, Luke Dash Jr. I would say the loudest sort of bitcoin developer critic of asked Gabe, asked, you know, would you be as opposed to something like Citria if they had posted the fraud proofs to the operator field which is prunable and was raised and sort of was historically speaking the accepted and approved place for arbitrary data storage on bitcoin prior to the invention of encryptions? Is there a reason why can't you use the opern?
00:30:39.506 - 00:31:24.006, Speaker C: So in this ZK roll ups, like I said, we compress the data as much as possible. But to get the full bitcoin security, including liveness issues, you have to reconstruct your l two state just by looking at to bitcoin l one. So to ensure that we have a proof which is almost like 200 bytes, which is very small, but then we have a kind of huge state div part which is still way smaller than optimum SQL apps data, but it is still, let's say in high usage it might hit 1 mb. So we will need to post this data to get the full security. We can omit this data as well if we want in the future. But in any ways op return field is not enough for us to publish this data.
00:31:24.108 - 00:31:25.202, Speaker A: What is it? 80 bytes?
00:31:25.266 - 00:31:31.578, Speaker C: Yeah, 80 bytes. It's in the standard. I think you can push more with like minor cooperation, but in a public.
00:31:31.744 - 00:31:36.662, Speaker A: Yeah, bitcoin nodes won't route a transaction the data carrier size limit.
00:31:36.726 - 00:32:07.986, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So I don't think this is kind of like use case of inscriptions or similar to ordinance because yeah, we are inscribing data, but unlike let's say Brc tevenis, we don't need to create fresh new utxos for every single operation because we only need to make sure that every full node downloads this Utxo and have this witness data so that they can verify the proofs and add up to their state. So we will just inscribe to same Utxo over and over. So it won't create Niv from Utxo.
00:32:08.018 - 00:32:10.514, Speaker A: Set standpoint, it doesn't create giant bloat.
00:32:10.562 - 00:32:11.334, Speaker C: Yes, exactly.
00:32:11.452 - 00:32:12.502, Speaker A: Yeah, that's good.
00:32:12.636 - 00:32:16.934, Speaker C: Also witness is prunable, so once you download it, you can also prune it.
00:32:16.972 - 00:32:30.794, Speaker A: That's true for all the inscription data in general. So just mechanically too, how often and how much would you be inscribing? Theoretically each is it every bitcoin block. We should expect a Zk proof plus.
00:32:30.832 - 00:33:15.430, Speaker C: Some additional data to avoid this kind of expansive data usage. So we need to compress as much as transactions as possible to have this small state so it grows sublinear. So we are batching this. Let's say it can hit in every four bitcoin blocks or every five bitcoin blocks, and it can be every single bitcoin block as well, depending on the usage of the l one. So we basically post these proofs and status into bitcoin and after some time we aggregate this proof over the bitcoin base there so that it can have this single recursive succinct proof and we can verify it into bitfia. Very easy manner. So yeah, this is the current architecture and how we post it depends on the outer usage, but I don't expect it will be every single block.
00:33:15.510 - 00:33:22.026, Speaker A: And would it be the 200 byte proof plus a megabyte of data each time you post it?
00:33:22.048 - 00:33:24.766, Speaker C: Also depends on the usage how much.
00:33:24.788 - 00:33:25.870, Speaker A: Data you actually have to post.
00:33:25.940 - 00:33:59.366, Speaker C: Yeah, like let's say everyone using the same pool on uniswap. Then the state will be way smaller because the changing account is you only need to post the initial and the latest because all the intermediary steps are proven in the ZK. But if everyone uses a different uniswap pool, then you have this much data. So I cannot say exact number, but we sampled several ethereum blocks and applied in our Zk system and compress it. So if we do like ten times more than bitcoin TPS for ten minutes long, then we will only take 1.
00:33:59.388 - 00:34:15.038, Speaker A: Block space every time you post or whatever. Yeah, got it. Okay, let's talk about usage and demand for these new capabilities. We have had things like root stock, which is an EVM compatible side chain, right? I guess a merge mine sidechain, is it?
00:34:15.124 - 00:34:16.910, Speaker C: Yeah, it's mergemind side chain.
00:34:19.090 - 00:34:33.778, Speaker A: So there's EVM compatibility. I'll say though it hasn't seen over the years that it's been around significant usage. From where do you see the demand for something like citria on bitcoin deriving from?
00:34:33.944 - 00:34:58.618, Speaker C: So like you said, we have this root stock evm chain stacks, clarity vm side chain, maybe lots of other side chains that I don't know. But with inscriptions we saw that people don't want to use alternative block spaces like rootstock. Okay. They are merged, my side chain. But what you post into that block space keeps in the rootstock network. What you post on Saturday keeps in the stacks network stack. Sorry.
00:34:58.618 - 00:35:18.174, Speaker C: So people want to use bitcoin. People want to inscribe their data into bitcoin. Even though it's like financial transaction inscription BRc 20. I don't care. People want to use bitcoin and this is good for bitcoin. So in the longer term, if you move this demand to side chains, then you're basically killing bitcoin. Because they compete with bitcoin.
00:35:18.174 - 00:35:50.890, Speaker C: They don't pay fees to bitcoin. They only inherit demand from bitcoin in a one way. So we think an l two on bitcoin should add something to bitcoin, not remove something from bitcoin. This is why roll ups are kind of important. They batch all these transactions make them as successful as possible, but still sends it to bitcoin. So bitcoin still gains fees. People will still be using bitcoin block space, but they will be paying less and making fast transactions because you have this compression layer on top of bitcoin.
00:35:50.890 - 00:36:17.586, Speaker C: I think that's why drew stock and stacks failed over the years. Even though inscription came out, they couldn't manage to load this demand from bitcoin because people knew that they are unsecure solutions. They are not bitcoin. They are not bitcoin equivalents. It is some alternative block space. Roostock is no different than ethereum if you put a multisig bridge between Ethereum and bitcoin. So that's why I think they didn't get any demand, even though they are evm or other vms.
00:36:17.778 - 00:36:31.254, Speaker A: Do you think that the growing usage of bitcoin l two s will come from existing bitcoiners more or from Ethereum users or other alt l one or other block space users?
00:36:31.302 - 00:37:09.398, Speaker C: I think both, yeah. While we are building Citra and after this all galaxy investment on citrant, I realized that I am building Citra for myself. So why this came out? Because I have BTC in my portfolio, like a big amount of BTC, but it sits in my ledger, right. I don't want to use WBTC on ethereum because you both trust Ethereum and the WBTC, the centralized entity. So I want to use my bitcoin, but there is no alternative that I can use it with bitcoin security and also with a trust minimized bridge or like ripping mechanism. So that's why we are building citrade. Everyone has BTC in their portfolio, every crypto blockchain user, whatever you say.
00:37:09.398 - 00:37:46.042, Speaker C: But they don't have a trust minimize alternative to use their bitcoin and finance. And bitcoin is, we believe, the real currency, but without having an economy around it, you cannot say this is the currency. Okay, it's a payment protocol. But if you cannot do more like everyone wants to borrow some USDT with your BTC, but they are going blockfi. This is not something good for the industry. So we need to have a noncustodial and decentralized alternative of those. This is because we are building citra and I think demand both coming from all BTC holders, even though they are like bitcoin, maxis or Ethereum users.
00:37:46.186 - 00:37:52.814, Speaker A: Do you think there will know like optimism's talked about? What do they call it, their giant ecosystem of optimism?
00:37:52.862 - 00:37:53.502, Speaker C: Super chain.
00:37:53.566 - 00:38:46.850, Speaker A: The super chain, right. The idea is that? Sure, optimism mainnet or whatever we call it right post to ethereum as an Ethereum based roll up, but so does base, which uses optimism technology. And maybe there are others, I don't know. But I think part of their vision is that, well, sure, they each roll up to Ethereum or somewhere, maybe eventually like Celestia and not Ethereum. But rather than going from optimism back up to ethel one and then back out to base, maybe you go directly between the l two s first, not using optimism's necessary terminology, but like lowercase superchain, do we think that all the l two s will connect? And then of course, will Citria connect? Will it be easy to move from optimism or arbitrum or base to citria?
00:38:47.750 - 00:39:25.682, Speaker C: I like these kind of topics because in the previous bitcoin out to landscape we haven't been talking about this like drive chains proposed years ago, but no one asked how this zkesh kind drive chain will connect with evm drive chain. Right. You have to go to main chain, then go to here and withdrawals are too long and stuff. So no one talked about this and withdraw apps. Right now we are able to talk about this and this is important. Thank you for asking. So in our case in citria, we kind of acknowledge that the ideal scaling solution is a combination of fractal scaling and volition model, which is kind of technical, but I will explain.
00:39:25.682 - 00:40:05.134, Speaker C: Volition is you basically have this single runtime, the EVM runtime or EVM plus runtime, whatever. But you divide the Merkel tree into two. So you have one off chain state and one on chain state if you want your account to be as bitcoin secure with bitcoin equal and secure. So you basically choose the on chain state route. So your transaction data is compressed and go to on chain. But if you are, let's say using a gaming smart contract and you don't care about that, then you can post it into off chain. So in this way everything is still zk proven, but you kind of scaled all this l two because you don't have to post all this data to l one anymore if you don't want.
00:40:05.134 - 00:40:46.220, Speaker C: And the fractal scaling is basically deploying bunch of l three s with alternative da layers, alternative runtimes depending on the use case. And the good thing is we can borrow all this tooling from Ethereum. Like there are shared sequencer mechanism and you can basically copy it and paste it into citria. So all the l three s can have this shared sequencing mechanism so they can be interpretable. But in the l two level, we want to enable this volution so that we have this on chain and off chain data. And it can do maybe, let's say, 1000 times better TPs than bitcoin without going any l three or l four other disconnected solutions. But if you want to deploy your l three, then there's lots of toolings that you can connect this l three with other l three s.
00:40:46.220 - 00:40:47.242, Speaker C: Here's another.
00:40:47.296 - 00:41:06.798, Speaker A: Topic and question I know you will have thought a lot about is mev on bitcoin and what mev might look like in a state like you've described with interconnecting, but also many l two s. That bridge to bitcoin, does that change the mev landscape?
00:41:06.974 - 00:41:23.282, Speaker C: It definitely affects. So we also still like. I think we are seeing Mev on bitcoin main chain today, like with orange ornaments and BRC twenty s. And there are halvening coming and runes are launching and there is this rare set issue. So there will be definitely a reorg.
00:41:23.346 - 00:41:40.682, Speaker A: So you think block 840,001, which is the first, or. I guess I'm actually not sure if it's 840,000 or the next one after. I think it's actually 840,000. You think that block specifically could be reorganed because of rune's launch then? And if you want this rare set.
00:41:40.736 - 00:41:43.218, Speaker C: Or whatever, I think it will be reorganized.
00:41:43.254 - 00:41:45.754, Speaker A: A lot of competition there to mine that block.
00:41:45.882 - 00:42:16.386, Speaker C: Yeah, I do think so. But this is good for bitcoin because you experiment this thing that never happened before. Then you can improve the code base to these kind of things. Or you can arrange the incentives, if you are a user or protocol developer, to make this as smooth as possible for our users. No one like reorgs, right? In the long term, obviously. So I think this is a good experiment. And roll ups and all these l two s that post some kind of data to l one is also be a good experiment for bitcoin.
00:42:16.386 - 00:42:59.560, Speaker C: So in the initial version of Citra, with this single sequencer and single proverb, we are chaining all these utxos together, so there won't be any mev risk, even though like chain reor, you cannot change the order of spanning transactions, because it all depends the previous one. So we will minimize this mev risk on the Alban in the initial version. And once we introduce this multiple sequencer and like decentralized proverb mechanism, then there will be possibility of bitcoin mev. But to also reduce that, we are kind of thinking about schnor aggregation mechanism or this Pls thing. So we can still keep this utxo chaining mechanism so that there is no mev risk in the short term for.
00:42:59.930 - 00:43:24.078, Speaker A: What about like if there's two citrias, right? Or two separate roll ups or, I don't know, even like root stock and citria, whatever. A couple of these now. So you've got say an amm or lending protocol running on citria that someone has built or running, and a similar protocol running on another L two. Both need to post. Let's not use rootstock. It's merge mining is a little bit different. But let's say two citrias, you're going to open source the code.
00:43:24.078 - 00:43:55.986, Speaker A: Somebody launches their own version. You've got two pools of capital where trades or loans or whatever are happening in the l two. Both need to post their state. I'm a miner and I say, well, for some reason or another, let's say I'm running both. So I see that there's a giant arb between the amms on each. Do I not try to block one? And I do the trade myself on the other one? For example, transaction ordering doesn't really matter. It matters inside the sequencer.
00:43:55.986 - 00:44:21.310, Speaker A: But if that's secure or decentralized, and on bitcoin, it doesn't matter, right. The bitcoin transactions inside a block execute atomically. But couldn't I censor the Citria like data posting and instead favor the other one where I've done the same trade? Isn't there a. I haven't thought this through a lot, but that's one of the, I know it's kind of a clunky mev because you're basically blocking an entire roll ups, data posting. But is that a thing?
00:44:21.380 - 00:44:47.746, Speaker C: I think it depends on dial two type. So if you are only posting proof, it state this. Once you see the proof, there is nothing you can do. Like, you can block it as much as you can, but once you do the trade on the other side, it will go into another proof. So eventually you have to let all this proof go into the bitcoin l one. So I don't think there is a huge risk there. But obviously, if you can censor this transaction to come into bitcoin, then there are other risks.
00:44:47.746 - 00:44:54.022, Speaker C: If you are able to do that, then you can basically block all these fraud props transactions and justice transactions of lightning.
00:44:54.086 - 00:45:06.238, Speaker A: I see. Well, that's true. I see your point. As long as the Citria proof eventually gets in, the trade will have still happened on Citria, we can't actually stop the.
00:45:06.324 - 00:45:19.938, Speaker C: Yeah, all the sequencing will happen on l two. This is why we are building the sequencer layer and like single sequencer confirmation, because we don't want to create this situation that you described, that l one decides the ordering, exact ordering of.
00:45:20.024 - 00:45:43.286, Speaker A: They say we want this sequencer, not the other sequencer. That would be how they could do what I'm describing. Well, what other risks could they do though? To your point, even on censoring justice transactions, the one honest bridge node says, hey, this guy wants out and it's legit. They could block that transaction.
00:45:43.478 - 00:46:29.274, Speaker C: Theoretically, yeah, BitFM is like optimistic protocol, so you need this fraud proof transactions to happen. But let's say the majority of miners can basically prevent this fraud proof transaction to go on chain. So if they collaborate with operator, they can steal the money. But I think this is same for all the drive chains and lightning. The only issue is BTM and chain is like all the money is enshrined into a single UTX or like single Utxo chain. So the risk apart from lightning is a little bit bigger. But this is why in the long term we want some kind of ZKP verifier opcode on the bitcoin base layer, because you immediately settle and there is no fraud proof transaction and you are all good to go.
00:46:29.274 - 00:47:08.226, Speaker C: You are trustless. BitFM is kind of stepping stone for us. It is like great improvement over the existing Altus like liquid and roostock and stacks, but it is still not perfect. It is kind of inefficient to use from end user perspective and operator perspective. You have to this front cover liquidity and stuff. But eventually our goal is have a roll up ready for a ZKP verifier of code and deploy some bip deploy on testnet and showcase the use case. So we already will see there is a demand on citre and once we have this opcode, then you will have trustless Altus.
00:47:08.226 - 00:47:15.302, Speaker C: That is way better than lightning and other solutions. So why not activate this pip? I think that's the plan.
00:47:15.356 - 00:48:22.966, Speaker A: In the longer term, that's a great way to demonstrate it. I think once Citria launches and you're posting these proofs using BitVm or posting them as you're posting them and then also using the BitVm bridge and stuff, if you could simultaneously post it to testnet using some ZKP opcode tech and just show, you'd be able to show over time as citris being used like this is how many transactions or how much data or whatever we're having to post to Mainnet. Here's how much less it would be and how much more efficient it would be, because that's often the criticism I see in the bitcoin developer community of new proposals is, well, show me the use cases and then somebody may write up. I mean, Jeremy Rubin with OPCTV has encountered this. He's written hundreds of explanations of use cases, know covenants in general, but CTV in particular, and still critics. Well, well, like, why isn't it deployed on testnet? Like, someone build something with it. You might be right that there's use cases, but there isn't actually demand.
00:48:22.966 - 00:48:30.362, Speaker A: And I don't believe that, by the way, for covenants. But this would be one way to definitively show, add this upgrade, get this benefit.
00:48:30.426 - 00:48:57.990, Speaker C: Exactly, because it works as is. But the only issue is it is trust minimized, not trustless, which we don't like either. It's a great improvement, but it is not a suitable solution for long term. And the other thing is, like I said, all this bridge operations and stuff is kind of inefficient with OpzKP. It will be much more efficient. So showcasing this simultaneously on the bot main net and ZkP activated testnets will be a great use case. Yeah.
00:48:58.140 - 00:49:30.590, Speaker A: All right, just a little bit more here. We're almost out of time, but the bitcoin community has, I think when it comes to l two s basically put its hat, or the masses have put their. The only hat they have in the ring is lightning. That's the only sort of l two that has the blessing of the majority of the bitcoin community, the bitcoiners community, the bitcoin maximalist community. Is lightning enough even for payments? Can't l two s do fast and cheap payments?
00:49:30.670 - 00:49:31.106, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:49:31.208 - 00:49:36.670, Speaker A: I mean, yeah. What does the future of lightning look like versus something like ZK roll ups?
00:49:36.750 - 00:49:55.322, Speaker C: So we are like deploying EVM, Zk roll up. And people think, oh, it is EVM. We want payments. We don't want this. Okay, then deploy payment roll up. It is still way more efficient than lightning because you don't need all this routing complexity, inbound liquidity, or like channel capacity. Just deploy a payment roll up.
00:49:55.322 - 00:50:42.826, Speaker C: You can also, like, there are some interesting technologies happening on the Ethereum side. There are some roll up types that you keep your data to yourself so you don't have to post on chain. So there is only like 200 bytes of data on chain, and you can do better than lightning with that. It solves all the problems. If there is this Zkp verifier then it is fully unilaterally exit as well. So we can definitely do better than lightning. And besides lightning, all this alto landscape, this can kind of make the demand to Ethereum and other altel ones get lower in the longer term because there is this citrea which is fully evm compatible so you can deploy any application and it works with BTC and bitcoin security.
00:50:42.826 - 00:51:08.210, Speaker C: So why use this Ethereum and other it's alt Alvin alternatives? Because you can do it with world's most real currency and trillion dollar asset and I believe it will be more than 10 trillion in the near future. So why not build all of these on bitcoin instead? You can build on alt alvans that is not that secure and manage centralized control chains.
00:51:08.950 - 00:51:47.082, Speaker A: And last, some of the criticism of certainly of inscriptions and ordinals. But even of these new l two s, which I think anyone who's worked in or studied layered scaling solutions knows that roll ups are an elite. If not, they're at the forefront of L2 blockchain scaling. But still, some of the criticism is this isn't what bitcoin is for. We don't want to make a new way to do financial services on bitcoin. We want digital gold, hard money, and we want theoretically it to be cheap to run a node or whatever on the l one. What's your response to that criticism?
00:51:47.226 - 00:52:12.374, Speaker C: I support l one scaling, but it cannot scale to all the people. You have to have one gigabytes of blocks to scale all the people. And do we want that? No, we don't. I kind of like support additional increases over the time, small increases, but like one gigabytes of block is only enough for all the users. But it won't happen. So we need to go this efficient scaling solution. So there are like three things that you can do.
00:52:12.374 - 00:52:53.486, Speaker C: This channels, we solve it, lightning, which is kind of problematic. And the other is plasma, which is the security assumption is not that great. And the third is the roll ups that you can do everything and you can have all the security of the l one, and you can do this save it at token itself also. So this is kind of like ideal solution for bitcoin to scale to all these users. I support kind of covenant, I support Opcat to enable l one scaling as well, but it won't scale to all the users. Obviously we need these layers. That makes small trade offs keeping the security, but let's say it will be faster, but you will be trusted to sequencer for some time, but your money will still be safe.
00:52:53.486 - 00:53:01.800, Speaker C: So in that sense, I think having these small trade offs and moving to layers will solve all these problems of scaling to all the users in the world.
00:53:02.490 - 00:53:06.854, Speaker A: So Citria, you're going to open source all the stuff you think in. When did you say? May, a couple months from now?
00:53:06.892 - 00:53:07.670, Speaker C: No, this month.
00:53:07.740 - 00:53:16.362, Speaker A: Oh, this month? In March. And then when will your chainways Citria launch? When will people be able to use it, you think?
00:53:16.496 - 00:53:19.146, Speaker C: Hopefully in May, like late April, May.
00:53:19.328 - 00:53:25.918, Speaker A: All the documentation and code this month. And then you get preparing to launch it. Use the code.
00:53:26.084 - 00:53:49.682, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. We will make this as production ready as possible for Testnet. And also we are contributing to BitVM from our ZK work, but we want to contribute to core BTM itself also. So this two months will be our main focus. The BTVM making BTVM proof of concept. Yeah, that's the target. And the citre's vision is to make bitcoin the foundation for world's finance.
00:53:49.682 - 00:53:59.080, Speaker C: So once this will be launched and you can deploy all the applications, all kind of applications on bitcoin. And this is why bitcoin exists, we believe.
