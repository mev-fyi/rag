00:00:10.160 - 00:00:41.555, Speaker A: Welcome to the Infinite Jungle. On today's episode, I have again with us back Yorick and Nixo, our resident staking experts. Yorick, galaxy blockchain engineer, founder of crypto manufacture and Nixo, I have a new introduction for you now or we're going to have to introduce you differently now. Formerly executive director of East Acre. But Nixo, what's the latest with you?
00:00:42.895 - 00:01:34.169, Speaker B: I got hired with the EF for protocol support. So I am on the team that is coordinating all the devs, coordinating the meetings. I'm very stoked. This is like a once in a once in a long time opportunity because the EF hardly ever hires for non technical roles, mostly non technical roles. So yeah, I'm very excited. But I'm going to spend from the beginning of September to January 1st working on transitioning the role from my Estaker role to a new person, new people. I was very stoked about that because when the EF hired me, they were very concerned about Ethstaker and part of their, part of their thing was if we hire you, what happens to Ethstaker? Because that concerns us.
00:01:34.169 - 00:01:44.525, Speaker B: And so they gave me this four month period to work part time and make sure that East Acre is properly transitioned and falls into the right hands.
00:01:45.105 - 00:02:20.975, Speaker A: Yeah. Congratulations on the new role. I want to talk a little bit more about that transition period, but I realized that before we get too deep into the show, I should do our usual show disclaimer. I need to remind you to please refer to the disclaimer linked in the podcast show Notes. And note that none of the information in this podcast constitutes investment advice, an offer recommendation or solicitation by Galaxy Digital or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Do you know who's going to take over Estaker? Is it like an interview process now? Nexo?
00:02:21.165 - 00:02:57.385, Speaker B: So it's less of an interview process and more of we're trying to find someone from the community. We have someone in mind who we're onboarding slowly to make sure that it's a good fit. And when that transition is complete, then we'll announce it. But in general we are just taking it really slowly because Estaker is so values based that it's difficult to just put out a posting and find someone. It's more about having someone who's familiar with the community, who knows what we do, who knows what the values that we, that we support are.
00:02:58.365 - 00:03:21.985, Speaker A: So yeah, in terms of the kind of work that you'll start to be doing even as you're transitioning out of East Acre, Will I start to see you on the ACD calls now? I mean, I have kind of always been seeing you, but will your role on the ACD calls become more prominent? Tell me a little bit about, you know, the, the projects that you're excited to take on with this new role.
00:03:22.145 - 00:03:51.945, Speaker B: So I really liked how somebody described it to me recently, which was that the ACD calls are like the rockstar calls of the protocol support. So, no, that will stay Tim and Alex's, but I will see how I can support in other ways. So I'm going to a lot of the public Ethereum calls right now and seeing sort of where I can fit in and where I can start to support devs in the smaller side projects.
00:03:52.365 - 00:04:00.125, Speaker A: Yeah, there's so many, I mean, outside of the ACD calls, there's the Monday testing calls there, the peer desk calls, there's the vertical calls.
00:04:00.285 - 00:04:00.877, Speaker B: A ton.
00:04:00.941 - 00:05:07.717, Speaker A: Yeah, can really fill up your calendar with those. One of the main topics that I thought we could discuss on this episode together is this debate around the role of solo stakers in the Ethereum ecosystem. There has been quite a bit of, I think, concerns expressed about potentially a BLOB throughput increase in Petra. I've discussed it quite a bit on the other episodes that I do around the ACD calls. I'd love to get, Yorick, yours and Nixo, your take about the sentiment among, you know, SOLA stakers among the staking community about blob throughput increases. Is this going to be a controversial decision? To what extent do we think that this is going to really kind of change the dynamic around, you know, the staking landscape and staking makeup? Would love to, yeah, get a little bit of a check in on, you know, what validators and node operators are thinking about this.
00:05:07.861 - 00:05:41.035, Speaker B: Basically. I don't think that a BLOB increase is urgent right now. I think that there was one layer, two that came in and said we have some plans to increase, to increase our throughput and we would appreciate a blob in a blob max or target increase because that would, that would scale it up for our further use. I don't, they're not, they're not running into any constraints right now. This is planning ahead. This is the first time that we've talked about this. This is the first time that we've really done analysis on how solo stickers are doing with bandwidth.
00:05:41.035 - 00:07:02.719, Speaker B: And we are seeing devs, core devs come up with a lot of creative ways that optimize the way that solostickers can alleviate Those constraints that they're currently seeing, we also, I think are slowly discovering that it's not necessarily just bandwidth upload or download that we're seeing. So upload is the more constraining measure. But we are seeing solo stakers with really high upload speeds saying I'm having trouble on my network or we're having stakers who have really low upload speeds saying I'm, I'm doing fine, my node is fine. So one of the things that we're thinking is that Internet infrastructure, it, the hardware that they're using, like the modem, the router might be subpar, necessarily control the modem and the router. They're using like some. Yes, but they probably just bought the cheapest modem router and they can't upgrade it. But some people are renting a room, some people, I would say a lot of people are bullied by their, their Internet service provider into using what is what they want, what they want to rent to the customer, which ends up being a scam because you end up paying far more over the 12 month period than that router is worth.
00:07:02.719 - 00:07:33.925, Speaker B: And then they get to take it back at the end of this period. But yeah, and in some countries, I know that you don't even get a choice. It's, it's like in the U.S. you, I think you're legally supposed to get a choice, but they say like we can't send a technician out because you have your own modem and router, it's going to cost you $99. Whereas if you have our hardware, you, we can send a technician for free. And so people get bullied into it. And then I think in some European countries they just tell them straight up, no, we don't know how to work with any other hardware.
00:07:34.545 - 00:08:52.745, Speaker C: I'd like to step back and do some definitions, if I may, about bandwidth usage, bandwidth requirement and what portion of stakers actually gets hit by this blob increase potentially, or blob upload. So it is true that right now people who are building locally may run into an issue with bandwidth requirement where they can't get the blobs out fast enough and they get reorged. So bandwidth usage is, this is how much I need, you know, averaged out over the lifetime of a day, a month, whatever of my validator and that's pretty reasonable. Bandwidth requirement is when I'm creating a block, when I've been selected as a proposer, which happens on about what every six to eight months now, something like that on average. Right. Then I need to get these blobs out there like post haste now, right? And that's where it can get tricky. Most solo stakers actually use block producers, builders, they use relays, they use MEV Boost or now CommitBoost.
00:08:52.745 - 00:09:19.613, Speaker C: So they're not going to run into this. This is strictly for people who build locally. Now we want people to be able to build locally. That's how we get to censorship, resistance. This does matter. What we're looking at here is the bandwidth requirement when building a block locally and what to do about it. A blob increase would increase this bandwidth requirement.
00:09:19.613 - 00:10:29.585, Speaker C: As POTUS has eloquently argued in most of the world, we're running into limits here and we can't easily lift them. Now I. So from here, what do I think about this? We're at about 80% of the blob target and 40% of the max. So I can see where someone like Vitalik says, how about we increase the blobs right now to enable L2 scaling while we're waiting for peerdos so we can scale at least a little bit more because there is competition still ongoing between chains. Right. And maybe in a way we can say, well, you know, Mr. Solostaker, we're going to reduce the minimum amount you need to put down for a validator because that is potentially a much higher barrier to becoming a validator than the bandwidth.
00:10:29.585 - 00:11:34.393, Speaker C: But we're still at the problem of, well, what happens if I'm building locally? So there are some ideas out there on how to optimize for this to handle this bandwidth requirement problem. And it's something that does not require a hard fork. The Sigma Prime Lighthouse team has started this testing and it's looking very promising. And basically what they're doing is they're saying, let's add something where the consensus layer client can get these blobs from the execution layer client because the execution layer client likely already has them over its peer to peer. So we still need to send them out. But we could. What this would allow a machine to do is to say, okay, I haven't seen the blobs on the consensus layer, but I can still vote for this block you just proposed because I already have them locally.
00:11:34.393 - 00:12:36.197, Speaker C: I can just get them from the execution layer, right? And then the block proposer, the local block proposer, say, you know, Nixo at home with her setup proposing a local block would still have to push those blobs out over the consensus layer peer to peer, but she has more time to get that done. So that's that's a potential kind of alleviation of this bandwidth requirement concern for the bandwidth usage. There's also an idea on how to make sure it doesn't go up too much. This is on the consensus layer, the I don't want message, where you're basically saying, I don't want to receive additional copies of this, I already have it. So that reduces the bandwidth usage sum and would alleviate that on that end. But it doesn't do the requirement. The requirement would be that execution layer thing.
00:12:36.197 - 00:13:09.165, Speaker C: So sorry, that was a lot and very nerdy. But in a nutshell, it is possible to alleviate this pressure that would be created by a blob increase with some technical shenanigans. The counter argument might be to say, well, in that case what you're doing is you're alleviating it and then you're raising it. So you're treading water and people are already hurting, so why don't you alleviate and not raise so that it actually gets better?
00:13:09.465 - 00:14:29.803, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the ones that you mentioned is that the engine, the change to the execution API, the engine get blobs v1, they were talking. Yeah, they were talking about it on the, on the latest dev call and client teams were saying that once they have it implemented, they want to see what its impact is on the network. But devs were also saying that kind of to your point, Nixo, that it may not all be about bandwidth. It's very hard to pinpoint what the reasons are for solo stakers having their blocks reorged and this difficulty in really being able to pinpoint just because I think the variety between solo stakers, the hardware that they have, the bandwidth that they have, the modem, the router, it's so different. There's a lot of variability that developers are struggling to be able to make sense of the data. Tony's latest analysis shows that the reorg rate for solo stickers has actually gone down since Denkun, but that in absolute terms, unfortunately, locally built blocks remain five times more likely to be reorged than blocks. Yeah.
00:14:29.803 - 00:14:40.695, Speaker A: So it's a number that's still, like you said, Yorick, that what if validators are just already treading water? They're just barely surviving already.
00:14:42.795 - 00:15:33.023, Speaker B: And I do think it is important to note people say, okay, well why don't we do bandwidth increases with peer DAs and just complement them so that some things bring the bandwidth requirements up and some things bring the bandwidth requirements down. And I think it's really important to do the things that bring those bandwidth requirements down first and see how they affect the network. Because the risk of doing that is so low, especially because we haven't really run into full blobs yet. We're not really running into a constraint there. In my opinion, this is not a very urgent problem. But the risk that we run into if we raise bandwidth requirements and don't end up seeing what we expect to be bandwidth decreases, decrease requirements, is that we might lose solo stickers off the network. And it's not just.
00:15:33.023 - 00:16:10.175, Speaker B: It's not just like a solo staker gets a notification that says like, you are now out of spec, like it doesn't work. What happens is that their validator goes offline, they miss proposals, they stop being able to use Netflix, they stop being able to video conference and it just becomes a really frustrating experience. And they don't necessarily understand what's, what's happening. All they know is that this is really frustrating, it's not worth it, and they stop dealing with it. And that person doesn't necessarily stay engaged enough with research to know when they can come back and what network upgrades allow that to be a less frustrating experience.
00:16:11.115 - 00:16:42.715, Speaker C: I'd like to speak to that if I can, because what Nixo is saying here is very real. Right? Nix, I can't use Netflix. My zoom isn't working. You have this issue in two locations right now. And I'm going to go out on a limb and say that has nothing to do with block production or blobs, because it happens all the time and not just during block production. I don't know how many validators you run and you shouldn't dox yourself with it. But I'm going to say you're probably not producing a block more often than once a month or so.
00:16:42.715 - 00:17:15.997, Speaker C: Probably. This is one of those examples where you said this is just bad hardware. This is the isp. Routers are designed to do the absolute minimum. We don't have super good data yet. I've been kind of eyeballing it. But we do know that a node creates more connections and more connections per second than some routers easily handle.
00:17:15.997 - 00:18:01.855, Speaker C: Basically they're internal tables overflow. They're not built for it. Right. So what we are proposing at East Staker, what we're going to be working on is to help solostakers with this and this would help them now whether there's a blob increase or not. And what this, what we're proposing is to say we're going to document one particular router model. We don't know yet which in the $200 range and how to set that up and how to Talk to your ISP to place the ISP's router into what's known as bridge mode. So it becomes a dumb modem and it doesn't do any of the interesting connections and network address translation, et cetera, anymore.
00:18:01.855 - 00:18:38.977, Speaker C: It just translates between whatever physical medium the ISP has, whether that's copper or fiber or whatever it is. Right. And an ethernet port. And that's it. That's all it does now. And then you place your own router there which does WI fi and all the connections and all the TCP IP actual connection to the Internet thing, which is specced to handle a node. And so, you know, it's going to take some time to create that documentation, but I think that's going to help.
00:18:38.977 - 00:19:04.525, Speaker C: Fingers crossed. We're going to test that in XOS environment first. That's going to help home stakers in particular, regardless of what happens to blobs. And then. So this is bandwidth usage and more than bandwidth, it's connection table usage. But it's not bandwidth requirement which only spikes during local block production.
00:19:05.055 - 00:19:31.675, Speaker A: And just to confirm, so this additional modem, it wouldn't router. It wouldn't. It wouldn't for people in the US or for people who really, you know, their Internet provider says like, no, you gotta use our router. This additional. You could still use this additional one and it would help. It would bypass kind of that difficulty.
00:19:32.025 - 00:20:04.547, Speaker C: Yes, it would. So this gets technical and please bear with us while we test this and document it. And we will want the help of the community, particularly to crowdsource. How do I talk to my ISP about this? This differs widely from ISP to isp. So I'm going to give you three examples for the isp. So first what you want is you want something called bridge mode in the ISP router. This changes the router to a dumb modem.
00:20:04.547 - 00:20:27.675, Speaker C: Right. In nerd talk, it ends at L2. It no longer knows what an IP address is. All of that happens now on your router that you bought. That means there is no connection table in the ISP device anymore. All it needs to do is translate between Ethernet and whatever the ISP does, whether that's DSL or cable or fiber, it doesn't matter.
00:20:27.715 - 00:20:28.411, Speaker B: That's all it does.
00:20:28.483 - 00:21:19.601, Speaker C: Right? So that makes it incredibly simple. It becomes a DOM modem on Comcast. This is a switch in the web interface of their router bridge mode on NAGJ here in Portugal. It's a switch on their web interface bridge mode, which places one of their ports into bridge mode. For Butter in Austria, it was a call to the ISP to say, please place my router into bridge mode. And they're like, what is that? What's going on? And he's like, I need to escalate this call now to someone who knows what's what and place my router into bridge mode. So that's why I'm saying that, you know, crowdsourcing this as to, if you have this isp, then this is what you need to do.
00:21:19.601 - 00:21:57.807, Speaker C: To go to bridge mode is going to be incredibly helpful because we at East Staker are not going to know that we have a handful of ISPs. That's it, you know. But then once that's done, the setup for the device behind it that we can document for one sample device, people who are more, you know, into networking can use whatever they love. Like I have a fairly involved setup here myself. And for everybody else we're going to suggest a device about 200 bucks with ethernet and wi fi built in and say if you don't know what to do, use this. And here are instructions.
00:21:57.951 - 00:22:39.683, Speaker B: I just want to add that like networking is always the most intimidating part of setting up a node. And like, I think that it's the majority of the, or at least a majority of the, of the troubleshooting support that Yorick and Remy see in the discord. Because it is extremely complex and I, I struggle with networking. I, I would say it's one of my poorest, one of the poorest places. I don't, I don't excel at it. And so we would like to, we would like to see this into a place where it doesn't increase the intimidation factor of solo staking. Because talking about bridge mode and calling your isp, that's already, that's already quite intimidating.
00:22:39.683 - 00:22:49.895, Speaker B: But if we can get like a guide, a one to one guide on if this is your situation, then follow this guide and that will be the ideal situation.
00:22:50.475 - 00:23:10.643, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it might actually improve the current situation so. Because right now we're basically saying, well, maybe a router is good enough or maybe not. That's for you to know. And then people are like, I can't appear. And we're like, okay, you need to open some ports. And they say, well, how? And we say, well, that depends on your router. Why don't you go to portforward.com
00:23:10.643 - 00:23:50.603, Speaker C: and find your router and figure that out yourself. Come back when you've done It. Oh my God. Right, so now imagine that we can say you can do all this with the most shiniest buck teeth if you're a networking nerd. But if you just want a guide and a specific device, here's a guide that tells you how to open the ports, how to set this up with bridge mode, how to do all this for just one sample device. Estaker cannot document every device on the planet, but we can choose. Or if you want shill one thing and say, this is good enough.
00:23:50.603 - 00:23:54.499, Speaker C: This, this will work. If you don't know what to do, do this.
00:23:54.667 - 00:24:25.967, Speaker B: This is also a reason there have been some calls recently to there have been calls to publish minimum validator requirements. So people are saying like my bandwidth isn't good enough. And responses are, well, what is the required bandwidth? Like, there's nothing published about this. And this is why this is more complex. And if we had something with a little more control and a little bit more of like a known setup, then we could potentially look at publishing minimum requirements for validators.
00:24:26.151 - 00:25:14.543, Speaker A: That would be great. And based on this conversation, it does sound as though the BLOB throughput increase is quite separate from, from all of these initiatives. I don't want the ETH blobs. Blobs V1, the ETH staker talking to your ISP. All of these things are meant to improve the situation for solo stakers and will likely continue to go on. But likely the timeline for all of these are not going to line up for Petra, especially because developers are trying to get Pectra out, say early next year. And already when Tony was sharing about his analysis, it didn't quite sound like developers cared very much about the data at all.
00:25:14.543 - 00:26:00.085, Speaker A: Their decisions about Blob throughput increase, I have a sense, will likely go through. It's just a matter of time before they really come to that decision. I worry about whether or not, because I think you would need about a month maybe to really see the impacts of all of these various initiatives on validators. And I doubt that developers will really wait for that before continuing. Yeah, before really moving forward with Pectra. So in my opinion, I get the sense that the Blob throughput increase is going to go through and these kind of efforts to help solostakers, though good, do not seem to very much influence protocol decisions.
00:26:00.205 - 00:26:01.885, Speaker B: I disagree with all of you guys.
00:26:02.005 - 00:26:02.825, Speaker C: I disagree.
00:26:04.325 - 00:26:43.737, Speaker B: I think that developers very much do care about the data. I think that, yeah, I think the majority of the core devs like focus on their little niche and they don't necessarily like have a. They don't necessarily pay attention to like things outside of their niche and they spend a lot of time like coding on that little niche. And so they listen to a lot of the other core developers who are paying attention outside of their little niches. And I think POTUS is really awesome for being as vocal as he is. And I think a lot of people respect his opinion because he is very technically competent. Competent and like very in touch with the rest of the community.
00:26:43.737 - 00:27:28.305, Speaker B: And we already have seen like the conversation, the conversation went like from full support on a target increase, possibly a max blob increase to a lot more like, actually I don't know enough about this situation. So why don't you guys, why don't other people decide this? And then the more vocal people came in and like expressed their opinions and now I think there was a call on the last all core devs call to maybe prepare it even if we're not going to see it in Pectora. So I think they're listening. I think they're absolutely listening to any outcry that happens on crypto Twitter or any progress that happens and seeing how these, these creative solutions by the client teams pan out.
00:27:28.965 - 00:28:15.043, Speaker C: I think we need get blobs v1 to think about a blob increase. Now if I can put on my optimism hat and talk about unicorns and rainbows, I see a potentially really good coming together of this initiative of improving the home staking router setup and Pectra. And only in that we can if we think there's going to be a blob increase in pectoral. What we can do is we can go out and say Pectra will increase your bandwidth requirements. Here's what you need to do. Right? It gives us a rallying point. It gives us something to say, you need to take action.
00:28:15.043 - 00:28:20.175, Speaker C: Now here's what you need to do. You need to put your own router in place. Right. Please do this.
00:28:20.295 - 00:28:34.055, Speaker B: And historically stakers have been a lot easier to get engaged in, like participating in, making sure that everything is up to date around forks. Because forks are like a rallying point.
00:28:34.095 - 00:29:05.253, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Right. So if we're just saying, well, we need to slowly get homesteaders to where their home setup doesn't suck so badly, you know, apologies to those where it doesn't suck. I know you're awesome, you know, and then maybe we can do a blob increase, we're never going to get there. But if we can say for Pectora, you absolutely need to do this now, even if that's maybe a little bit hyperbole, it might be helpful.
00:29:05.309 - 00:29:11.785, Speaker B: I would personally be a lot more comfortable if we were dealing with this in Fusaka than Pectora, because Pectoras is quite close.
00:29:12.165 - 00:29:13.645, Speaker C: It is quite close. Yes.
00:29:13.725 - 00:29:20.905, Speaker A: Yeah. Vitalik himself was like, we need this guys better than three EIPs in Vectra.
00:29:22.205 - 00:29:36.385, Speaker C: Happily, Vitalik has had other opinions before, very strongly held by him and all core devs has said no dude. So you know Ethereum doesn't have a CEO.
00:29:36.905 - 00:30:05.795, Speaker A: Truth. That's a good point. And I will say from this conversation it just emphasizes and brings home for me more clearly how important of a public good estaker is these like guides, these initiatives to keep solo stakers engaged. So especially around this conversation, I'm very glad that you guys were able to share about some of the projects that East Acer is working on.
00:30:06.175 - 00:30:13.115, Speaker C: So if I, if I can ask one more question of you, Nixo, what does the foundation think about all this?
00:30:15.015 - 00:30:38.255, Speaker B: I wish I knew. I wish I had an overall, an overall sentiment on the Ethereum Foundation. I think that coming into the Ethereum Foundation, I. It's definitely not a company. It's definitely quite messy. Yeah, I would not say that I have an overall view on anything within the ef.
00:30:39.915 - 00:31:28.125, Speaker A: Well, thank you Nexo for sharing your views at least on another episode of Infinite Jungle. And thank you Yorick for educating us and helping just lay the groundwork and the groundwork for understanding this conversation. We hope that listeners that are listening to the Infinite Jungle, if you are a solo staker or part of the staking community, please do make your voices heard and get involved. There's so many, I think, open public initiatives that are happening that I'm sure would love more participation from members of the Ethereum ecosystem. We hope that you learned something new about Ethereum on this episode of Infinite Jungle. We hope that you have a great week and will tune in again to another episode in your explorations of the Infinite Jungle. Stay safe out there.
