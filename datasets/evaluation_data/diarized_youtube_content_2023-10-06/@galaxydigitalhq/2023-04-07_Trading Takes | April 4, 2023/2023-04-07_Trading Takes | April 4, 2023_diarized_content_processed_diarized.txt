00:00:06.840 - 00:00:11.126, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, how are you, my friend? Good to see you.
00:00:11.150 - 00:00:15.302, Speaker B: Doing well. Nice to see you too. I know you're on vacation, so technically I'm not here.
00:00:15.358 - 00:00:28.884, Speaker A: Someone, I was in the office. I'm in the office. Cause I'm on vacation in New York. And someone was like, oh, Alex, about that thing. I was like, no, no, no, I'm not here. Yep, don't talk to me, but I will talk to you, my friend. Cause it's been an exciting, it's been exciting in markets.
00:00:28.964 - 00:00:29.476, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:00:29.540 - 00:00:58.044, Speaker A: Point out last week on our show you said the gold was going higher. It has worked through 2000. You talked about the incredible technical setup for bitcoin. It was higher on the monthly, the weekly, the daily chart looked good. We closed the quarter three consecutive up months and an outside month to boot. But I will say just in the couple of days since then, bitcoin holding in the 28k range. But a big geopolitical maneuver here.
00:00:58.044 - 00:01:10.012, Speaker A: OPEC unexpectedly cutting production and oil is ripping higher, which you pointed out was perhaps if that were to happen, a risk for the market. What's happening now, I guess with the oil thing and how does that impact?
00:01:10.068 - 00:01:17.148, Speaker B: Yeah, so more specifically, we had OPEC and OPEC plus agree to a surprise cut of about one and a half million barrels per day.
00:01:17.196 - 00:01:18.140, Speaker A: Is that a lot?
00:01:18.332 - 00:01:55.196, Speaker B: That is decently chunky. The US, for context, consumes about 20 million barrels per day. So it's a lot. But remember, with commodities, and with any market in general markets set at the margin, if you take one and a half million barrels per day off the market, it's definitely going to apply upward pressure to prices. In addition, some of the research we've read suggests that OPEC has more pricing power than ever, as in the marginal supply is more relevant than it has been from OPEC.
00:01:55.220 - 00:01:56.264, Speaker A: And OPEC plus.
00:01:58.004 - 00:02:33.544, Speaker B: The market is correct in sort of pushing crude prices higher. And we went from about $75 a barrel for WTI crude to about $81 a barrel. That's been a pretty significant move. And through 81, $82 a barrel, there's a pretty strong resistance there that we've kind of been at for the past three to four months. So if we move through these levels, it kind of suggests you're going to be headed towards 90 or even $100 a barrel. Most of the street has moved up their year end forecast for oil. We're in the camp of, I think in the back half of this year.
00:02:33.544 - 00:03:14.080, Speaker B: You're probably going to see oil prices closer to $100 a barrel, partially a function of OPEC and OPEC plus being very strong handed in terms of supply cuts, but it's also a function of dollar weakening. Today we've had a pretty meaningful weakening of the dollar versus gold, but also versus other currencies. I think that speaks to what we've had recently in terms of data. And what we've had in terms of the data is a meaningful continuation of the deterioration that we've seen. So ISIM manufacturing yesterday was incredibly weak. The prices paid component was really weak, which is inflation. The employment section was really weak.
00:03:14.080 - 00:04:08.932, Speaker B: And then today we got job openings that dropped by a lot. Durable goods that didn't look good. So even though oil has moved higher and that is sort of has a very strong feedback loop into inflation, the hard data we've seen and the soft data we've seen from manufacturing and the real economy in the US is suggesting quite the opposite, which is a slowdown in pressures. And some of the other things I've seen, like credit card spending data for March is down meaningfully month over month. So things of that nature point to a cooldown in the US economy. But again, energy has such a strong feedback loop into literally every good and service that it's a risk that people need to be aware of. And one of the ways here at galaxy, we think about it, you can look at option structures on crude or energy markets and stuff.
00:04:08.932 - 00:04:20.689, Speaker B: I definitely think that it should be in the average investors toolkit because that is a huge tail scenario for the market and for the disinflation story.
00:04:20.761 - 00:04:40.241, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting when you think about the cooling down should be good for the risk assets because it could mean the Fed's doing its job and they don't have to hike as much. And then we can finally, like take the foot off the gas on rates. But if energy is getting much more expensive or if other commodities eventually do right, China reopening is still happening, right? Yeah.
00:04:40.257 - 00:04:40.961, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:04:41.057 - 00:05:02.834, Speaker A: Then that has a pretty inflationary impact long term. And that, and it's awful because it's one of the things the Fed really can't impact very much. Right. If inflation overall stays higher, goes higher, even while the economy is cooling. But the thing causing it is something the Fed barely can affect. We're still in that rock and hard place scenario.
00:05:02.954 - 00:05:34.278, Speaker B: Absolutely. I would hate to be a central banker right now, but again, they are. Yeah. There's no good outcome here. And so I'm just kind of taking my cues from the markets and what the markets are telling you is that while there are upside risks to oil and stuff, it didn't go to 100 after the surprise cut and rates have been moving lower and the market is pricing in cuts. I saw this. And the dollar is weakening and risk assets are rallying.
00:05:34.278 - 00:06:03.650, Speaker B: It speaks to what we talked about last week on the podcast, which is the right tail of interest rate policy. Risk is being removed from the market. Even if oil prices were to get much higher, I think folks realize that central bankers understand the limitations of monetary policy and aren't going to pursue that crazy six 7% interest rate policy if all of a sudden bananas start to go through the moon.
00:06:03.682 - 00:06:17.242, Speaker A: Because if oil and gas go higher, I know we're really talking about oil and not gas, but if energy goes higher, then things like the US fracking complex maybe comes back online and can sort of.
00:06:17.298 - 00:06:17.930, Speaker B: It takes time.
00:06:18.002 - 00:06:51.454, Speaker A: I know it does. But there are other policy decisions that theoretically can be made in the US to put it to sort of help out on the oil front. You can literally allow more drilling, for example. I know, again, this administration's not very keen on that, but if it got really bad, there are other tools other than interest rates to push back on that too. So very interesting. So like you said, risk assets are rallying. I saw S P's through 4100, which I'm not an expert on this, but on tv, that's what they've been talking about as a key level on CNBC for literally weeks and weeks and weeks.
00:06:51.454 - 00:06:58.674, Speaker A: The sort of average near term bull has been targeting is the bullish level. And we're through that.
00:06:58.754 - 00:07:12.082, Speaker B: And Nasdaq's also outperforming a lot. I mean, you're up almost, I think, 17, 18% on the year. But one of the key things that I think is worth pointing out is you're entering a period of a very strong seasonality.
00:07:12.138 - 00:07:15.802, Speaker A: Just about to say this. April alone as a specific month is a very bullish month.
00:07:15.858 - 00:07:21.754, Speaker B: Very bullish month. Like 80% hit rate of being bullish. One of the highest months on average.
00:07:21.794 - 00:07:22.374, Speaker A: It's wild.
00:07:22.474 - 00:07:31.402, Speaker B: And then if you look at like historical returns based on years where, you know, S and P had a good start to Q one, like odds are you're gonna have a great rest of the year.
00:07:31.408 - 00:07:46.510, Speaker A: There's only a couple years where it was up in less than it was then. I was gonna say there wasn't even. Are there even any years where it's down for the year? I saw there were some. No, no, no. There was like one year in the last 30, where it, like, was up a lot in Q one, but then barely inked out, like one extra percent.
00:07:46.582 - 00:07:53.558, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that was 1987 or something where it was up 7%, then it closed the year up eight or so. Something wrong?
00:07:53.686 - 00:07:54.182, Speaker A: It's easy.
00:07:54.238 - 00:08:05.902, Speaker B: Long story short, there's been about 25 times when S and P has been up more than 7% in q one. And basically 23 of those 25, you ended up having a great rest of the year.
00:08:05.958 - 00:08:06.518, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:08:06.646 - 00:08:09.606, Speaker B: So there's some good data to support.
00:08:09.710 - 00:08:16.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's the kind of, it's sort of a historical guidance concept, but it's not, it's not prescriptive at all. Anything can happen. We're in crazy times.
00:08:16.926 - 00:08:17.766, Speaker B: No, no, absolutely.
00:08:17.830 - 00:08:20.494, Speaker A: But still, I mean, yeah, it's just, it's such a weird time here.
00:08:20.614 - 00:08:56.374, Speaker B: And then the other thing to think about is, is just like, although there's, feels like there's a lot of uncertainty in the world, still, the actual uncertainty priced in by the markets has actually come off a lot interesting. And that's actually generally risk positive. Right. So when we had that whole banking crisis, interest rate volume shot up and twos are moving 25 basis points up and down like crazy. And now it's like a little bit more gradual. I mean, today's a little bit of aberration given, you know, the data print we've had, but the interest rate volume has come off a little bit. Liquidity has entered the market.
00:08:56.374 - 00:09:20.414, Speaker B: The VIx is on 18 handle now. We spiked through 30 during that crisis. And generally speaking, it's been a little bit calmer. And I think the Fed is more in a position where it's kind of wait and see. They don't want to really cut rates throughout the balance. They just want to wait and see. They'll go one more meeting, most likely, and then just wait and see.
00:09:20.414 - 00:09:24.038, Speaker B: So there's a lot less uncertainty in the market, I think.
00:09:24.126 - 00:09:26.044, Speaker A: And they got rates up high.
00:09:26.084 - 00:09:28.716, Speaker B: Pretty high. Not, they did a lot of hiking reasonably high.
00:09:28.740 - 00:09:31.108, Speaker A: We're not at the beginning of the hiking cycle, correct? Yeah.
00:09:31.236 - 00:09:47.356, Speaker B: And so, you know, one of the ways I think about my equation mentally, at least for the market, is like, the more uncertainty there is, the lower the prices, generally speaking. And so right now, we're adding more, less uncertainty into the market, and people are more comfortable.
00:09:47.420 - 00:09:48.556, Speaker A: We're adding more certainty.
00:09:48.620 - 00:10:18.440, Speaker B: Correct. And it's also just a function of like a $10 million position on a 20 volume is very different than a $10 million position on a 40 volume. Right. And so naturally, as volume comes down, you have room to add notionally to your position because your risk unit is actually staying constant as your notional. And so as volume comes down, people can take more risk. And I think that's what you're kind of seeing with things like S and P, Nasdaq and a little bit of crypto.
00:10:18.512 - 00:10:28.456, Speaker A: What do you see? I was gonna say, how does this play into crypto? Let me set the stage here. I just saw that ETH BTC is back up a little bit. I mean, it's what I like. 0.0,645,065.
00:10:28.520 - 00:10:29.120, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:29.272 - 00:10:32.152, Speaker A: And it had gotten down to, like, 0.062 ish.
00:10:32.208 - 00:10:33.512, Speaker B: Yeah, I meant.
00:10:33.648 - 00:10:50.692, Speaker A: So ETH has been outperforming just the last few days. Bitcoin. Bitcoin, I think, year to date, still outperforming. But ETH. But, you know, is that part of this? It's sort of like, well, we're in a little bit of a, you know, more risk on mentality right now. The street is feeling a little bit more comfortable. And ETH, this scene is a little bit more risky.
00:10:50.692 - 00:10:54.264, Speaker A: It certainly is. Higher volume. Bitcoin is that part of the story.
00:10:55.044 - 00:11:10.620, Speaker B: So I think it's the EBTC story to me, is just positioning. People got very bulled up on bitcoin after the banking crisis. Fiat to basement banking insecurity, etcetera.
00:11:10.652 - 00:11:12.748, Speaker A: Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.
00:11:12.876 - 00:11:21.194, Speaker B: And then gold was ripping as well. It had a really strong narrative, positive narrative, you know, ETH with Shanghai upgrade.
00:11:21.234 - 00:11:22.746, Speaker A: Coming up, little bit of uncertainty.
00:11:22.810 - 00:11:51.046, Speaker B: A little bit of uncertainty. And so what did you have? You have people positioned for that. And so ETHc moved a lot lower. Right, as bitcoin, like, had its huge leg higher. And then you're left in a situation where everybody's kind of like Max long bitcoin and Max underweight ETH, and that's where we were, like, two days ago. And then people are like, wait. ETH has been trying to break through, like 1820, like seven times now.
00:11:51.110 - 00:11:51.566, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:51.670 - 00:12:00.710, Speaker B: And, like, it broke through that level. I mean, today. And you had a subsequent rally in ETH, BTC. I think the high has been like 1880 in.
00:12:00.862 - 00:12:02.726, Speaker A: I think it's the highest, certainly highest.
00:12:02.750 - 00:12:46.992, Speaker B: Year to date for basically since merge. I mean, merge, we got to, like, almost 1900 and change in September. Yeah. And so I think what you've seen over the past, like, two days is just a positioning unwind where people got a little overextended on bitcoin and a little underexposed to ETH and you just had that unwind happening. I think fundamentally, I still prefer being long bitcoin, but there's no issue being long, both right now. And I continue to think that one of the best ways to express it is upside options. I think people really underestimate how violent moves to the upside can be, especially when you take out technical levels.
00:12:46.992 - 00:13:07.572, Speaker B: You know, if you think about it, we went from 20 to 28k in the span of two weeks. Right. That's a, you know, huge move. That's a 40% move. Like, that can happen in two weeks. Right. And so, you know, one month implied volume at, like, 60 doesn't really make that much sense in this kind of a market.
00:13:07.572 - 00:13:19.964, Speaker B: And so I still think that the best way to play for crypto upside is probably an optionality. Um, but being long, also long and strong.
00:13:21.144 - 00:13:24.744, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, it's a fascinating time. I'm excited to just keep following this. I can't.
00:13:24.824 - 00:13:25.488, Speaker B: No, absolutely.
00:13:25.536 - 00:13:26.000, Speaker A: I mean, it's just.
00:13:26.032 - 00:13:26.176, Speaker B: It's.
00:13:26.200 - 00:13:39.044, Speaker A: It's a much more interesting time in my mind now than it was like, say, last summer. Remember we had that episode with you and Robert Bukoki and Christine Kim? I think maybe like June of 22, and we were sort of max bearish.
00:13:39.344 - 00:13:43.592, Speaker B: I mean, I think 1819k big. And then we went to, like, 16, five.
00:13:43.648 - 00:14:12.160, Speaker A: I know. This is this famous, in my mind, famous episode where we asked everyone to say a positive thing, and you were just like, straight up stumped. Couldn't come up with anything. And, yeah, that was an interesting time. But the complexities swirling around in this market now are so interesting. The geopolitical stuff happening with China's reopening, but also China making all these moves on the world stage. You know, Finland just formally entered NATO, like this morning, which is literally an adjacent country.
00:14:12.160 - 00:14:30.172, Speaker A: Adds a dramatic amount of border with Russia to NATO. There's just a bunch of stuff happening. Even Mexico's foreign minister last week said that they were. That their vision was aligned with the BriCS countries. They're interested in doing more with BrICS. I'm like, that's our southern neighbor, right? There's a whole bunch.
00:14:30.308 - 00:14:31.172, Speaker B: He's heard of NAFTA.
00:14:31.188 - 00:14:40.548, Speaker A: Guys, we're going to talk with Tyler Williams. I know NAFTA. We're going to talk with Tyler Williams in a bit, a little bit about the debt ceiling debate, which still has to happen in the US.
00:14:40.636 - 00:14:41.876, Speaker B: It probably gets solved.
00:14:42.060 - 00:14:52.796, Speaker A: There's a lot of moving pieces. That's an exciting time. Looking forward to keep talking with you about it, but that's it for today. Bimnet Abibi and galaxy trading. Our good friend. Thank you so much.
00:14:52.900 - 00:14:54.084, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thank you for having me.
