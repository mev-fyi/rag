The Beacon chain was launched in December of 2020 and officially merged with Ethereum the protocol on September 15, 2022. And since then there has been quite a lot of technical debt that has accumulated on the Beacon chain. And there are quite a few advancements in technology, specifically zero knowledge tech, that could be appl to make the Consensus layer of Ethereum far more secure and faster, more efficient. Justin Drake's proposal was to move forward with what he calls the Beam Chain upgrade. And this is again a major upgrade to the Consensus layer that would bundle many different updates to the Beacon chain in just one upgrade.
