00:00:00.200 - 00:00:46.348, Speaker A: I think the other interesting one is just thinking about nfts as being things of abundance instead of like very limited supply. And I think there's room for both. And one use case that really stands out to me is if you're like a YouTube streamer and you're a gaming streamer, every day you play a game and you want to reward people who aren't just watching your YouTube but are watching the live stream, maybe you start rolling out compressed nfts. Previously you'd have to pay, you know, thousands of dollars to do that. It's just not worth it. Now you're paying $10 to drop, you know, what, 100,000 nfts to people and it's very marginal cost to you and it's a great way to just drive user engagement. So I do see use cases there, obviously, like people are going to.
00:00:46.348 - 00:00:55.084, Speaker A: A lot of people like to say nfts should be really valuable. I think this is showing. Well, maybe there's a use case where nfts are just very cheap collectibles that people get for being loyal followers.
