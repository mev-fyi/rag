00:00:00.200 - 00:00:18.918, Speaker A: I tell every single young person that has made money in crypto, sell enough to buy a house, borrow lots of money to buy the house, but put your down payment on, take some crypto profits, buy yourself a house. You'll never regret owning an apartment or a house. And with interest rates as low as they are, asset prices are going up. And so it's a little bit of a hedge versus everything else being digital.
00:00:19.086 - 00:00:42.076, Speaker B: Got it. Maybe instead of spending $70,000 on a profile picture, I probably should have put a tow down payment. What else do you want to talk about? I mean, honestly, just, I think just kind of anything that, you know, like what do you, what are some things that you hope to sort of use this like brand new canvas or playground known as web3 to change in the space. That's different from what's interesting.
00:00:42.140 - 00:01:54.746, Speaker A: Like my big insight in the last few months is that crypto, until recently, until really, the NFT boom, was about assets. Bitcoin as a hedge for the debasement of monetary policy, basement of fiat currency, other things that you're buying as assets because they could go up and mostly because of nfts, but also because the infrastructure, the layer one infrastructure is getting there. I think the world has recognized and why the prices have gone up so far that this is really a technology play, that this is the Internet of value transfer, as opposed to just an Internet where information, you know, all went to zero, where information became free. And that paradigm shift has hit every investor I know to say, wow, how do I get involved? And so there's an excitement right now. Prices are probably higher than they're going to and they might come back down, who knows? But there's absolutely an excitement. It's like career risk in this industry has been de risked, right? Because now it's not will it happen? It's about execution and how it will happen. But I think that all happened in the last four months.
00:01:54.746 - 00:02:17.582, Speaker A: So to me it's fascinating and it's really exciting. I've never been more optimistic on our business. Listen, like anything, these are tools and it's important that they're used to make the world better, not worse. You know, I think about blockchains all the time and I think about the blockchain china's creating and it just scares the shit out of me. Right. Okay. If I want to control my people completely, I'll have a completely centralized blockchain.
00:02:17.582 - 00:02:44.184, Speaker A: And so just cause it's called blockchain doesn't necessarily mean it's for good. And so it doesn't come with its own morality, so it's the people who are building it and creating new ecosystems and models that have to have the responsibility of imbuing a morality in it. And so that's something I'm watching carefully because it sometimes gets lost in the Yolo gambling culture of crypto.
00:02:44.254 - 00:02:45.156, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:02:45.220 - 00:02:59.476, Speaker A: And nfts even, and it's funny, I don't think people should only buy and hold. Like, I think especially, I mean, I know people whose whole life savings have changed, so I'm always like, dude, sell something just in case.
00:02:59.580 - 00:03:28.488, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Have you traded at all nfTs? Yeah, no, I've never traded nfts. I also rarely trade crypto, but that's just because I'm so bad at it. I know if I do it, I'm gonna lose money. Actually, you know, that's a great, you know, I should just have somebody counter trade me, and then we can balance out, you know, just split the difference after, because just whenever I buy, it's just gonna go down, and then whenever I sell, it's just gonna back up. That's just how it works. I don't know why I don't make the rules.
00:03:28.656 - 00:03:36.832, Speaker A: So you're collecting your crypto, you're collecting your art collection, you sell a little bit to pay your rent, correct?
00:03:36.888 - 00:03:52.990, Speaker B: Yeah, well, mostly most of the work I do now, I get paid in crypto, obviously. So, yeah, that's all to say is I don't trade. Sometimes I sell because I need to use the money, and that's it. But that's just because I'm bad at it. If you have any tips, I would love to.
00:03:53.022 - 00:04:12.484, Speaker A: I tell every single young person that has made money in crypto, sell enough to buy a house, borrow lots of money to buy the house, but put your down payment on, take some crypto profits, buy yourself a house. You'll never regret owning an apartment or a house. And with interest rates as low as they are, asset prices are going up, and so it's a little bit of a hedge versus everything else being digital.
00:04:12.644 - 00:04:20.852, Speaker B: Got it. Maybe instead of spending $70,000 on a profile picture, I probably should have put it to a down payment. I'll know for next year.
00:04:20.868 - 00:04:22.556, Speaker A: What do your parents think about all this?
00:04:22.700 - 00:04:30.504, Speaker B: I definitely did not tell them that I spent a down payment on a profile picture. I think they are mildly.
00:04:30.804 - 00:04:33.584, Speaker A: Did you grow up middle class, working class, rich?
00:04:34.384 - 00:04:39.040, Speaker B: I would say we're like middle, just a little bit above middle, you know, pretty.
00:04:39.112 - 00:04:42.048, Speaker A: So 70,000 for a profile picture will have your mother spitting out her coffee.
00:04:42.096 - 00:05:23.492, Speaker B: She would definitely, I think, just raise at least an eyebrow, for sure. I think they would just go, y. And then I would have to provide a very reasonable explanation. But, you know, there's some room to give because I think this is new territory. So sometimes when I explain things to them, they'll be more okay with it. I think they're also just learning, right? Like, the other day, I told them, like, oh, you know, those two monkeys that I own, like, they're worth, like, over 100 grand each now. My parents were just like, what? Why don't you sell them and stuff? You know? So I think they now know that sort of what they think are normal and what you should apply to, you know, what the world that they're used to is also not the same set of logic and rules that they should be applying to what I'm doing.
00:05:23.492 - 00:05:32.134, Speaker B: So they're kind of sitting back and listening and observing, which is nice. And they're just so supportive of what I do always, which I'm really grateful for.
00:05:32.174 - 00:05:37.510, Speaker A: Are they walking around, like, you know, on their ship? My mother would be walking around like this in the neighborhood.
00:05:37.662 - 00:05:56.514, Speaker B: They actually don't even have one. And, you know, I asked to mail them one, and they said, don't spend that much money on the postage. But what's hilarious is my dad's profile picture on Facebook is now a picture of bitcoin. Like, that's his profile picture now. So I guess he's.
00:05:56.634 - 00:05:57.858, Speaker A: He's slowly getting there.
00:05:57.906 - 00:05:59.362, Speaker B: He's a believer now.
00:05:59.458 - 00:06:03.882, Speaker A: It's a journey. You start with bitcoin, then you go into Ethereum, and who knows? You go right down the.
00:06:03.938 - 00:06:06.834, Speaker B: Maybe it'll be an nft in a few months. So we'll see.
