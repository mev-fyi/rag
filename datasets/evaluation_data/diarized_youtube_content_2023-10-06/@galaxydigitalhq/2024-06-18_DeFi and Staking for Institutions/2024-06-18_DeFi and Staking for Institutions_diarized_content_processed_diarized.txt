00:00:00.160 - 00:00:35.480, Speaker A: A huge topic of discussion this week is the Ethereum ETP ETF progress that we've made. I think it's undeniable that the bitcoin ETF and the way it has basically enabled access for institutional scale, that's wonderful. Right? We're bringing net new institutional capital in. We would expect the Ethereum ETF, and hopefully other proof of stake ETF's, to the extent those exist in the future, bringing that institutional capital in. But what is so interesting is that we're seeing a bifurcation between a bitcoin spot ETF, which to me is a pretty perfect product, in that bitcoin is just that. It is bitcoin. Ethereum is not just spot Ethereum.
00:00:35.480 - 00:00:59.454, Speaker A: Ethereum is participating in proof of stake. And so there's still a lot of work to be done, because the spot ETF, without the provision of staking in the infrastructure that we're building, is to me an inferior product. And so our mission is to continue exploring these technologies, to actually deliver through an institutional wrapper, the real thing. It will take some time, it's gonna be a sequential process, but this is definitely a step in the right direction.
