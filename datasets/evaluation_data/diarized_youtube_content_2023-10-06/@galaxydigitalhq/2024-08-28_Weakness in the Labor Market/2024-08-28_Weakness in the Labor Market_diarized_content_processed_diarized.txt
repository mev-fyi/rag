00:00:00.360 - 00:00:45.001, Speaker A: What typically leads to broader economic weakness is weakness in the labor market. When people can't afford their mortgage payments because they've lost their job, they sell their homes, they sell their homes, home prices go down, they sell stocks, asset prices go down. And so it leads to a cycle of bad stuff happening, to put it plainly. And so that's why the labor market is super important to pay attention to. In addition, typically what happens is, you know, when you see these spikes in the unemployment rate, you know, you're more likely than not to get a much bigger spike. Ultimately. Just, let's just take walk through like an example like if I lost my job, I'm going to go out to eat less, I'm going to use less services.
00:00:45.001 - 00:00:59.425, Speaker A: Those companies are going to see the fact that I'm using less services, and then they're going to hire less. Right. Or they're going to lay off staff. And so typically, you know, when you have unemployment starting to tick higher, there's a very strong feedback loop into the real economy.
