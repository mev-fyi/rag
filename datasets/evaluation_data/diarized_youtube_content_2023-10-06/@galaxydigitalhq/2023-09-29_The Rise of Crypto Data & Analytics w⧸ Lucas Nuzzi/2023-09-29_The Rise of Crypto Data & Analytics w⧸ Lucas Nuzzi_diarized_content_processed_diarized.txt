Thank you for listening to Galaxy brains. We have a great show for you today. As I said, lucas Nutsy, head of research and development at Coinmetrics. He's our guest. He's a repeat guest, and it's a great conversation with Lucas about the topic of this week, which is crypto data and analytics.
00:01:00.840 - 00:01:34.588, Speaker A: We're going to get into it with Lucas about new products, coinmetrics offering, talk about the ecosystem and usage of on chain data, and it's a fascinating discussion, but we'll also talk with our good friend Bimit Abibi from Galaxy trading, as always, to discuss markets and macro.

00:01:34.676 - 00:01:35.652, Speaker B: I'm honored, Alex.
00:01:35.708 - 00:01:37.780, Speaker C: Thank you for having me. I love it.
00:01:37.852 - 00:01:43.116, Speaker B: Giving me a microphone almost, you know, as we approach episode 100 in a month or so.
00:01:43.180 - 00:01:45.124, Speaker C: Yeah, I appreciate it. I'm excited to be here.
00:01:45.164 - 00:02:01.680, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been a long road and Phineas is essential to this show, and I figured it's fun. I love having get some behind the scenes look, and we'll chitchat with Phineas sometimes. But for now, let's get right into the show. Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from galaxy trading. As always, Bimnet, thanks for joining galaxy Brains.
00:02:01.752 - 00:02:02.712, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:02:02.808 - 00:02:15.880, Speaker A: So we're still just ranging in bitcoin, I'm seeing dollar strength, bond weakness, equities struggling to what's the vibes in markets right now? What's driving the story?
00:02:15.992 - 00:03:23.984, Speaker C: You know, I think that there's a lot of fear around the implications of hire for longer. Folks in the equity world are like tech stocks, if you think about them as dividend paying companies or a stream of cash flows over time, just functionally, as interest rates go up, you've got to discount the value of those future cash flows more aggressively. Two, what does it mean in the context of relative value between bonds and equities? And from a risk adjusted perspective, would you rather earn 4.5% on the ten year for ten years with no volatility? They guaranteed 4.5%, or own some of the single name equities that you can. Then the question is higher for longer. What are its implications for the broader economy? Does the consumer slow down? Does the economy slow down? And if you think about what the Fed is actively trying to do, they are trying to slow the economy down with monetary policy.
00:03:23.984 - 00:04:05.344, Speaker C: So if this monetary policy does have its desired effect, like it should be bad for stocks, and we do know that there are certain things that are ramping up that should hurt the consumer. Like we're now basically in October, the student loan repayments are about to begin. In addition to that, gas prices are actually a tax on the consumer. At this point. Every time you're at the pump, you're paying an extra $20. You're going every week or every couple of weeks, that's going to start chipping away. We know that over time we'll start to see the consumer balance sheet dwindle.
00:04:05.344 - 00:04:41.694, Speaker C: However, the counter to all of this is that, you know, the Fed still only cares about the level of inflation. And so when gas prices go up and like other things related, like that drives inflation higher, and that might drive the Fed to more hawkish policy, which isn't necessarily what they do. But long story short, there's just so many variables at play. Like the United auto workers are at strike, and so labor has got a lot of power right now, and wages might be going up because we're in a structurally tight labor market which can.
00:04:41.734 - 00:04:43.494, Speaker A: Contribute positively to inflation. Right?
00:04:43.534 - 00:04:43.734, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:43.774 - 00:04:56.286, Speaker C: So we're in this weird dynamic of, we know things are slowing, nobody wants to buy a house right now, mortgages rates are super absurd. That I think is on the cusp of some.
00:04:56.430 - 00:04:58.054, Speaker A: Something to give. Yeah.
00:04:58.214 - 00:05:34.414, Speaker C: However, the data is still super strong. Right. But consumer is going to slow over time. Their savings are dwindling, credit card delinquencies are picking up, auto delinquencies are picking up, et cetera. So we've got to find the balance between knowing that that stuff is happening and the fact that the inflation metrics that the Fed's focused on haven't necessarily bottomed aren't anywhere close to where they need to be for the Fed to kind of ease. So it's really tough. And then you throw in just the fiscal side of things and it's just so insane.
00:05:34.414 - 00:06:03.916, Speaker C: Just the mountain of treasury supply every single day. Not every day, it's their settlement days. But you get treasury supply every Tuesday and Thursday on bills every mid month they're funding and treasuries and month end refunding. Then you've got the tips. There's so many. I was literally looking through a net maturity cash addition table the other day, but it's literally every settlement day. It's like, oh, here's another $15 billion in marginal, 10 billion there, 4 billion.
00:06:03.916 - 00:06:09.184, Speaker C: Like it just adds up over time. And the Fed isn't actively expanding its balance sheet right now.
00:06:10.804 - 00:06:32.142, Speaker A: But anyway, yeah, it is very complicated. I mean, your point that the economy easing should be supportive for inflation and thus supportive for rates to halt or eventually come down. But at the same time, other forces in the economy keeping inflation steady.
00:06:32.278 - 00:06:32.718, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:32.806 - 00:06:53.910, Speaker A: Like the tightening in the labor market, the housing market, the new, the consumer, the spending, that's the United auto workers is an example of like labor power on the labor side, negotiating power. Right. There's that. What's that metric of the average amount of money that like people would need to take a new job now. Right. Like they're, everyone's demanding more wages. Yeah.
00:06:53.942 - 00:07:02.046, Speaker C: The average, like shift, like job shifters, they actually pick up, I think around five to 6% increase in wages, which.
00:07:02.070 - 00:07:17.874, Speaker A: Is high on the historical super high. So it's tricky. And then when we think about, we have the government shutdown too. You're talking about the fiscal side. In addition to lots of spending there, we also have impasses which make effective governance more difficult.
00:07:18.574 - 00:07:26.438, Speaker C: It's so crazy. And then you throw in, I think, a banking system that just is not healthy.
00:07:26.526 - 00:07:27.502, Speaker A: It's stretched still.
00:07:27.558 - 00:07:39.446, Speaker C: It's stretched because what's happening is when we had the Silicon Valley signature banking crisis, we had it because all of these banks had all of these treasury securities and other long duration that just.
00:07:39.470 - 00:07:40.558, Speaker A: Went down in value.
00:07:40.646 - 00:07:42.358, Speaker C: They've gone further down in value and.
00:07:42.366 - 00:07:45.406, Speaker A: They couldn't hold them to maturity to get that liquidity back.
00:07:45.550 - 00:07:59.924, Speaker C: Well, they were going to get rushed by a run on them, so they put it on in this BTFB facility. But at this point, everybody is now realizing that that BTFP facility is permanent. The value of those securities is only.
00:08:00.224 - 00:08:03.256, Speaker A: It just has to hold them through maturity. Basically. There's no other option.
00:08:03.320 - 00:08:04.320, Speaker C: Well, that's.
00:08:04.352 - 00:08:05.392, Speaker A: How long is that?
00:08:05.568 - 00:08:11.404, Speaker C: Or interest rates need to come down and those assets increase cover in value. But that's not happening.
00:08:11.984 - 00:08:13.088, Speaker A: Not in hire for longer.
00:08:13.136 - 00:08:50.054, Speaker C: The Fed basically just created a new long term lending facility that's a permanent feature of the banking system because of just how twisted they got things by forcing banks to own all these treasuries, then hosing them because they created an inflation problem by not reacting aggressively enough. And so you're just in this weird situation and now there's a huge intense competition for deposits and that's crushing these bank margins and they're going to have to post more capital to operate. What does that mean? They're going to have to issue more debt.
00:08:51.034 - 00:08:52.354, Speaker A: It's a vicious cycle.
00:08:52.474 - 00:09:09.090, Speaker C: It's so bad. And the issue, I hate to blame regulators and the Fed because it's tough to put yourself in their shoes and to understand all the various dynamics happening, but for the BTFP, you could have.
00:09:09.122 - 00:09:12.154, Speaker A: Known, day one, the second you start hiking, you mean?
00:09:12.274 - 00:09:30.554, Speaker C: Well, no, well, the second you start hiking, yeah. I mean, they could have known about the banking crisis sooner rather than later, but not even that. But it's just the way that this facility was constructed. Like, you know, it wasn't the most honest at the beginning. Like, nobody told you that it was going to be a permanent feature of the banking system when they initially launched.
00:09:31.174 - 00:09:32.502, Speaker A: Emergency one year.
00:09:32.558 - 00:09:34.470, Speaker C: Emergency one year, we'll be fine.
00:09:34.582 - 00:09:36.262, Speaker A: No, yeah, tricky.
00:09:36.358 - 00:09:50.034, Speaker C: And so, and the other thing is just like, like, let's just be honest. The government can't afford four and a half, five, 6% interest rates at these levels of deficit.
00:09:50.074 - 00:09:54.922, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. There's all that stuff about the cost of servicing the national debt, the debt.
00:09:54.978 - 00:10:12.408, Speaker C: And it just keeps ballooning. And it's all like this market is fundamentally built on the premise that the money printer will just go brrrr. When necessary. And it's just such an absurd concept. And it's like the only reason you can do it. Cause everywhere else is even shittier.
00:10:12.536 - 00:10:13.644, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:10:13.944 - 00:10:22.168, Speaker C: That's realistically, that's what the whole essence of like the US financial system and the dollar monopoly, like right now come.
00:10:22.216 - 00:10:24.864, Speaker A: Down to is the lesser of all the evils.
00:10:24.944 - 00:10:32.456, Speaker C: Lesser of all the evils everywhere else, housing, affordability, they have the same problem. Same problem and worse and worse because they don't have the currency benefit.
00:10:32.520 - 00:10:51.456, Speaker A: Right. Right. It's tricky. And I always love talking with this. Let me shift gears just a little bit, because our guest this week, our guest this week is Lucas nudse from coinmetrics. We're talking a lot about crypto data. As a trader of crypto markets, like, how do you think about data? What types of data in crypto are very important to you?
00:10:51.480 - 00:11:17.752, Speaker C: Just types of data, funding data, open interest volumes, all the same metrics, all market data, stuff that are relevant to any marketplace. I think all markets are essentially identical. There's buyers and sellers. There's types of buyers and sellers. You have to figure out who's motivated to do what. There's options, positioning. Are people short, gamma, long, gamma volt, short volume, long volume.
00:11:17.848 - 00:11:18.080, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:18.112 - 00:11:34.336, Speaker C: Then there's the funding side. Are people paying a lot to be long or people paying a lot to be short? And then they're catalysts. But basically all markets in my head at least function on the same set of things. So I look at basically an identical kind of set of metrics.
00:11:34.480 - 00:11:49.232, Speaker A: What about, like on chain data? You have fundamental data, obviously, like at the macro level, you talk about a lot of that all the time. You obviously can look at individual companies. They have reporting schedules. But no, I mean, honestly, is it impactful to you that it's more real time transparent?
00:11:49.368 - 00:12:03.424, Speaker C: It's so much more impactful. I mean, you can literally see movements on chain from wallets that you track from great traders or from market makers or from venture people that you know are dumping. And so you can see their tokens going to exchange and being sold.
00:12:03.504 - 00:12:03.792, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:03.848 - 00:12:08.032, Speaker C: And so it's an un, like, transparency.
00:12:08.088 - 00:12:10.200, Speaker A: Tracing flows for you as a non chain thing.
00:12:10.232 - 00:12:25.796, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it's, I mean, it's great. Again, the question is, in the biggest asset in the space, bitcoin, it's not really that relevant to track the government. Wallets are really important, et cetera.
00:12:25.860 - 00:12:28.004, Speaker A: Miners maybe, but miners, but we know that.
00:12:28.084 - 00:12:40.756, Speaker C: Yeah, in things that are super macro, not necessarily important. If I told you I could track people's trading of euro dollar, such a huge, massive macro asset, which accounts doing what? I don't even know if there's a signal there.
00:12:40.820 - 00:12:50.726, Speaker A: Right. Just because it's such a big macro asset. So it's trading, bitcoin's trading more as a macro asset, more of a macro asset. But for a more crypto native flows the on chain stuff is useful.
00:12:50.830 - 00:12:52.142, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say yes.
00:12:52.238 - 00:12:52.654, Speaker A: Very interesting.
00:12:52.694 - 00:13:02.110, Speaker C: Or a $300 million defi token. Right. That's held. The top ten holders own, like, 30% of the stock.
00:13:02.142 - 00:13:03.862, Speaker A: Following that flow is really important.
00:13:03.958 - 00:13:29.782, Speaker C: That's more important in those instances. But, yeah, I mean, I think crypto analytics and on chain analytics, there's a ton of service providers out there that do a great job, and folks have tried to build signals off of it and stuff. And I think with anything else, it's really tough. And only a handful of people really figure out the secret sauce.
00:13:29.878 - 00:13:35.734, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Interesting. Bim Nadabibi from galaxy trading. My friend, as always, thanks for coming on galaxy brains.
00:13:35.854 - 00:13:36.634, Speaker B: Pleasure.
00:13:38.254 - 00:13:43.534, Speaker A: Let's go to my friend Lucas nutsy from coinmetrics. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains, Lucas. Great to have you here.
00:13:43.614 - 00:13:44.478, Speaker B: Likewise, Alex.
00:13:44.566 - 00:14:10.602, Speaker A: So the last time Lucas was here was. He wasn't actually here. We were remote, but he was on galaxy brains in November or December of last year, talking about FTX, because Lucas had done a lot of research to show money movement in and out of Alameda and FTX accounts. That was troubling. And we talked a lot about that. Have you kept following FTX? Is that saga, from a research standpoint, over. Finally, for you, at least on the.
00:14:10.618 - 00:14:25.794, Speaker B: On chain side, it seems to be over. But, yeah, that was a crazy three month period in our lives at CM, just because of the breadth of data and deception and the scale of flows.
00:14:25.834 - 00:14:30.234, Speaker A: That you were uncovering was just huge, just absolutely insane.
00:14:30.394 - 00:15:13.818, Speaker B: Billions and billions of dollars going to defi into other exchanges. I guess, like, one of the things that I found that I haven't really shared just yet are the other recipients of the FTT ICO. I did some work there because that's the whole reason why I found that 4 billion transaction from Alameda back to FTX that looked like a bailout was looking at the ICO recipients, and there are some other entities there that basically send funds to FTX, likely because of other deals that they did as they were seeing the situation on FTT.
00:15:13.906 - 00:15:14.314, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:15:14.354 - 00:15:18.362, Speaker B: Get progressively worse. So I'm excited about the court hearings.
00:15:18.418 - 00:15:48.294, Speaker A: Yeah, they start October 3. Sam's trial starts, and I'm told, although I haven't actually independently confirmed this, but people are saying Michael Lewis's FTX book apparently drops also October 30. So we're gonna have to read that very quickly. I think I'm gonna have to burn through that thing. So Lucas is head of R and D at coin metrics. So what are you researching and developing these days? What's interesting to you, what are the opportunities and challenges in crypto data?
00:15:48.414 - 00:16:43.248, Speaker B: Yeah, data in crypto is pretty tricky because it's almost like tracking within a single company an entire financial system. So we have both. Mostly we want to categorize things into two buckets. You have market data, which are prices, volume, things that are happening on centralized exchanges, and then you have the network data, which is where I focus the majority of my time. So looking at these actual ledgers and understanding how they're getting used, how these networks are getting used, supporting new assets, which is always a pretty tricky part of our process. But recently I've been taking a lot of, doing a lot of work around mining. There's been some interesting developments in mining as an industry post FTX collapse, and I think there are some interesting changes happening there.
00:16:43.248 - 00:16:57.022, Speaker B: And I think we're at this pivotal moment for mining as an industry. We recently released a new set of data looking at specific ASIC models and understanding the breakdown.
00:16:57.158 - 00:17:05.222, Speaker A: I love this data set. Let's talk about that real quick. So this stems out of Kareem Helmi's nonce analysis like obsession, I'm gonna call it.
00:17:05.278 - 00:17:06.134, Speaker B: It's an obsession.
00:17:06.214 - 00:17:28.770, Speaker A: It is the only one on earth that is obsessed. Well, but not anymore, because. So maybe you can explain what is the nonce analysis concept. By the way, how are you tagged? Basically, you're looking at hashrate, and actually you're looking at blocks that are mined, but based on how some quirks in the data, you can actually figure out and fingerprint which machine model. Mind it.
00:17:28.842 - 00:17:30.210, Speaker B: Yeah, which machine, how does that work?
00:17:30.242 - 00:17:32.714, Speaker A: What is the data? What is the nonce like? Explain this part to me.
00:17:32.754 - 00:17:57.834, Speaker B: So nonce is short for number used once. And the nonce is basically what bitcoin miners are trying to get when they're mining bitcoin. So the ASiCs, the machines that are highly specialized, used in the context of mining, they're trying to find a nonce that will meet some pattern that is required by the system. So you can actually include a block.
00:17:57.874 - 00:18:09.122, Speaker A: Which is the difficulty adjustment, basically, like they have to find. And I think the way bitcoin works to make it harder is actually just adds and removes leading zeros from the output that's required, whatever, to make it like infinitesimally larger, small number, basically.
00:18:09.178 - 00:19:05.604, Speaker B: Exactly. So, very clever system. If you need to find more zeros that in the beginning of that hash, then you have to have more compute power. And that's a way that bitcoin adjusts for more miners coming in, miners leaving, and Danos is that special? Number one analogy that I like to use is we think about mining, because mining as an industry, as a very human thousand year old activity, it replicates from an economic perspective like what bitcoin miners are doing. You're trying to allocate resources into this process. And if you're lucky and you have the right equipment, you're finding new bitcoins and you're rewarded for it, just like when you're mining for silver or gold. But mining, when it comes to the actual process of what's happening under the hood for these miners, it's not the best analogy.
00:19:05.604 - 00:19:45.746, Speaker B: I found that locksmithing is maybe a little bit better. So what miners are trying to find is basically a key to a lock that is locked, and they're competing to find the key that will unlock this lock. And that key is the nonce, because once a miner has allocated enough resources to unlock that lock, produce a key that unlocks that lock, and enables them to add a new block and lock it again to the blockchain. That key is the proof of work. They've actually went through the effort of producing that key, and they can share that with anyone that wants to verify. And it's very easy to just try and unlock this lock. And if you have the key, the lock will unlock.
00:19:45.746 - 00:19:57.026, Speaker B: So the nonce is really that key, and it's unique for every single block. And you can think about the ASICS as these metal grinders that these Miners are using to find these, but they.
00:19:57.050 - 00:20:37.712, Speaker A: End up having, even though certainly to the human eye, these hashes, these keys end up looking pretty randomized or whatever. Actually, what I think Kareem first discovered on the s nine s or whatever he first looked at them was that there's actually a pattern. Different machines tend to find certain types of nonces or something, right? And that with some kind of crazy big machine learning analysis, you can actually figure out those patterns. And for a long time, you guys have offered the data. Kareem worked at Quantum Metrics, where that's what he worked on when he was there for you, right? Yep. And you had that data for the s seven and the s nine, the ant miners, I think, right?
00:20:37.798 - 00:20:41.508, Speaker B: Yeah. And those were, you know, this stems from a lot of work.
00:20:41.596 - 00:20:48.468, Speaker A: You guys called it too. Like what, the ghost and the machine, too, because no one actually really understands why they're different, why there is a pattern. Right.
00:20:48.596 - 00:21:22.976, Speaker B: There are a couple of theories as to, like, why is it that each key and each block is different? And it was difficult to identify these patterns to begin with, because although we knew these patterns existed, it was hard to match a pattern with a specific machine. And, you know, back in, I think it was 2021, when we first released the first set of metrics around s seven s and s nine s, we knew the pattern had existed. It was initially this collaboration between Kareem, myself and Anton Lacove at CM.
00:21:23.040 - 00:21:23.632, Speaker A: Yep.
00:21:23.768 - 00:21:35.656, Speaker B: And we knew that depending on the ways that you would encode the nonce, you would find some interesting patterns that matched release dates for the s seven and s nine s. Oh, wow.
00:21:35.680 - 00:21:37.216, Speaker A: So that's how you started to realize.
00:21:37.280 - 00:21:43.800, Speaker B: Yeah. And just sourcing the nonsense on chain and basically matching that with when they first appear.
00:21:43.872 - 00:21:47.432, Speaker A: And when you knew then that a machine was released in the public.
00:21:47.528 - 00:21:48.152, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:21:48.248 - 00:21:49.752, Speaker A: Okay, well, you could see from that.
00:21:49.848 - 00:21:50.760, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:21:50.872 - 00:21:55.888, Speaker B: You know, it wasn't exactly when they released, because as we learned, pre mining or whatever.
00:21:55.936 - 00:21:58.528, Speaker A: Yeah. They test them. They test them before they send them.
00:21:58.536 - 00:22:31.912, Speaker B: Out live, sometimes for a little bit longer than they should have. So we found s seven s and s nine s. And then Kareem, because it is an obsession, continued that work. And he's found a really clever way that we had originally talked about at CM of how can you really expand the set of nonsense beyond the blocks that are being found on blockchain, on average every ten minutes. But how can you really expand, like, your training set so that you can have more models that might be a little bit.
00:22:31.968 - 00:22:36.856, Speaker A: I see, because there's, you know, 806,000 blocks, but that's not that big of a set.
00:22:36.920 - 00:22:37.264, Speaker B: It's not.
00:22:37.304 - 00:22:40.648, Speaker A: And by the way, like, the first five years of them are irrelevant. They're not even asics.
00:22:40.776 - 00:22:41.928, Speaker B: Yeah. They're computers.
00:22:41.976 - 00:22:42.640, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:42.752 - 00:23:04.328, Speaker B: And some of them also have patterns. Satoshi has left a pattern in some of the early blocks. But we found that, you know, Kareem actually implemented this and spent a ton of work on time on this. There are ways that you can just rent these asics and just sample them to the point that you have to.
00:23:04.336 - 00:23:06.368, Speaker A: Hash them a whole bunch and just see what comes out.
00:23:06.496 - 00:23:11.080, Speaker B: You expand the set of nonsense that are produced by that ASIC.
00:23:11.152 - 00:23:18.328, Speaker A: I see. So you look directly at the model's hashing rather than just the public data that becomes part of the blockchain.
00:23:18.496 - 00:23:31.800, Speaker B: And then you can connect the machines without just relying on things like release times, not because machines might be released concurrently. And this is a substantially better way of understanding that.
00:23:31.832 - 00:24:16.960, Speaker A: And so let's fast forward a little bit because I want to get to some of the really interesting takeaways for this. So doing this, coinmetrics and careem were now able to fingerprint basically all machines. And so now, which has a lot of interesting implications, but I think in some ways the most obvious one is, well, let's say you're in the ASIC manufacturing business. We can kind of see a real time and historical market share of all the models we can know, like how many of s 19s there are and how many s nine s there still are and how many what's minor whatever m 20 ss there are. Right? Like that's really interesting market data that does not exist in like other industries, right. There's no way you can just like real time see like every single person's gpu that's playing Call of Duty.
00:24:17.112 - 00:25:14.278, Speaker B: Exactly. It's really interesting, especially for hardware, right? Hardware you don't really have this common network that you can source data from and understand the predominance of specific machines. So I think that was fascinating in terms of understanding not only the differences in composition in the network and how kind of diverse it's getting from a model perspective, understanding for example, what it takes for a model to take off. And at times the XP, for example, took a little bit longer to become predominant and really just track, add a little bit more context to what's happening in mining right now. You had a lot of pools and constituents, individual mining operations changed their AsIcs restructure in the bear market. And you can see that happening and changing the composition of these machines.
00:25:14.326 - 00:25:26.430, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you found something where it's like say some big miner closed down some big site or got acquired by somebody or whatever, and you actually see probably while the Asics are being put on a truck, there's a decline in one specific. Have you noticed things like that?
00:25:26.502 - 00:26:16.994, Speaker B: Yeah, you can see that in the different aggregation windows. So we have, if you go to labs, coinmetrics, IO, you can see the breakdown of the machines, but we have different aggregation windows that we're testing with. And if you shorten the aggregation window, you can see the model becomes more sensitive. So you can see, for example, when there's a high likelihood that the, the biggest user of the XP has unplugged and it's probably because they're moving operations somewhere. So different aggregation windows enable you to see this. And we captured this, not only the migration from China back in 2021 where you had some models drop in usage and then pop back up, but even with this latest restructure in mining, you can see a similar effect happening.
00:26:17.144 - 00:26:56.442, Speaker A: So one of the other really interesting analyses and conclusions that you guys drew from this data, which is really fascinating, is a much more empirical assessment of bitcoin's total electricity usage. Energy usage, because you have Cambridge, the Center for Alternative Finance at Cambridge University, and theirs is what, based on polling, they literally ask some pools how much they're using or whatever, or what their hash rates are and where they are, and then they use the some like, it's not real. They don't actually have electricity information. They know this, they admit this.
00:26:56.498 - 00:26:57.202, Speaker B: They're very transparent.
00:26:57.218 - 00:27:03.482, Speaker A: And it's a very good. It's a very good data source, but it's. It's extrapolated, it's based on a bunch of assumptions, et cetera. Right.
00:27:03.538 - 00:27:04.690, Speaker B: It's the strap relation.
00:27:04.842 - 00:27:09.370, Speaker A: And then you obviously have like digiconomist, who. I don't know what his methodology is.
00:27:09.522 - 00:27:10.854, Speaker B: But I don't like the same.
00:27:12.154 - 00:27:40.484, Speaker A: He did say that it would use all of the world's energy by 2020. That obviously did not happen. But now you have a way, because you know the proportion of every model on the network at any given time historically. Well, we can also go look at the specs of the model. We know how much electricity it uses. Right. So now you can actually sum a much more accurate measure of how much electricity bitcoin is using, which I really, really like that they have.
00:27:40.484 - 00:28:04.860, Speaker A: Now we don't have to listen to these people making stuff up in the Netherlands or like Cambridge doing their best, but like, it's just sort of like a pole. It's not actually a data driven exercise. Now we have some hard data and that's, as you know, of course, that's one of the biggest, like, not just criticisms, but like issues around bitcoin and both in the. In the crypto world, but in the scientific community, in the climate community, in the mainstream. Right.
00:28:04.932 - 00:28:05.772, Speaker B: Everywhere. Yeah.
00:28:05.828 - 00:28:07.464, Speaker A: And now we actually have something real.
00:28:08.004 - 00:28:31.398, Speaker B: Although like the. One of the areas that I was most interested in was the breakdown of machines. I think the biggest impact of this data set is on the electricity consumption. First, because we had a varying degree of intellectual honesty in previous assumptions, I think Cambridge was very honest about the shortcomings of their model.
00:28:31.446 - 00:28:31.902, Speaker A: I agree.
00:28:31.998 - 00:28:33.774, Speaker B: Digital misses not. He was not.
00:28:33.814 - 00:28:39.726, Speaker A: And then you have the bitcoin mining council, which I think is honest, but is also a limited data set, limited dataset.
00:28:39.830 - 00:29:26.672, Speaker B: Now you can see, because now you have this composition of asics in a network from a much more precise perspective, what is actually the consumption. And what these other models really didn't take into account is the insane increase in efficiency that new machines have introduced. So if you're making blanket statements about hash efficiency, exactly how many hashes can you produced with the same unit of electricity? You're massively, really not taking into account the increase in efficiency that new models have introduced. And it has no signs of actually slowing down, which is fascinating to me.
00:29:26.688 - 00:29:55.144, Speaker A: Because, yeah, people were thinking, I remember hearing five years ago, smart people had a thesis that not all smart people, but some people who were smart and are still smart, thought that mining hardware would become commoditized quite shortly, that, like, actually there would essentially reach peak efficiency, and then the game would be played solely on opex and build outs and other ways to gain efficiency, even software. Right. But that's not the case.
00:29:55.184 - 00:30:54.774, Speaker B: They keep getting faster and faster, faster and faster. It's been really, even my expectations of marginal increases in efficiency was underestimating the speed through which these new miners and efficiency, the underlying electricity consumption that's taken to produce hashes, I think that was one of the biggest takeaways. And the ultimate impact of increases in efficiency, obviously, is less electricity at times. We're half, if you look at the actual machines on the network, it's half the consumption than what Cambridge, and certainly other less honest sources, less vision economists had estimated. And we think that this is really important, because there's a lot getting discussed right now around mining policy and using just bad data.
00:30:55.934 - 00:30:58.394, Speaker A: You just want the correct data.
00:30:59.734 - 00:31:29.698, Speaker B: And if you accept this increase in efficiency, and if you understand that this increase in efficiency continues to happen, it doesn't necessarily mean that as bitcoin grows and its security expands, that your consumption will increase accordingly. Your consumption can start tapering while efficiency and hash rate are still going up. And before, I think there was this mental model that when people were trying to reason about bitcoin's electricity consumption, that all these kind of move in tandem.
00:31:29.746 - 00:31:42.574, Speaker A: Which is some kind of linear relationship. It's really interesting data. Definitely check that out at labs. Coinmetrics IO. Let's talk about a couple other things here. I really did love that data, by the way. I'm so proud of Kareem for this was.
00:31:42.574 - 00:31:47.974, Speaker A: You're watching Kareem. I can't believe you pulled this off. After years of shilling this concept.
00:31:48.754 - 00:31:49.482, Speaker B: He's done it.
00:31:49.538 - 00:32:20.830, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very cool. But you also look at other stuff. Other stuff? What else? I mean, we're in a lot. There's more data, crypto data vendors and projects and block explorers and free websites than there has ever been before. What do you think of the state of crypto data. Is crypto data ready for the institutions? Are they coming? What level of quality and depth and analysis are we getting out of the crypto data world these days?
00:32:20.982 - 00:32:42.070, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been interesting because there was a lot of specialization that's happened in crypto data as well. And I think it's a factor that stems from the fact that you have a lot of different areas of interest in the industry. Even data providers are focusing on NFT markets.
00:32:42.142 - 00:32:43.994, Speaker A: Only NFT data, only NFT data.
00:32:44.884 - 00:33:56.398, Speaker B: Now we have new entrants that are looking at real world assets and specializing, and I think it stems from the fact that you have a ton of data. The transparency of these blockchains, the byproduct, that transparency is really a ton of different areas that you can start monitoring. But because our clients are mostly institutions, we have to be a little bit more careful allocating resources to things like nfTs, for example, because they're just, isn't a lot of demand for that type of data from that institutional perspective. But I think the state of crypto data today is a bit confusing because we really don't know what is going to happen market wise if these L2s that can be very difficult for data providers to integrate, will stick around. If projects that are even more challenging to support, like Solana, will have long term feasibility. Solana, for example, it produces more data in one day. That bitcoin produces an entire year, although that might change with ordinals getting more predominant in bitcoin.
00:33:56.398 - 00:34:52.704, Speaker B: So the decision of where to focus, I think has never been this challenging in the field of crypto data. But a lot of data providers are still around focusing on different areas. We tend to have a more conservative, quality oriented approach to our data strategy because of the expectations of our clients. That prevents us from going all in into new L2s. Time needs to elapse and the need to actually get real usership and interest for us to actually go and monitor them. But I would say that there are some areas that are not controversial at all and that we're focusing on. There's a lot in stablecoins today that folks are really interested in, and it's one of those rare intersections between what institutions are interested in and what the crypto native folks are interested in stablecoins.
00:34:52.704 - 00:35:12.454, Speaker B: So we're focusing a lot on not only expanding stablecoin coverage with new projects, but also thinking about additional data points that will be a requirement for stable coins. Like there are projects that are trying to basically tokenize treasuries and that entails yield, right.
00:35:12.494 - 00:35:14.750, Speaker A: How do you track a yield metric or whatever?
00:35:14.822 - 00:35:38.910, Speaker B: Yeah, it's almost like a new, it's almost like a new financial product in a lot of ways, because it's almost like you're tokenizing your deposit at a bank, in your checking accounts, and that unit is rebasing as you're getting more interest. So it entails, from a data perspective, a lot of challenges. But those are the areas that I think are less controversial that we need to focus on.
00:35:39.022 - 00:35:54.764, Speaker A: I think that makes a lot of sense. Stablecoins are objectively widely used, and they're interesting. They have some features that are very. That are better. They're not volatile. Typically. Well done, Wood.
00:35:54.764 - 00:36:13.276, Speaker A: Yeah. The good ones that function properly typically don't have price volatility, which is great. So it's like, it's money with wings. It's like dollars that you can send globally, right? I mean, I don't know if people have ever tried to send dollars to another country. It's very difficult. They're not on Venmo, they're not on cash app. I don't know why.
00:36:13.276 - 00:36:18.916, Speaker A: Apparently all those things are just national borders, basically. Well, I do know why it's jurisdictional. Right.
00:36:19.100 - 00:36:20.464, Speaker B: There's a huge issue.
00:36:20.884 - 00:36:41.684, Speaker A: Public blockchains are global. Of course. They're typically collateralized. I would be interested to see, as you guys build out, too, there's a wide variety of how they're collateralized. If treasury is off chain, one thing, but then you got maker, which is all on chain, and then you got fracs, which is what? Half collateralized. They're quite different.
00:36:41.844 - 00:37:22.126, Speaker B: Yeah. Testing different models for stablecoins now. And I think the toughest part of understanding stablecoins and even around their coverage is that use case, is it actually getting used for payments? Because if so, the metrics that you use to contextualize stablecoins is different. What is the actual underlying use case for a stablecoin? In DeFi, it does get used quite frequently as a stable store of value because you might not want to rely on your local banking system to actually get fiat. That's less volatile than on and off ramps.
00:37:22.150 - 00:37:25.222, Speaker A: In and out of crypto could be difficult, very difficult.
00:37:25.398 - 00:37:46.702, Speaker B: But some preliminary data, and we've written about stablecoins quite a lot, but a big one is as a collateral type, because it's a stable form of collateral, and you can get leverage in a risk minimized way. And that's one of the ironies of crypto at this stage.
00:37:46.838 - 00:38:02.198, Speaker A: Bitmex. Right. Bitmex. Didn't. You could only post bitcoin as collateral for most of its existence back in the day, which was tricky for people to manage. Who traded there? I never traded there or anything. But because you get your actual position that you're collateralizing, which could be volatile.
00:38:02.246 - 00:38:04.622, Speaker B: Which usually leverage bitcoin or something like.
00:38:04.638 - 00:38:30.488, Speaker A: That, or some altcoin you were trading, it's moving, you're managing that risk, but also the structural value of your underlying collateral is volatile. And by the way, in crypto, a lot of times that was highly correlated moves too. So you could lose money on your position at the same time as your collateral value is dropping and have to scramble. So I think, I don't know. But almost all those exchanges have changed to stablecoin collateralization for that reason.
00:38:30.616 - 00:39:03.422, Speaker B: But you can do a lot in, in defi, frankly, with stablecoins, because as a stable unit of accounts, you have fixed ltvs. You don't have to think about your LTV anymore, to the point where you get. We'll see if this happens with bitcoin too. It's uncomfortable, but bitcoin is the third largest collateral type in defi. If you think about all those, basically.
00:39:03.478 - 00:39:06.142, Speaker A: What rap bitcoin and other versions of.
00:39:06.158 - 00:39:29.902, Speaker B: That, TBC mostly, yeah. Wrapped bitcoin. But it does function as one of these a few areas in the industry beyond trust, minimize currencies and stores of value like bitcoin. One of the few applications that have actually gotten product market fit at this point is what?
00:39:29.998 - 00:39:33.878, Speaker A: On chain leverage and lending. You mean like collateralized lending, basically collateralized.
00:39:33.926 - 00:40:00.980, Speaker B: Lending, yeah, especially with stable coins, because then your liquidations are fixed and you can get leverage in a much more, in a much safer way. And that's kind of this irony of defi as it exists today. Right. Its main value proposition is risk management, because you don't need to rely on like a 400 page contract to an interpretation of that contract to move collateral around.
00:40:01.012 - 00:40:05.052, Speaker A: And you can be pretty sure exactly how it's gonna play out under different scenarios.
00:40:05.108 - 00:40:05.980, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:40:06.052 - 00:40:13.740, Speaker A: You may have no leeway if you need it, but you'll know for certain that you don't have that leeway, so you can prepare for it. Right. Or whatever.
00:40:13.852 - 00:40:41.792, Speaker B: That's exactly right. And think about it from a cost perspective, too. If you were to, executing these contracts in the real world and rely on court systems is incredibly costly and tough to navigate a lot of times, depending on your jurisdiction. In crypto, that's a lot simpler. And I'm excited. I'm an optimist, especially with regards to bitcoin. We'll see what starts coming to bitcoin on that front.
00:40:41.848 - 00:41:16.884, Speaker A: Let's talk about that a little bit too, because you mentioned ordinals before also, and I think it's fair to say there's a bit of a culture clash happening in bitcoin. I still think the monetary maximalists, the digital gold crowd is the dominant culture in bitcoin. But probably like never before, or at least not for many years, there is a resurgence of bitcoin as a platform for building other things. You've got ordinals, which I think at its base layer, most people think of as nfts, but actually the vast majority of ordinals were weird token things. BRC twenties.
00:41:16.924 - 00:41:17.778, Speaker B: Right, brcs.
00:41:17.876 - 00:41:23.806, Speaker A: Then you also have drive chains. Big debate about drive chains. I don't know if you have a take on drive chains.
00:41:23.990 - 00:41:24.502, Speaker B: I do.
00:41:24.558 - 00:41:35.542, Speaker A: Okay, I'll give it to you. 1 second. And then just to round this out here, there's also a lot of people trying to build roll ups on bitcoin. So let's rather than attack that entire question, what is your take on drive chains, by the way?
00:41:35.718 - 00:41:40.870, Speaker B: Drive chains. I've been following Paul's work for a really, really long time.
00:41:40.902 - 00:41:43.802, Speaker A: He published these bibs, what, in 2017?
00:41:43.958 - 00:41:47.466, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a while ago, or maybe 26.
00:41:47.530 - 00:41:50.334, Speaker A: I mean, these are five or six year old proposals.
00:41:51.074 - 00:42:39.904, Speaker B: They're old. And I think it's been discussed quite frequently, even back then, in terms of their feasibility. I think now that there is kind of this cultural bifurcation in bitcoin of where is the protocol going from now. I think it's gaining more traction and a lot of context is required here. We had this whole conversation around thing, CTV and its activation, and that was very traumatizing, even for, like, Jeremy to go through and kind of the tail end of that, you have this conversation around drive chains. I think one lesson that kind of blew my mind around ordinals is around unintended consequences. Right.
00:42:39.904 - 00:43:10.476, Speaker B: What I consider one of the smartest people in the world worked a ton on tap roots and really didn't see how loosening what you could actually encode in the witness, the signature part of a transaction would that would actually be used in the wild. And that although when Arden was launched, people thought that it was the end, you could not run a node anymore.
00:43:10.620 - 00:43:12.660, Speaker A: Yeah. Which didn't end up being true, but.
00:43:12.692 - 00:43:16.636, Speaker B: Yes, is not the case whatsoever. We've modeled that out.
00:43:16.700 - 00:43:37.838, Speaker A: And your point is that when Taproot was activated in the chains. Yes. They relaxed the limits on how much data, they removed the limits, I believe, on how much data you could put in the witness section of the transaction. And then along with Segwit, which also makes any data you put there less expensive, that they. You mean that they didn't realize that this would happen, right?
00:43:37.886 - 00:43:41.886, Speaker B: Yeah. Or that it would get used for the community.
00:43:41.990 - 00:43:48.510, Speaker A: The bitcoin broadly community was caught completely off guard by this Casey Rotomore, like, dropped this bomb. Nobody knew it was coming.
00:43:48.622 - 00:43:50.542, Speaker B: It was like, I think it's actually.
00:43:50.598 - 00:44:12.590, Speaker A: Quite bearish for future bips in general. Like, the fact that, like, there weren't, like, again, not every person can be expected to have the technological capability to review these types of proposals. But so you rely on, like, the smart developers to talk about it and you can participate and certainly follow the conversation and debate. And it didn't come up once.
00:44:12.742 - 00:44:14.070, Speaker B: It did not. It did not.
00:44:14.182 - 00:44:22.670, Speaker A: And I think, frankly, if you had told bitcoiners, upgraded taproot, and we'll get, like, never ending nfts on bitcoin, they would have broadly opposed it, like, absolutely.
00:44:22.702 - 00:44:52.864, Speaker B: And I think it was done very quiet. It was a little bit of a secret. I shouldn't say. I shouldn't use the word secret, but it was only for the astute observers that were looking at this loosening of the rules that questioned this design decision. Like, why would you even do it? And based on some conversations that I've had, the reason was they were future proofing for new proof sizes. They thought, oh, maybe there is a way that you can put a zero knowledge proof on bitcoin.
00:44:53.024 - 00:45:06.454, Speaker A: Maybe there are novel, like music and these other weird new tap script things, signature aggregation. There's, all of you need more space in there for weird crypto things, for cryptography, things that were not cat pictures, valid.
00:45:07.554 - 00:45:09.978, Speaker B: Long and behold. What was that used for?
00:45:10.026 - 00:45:10.850, Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
00:45:10.962 - 00:45:51.074, Speaker B: It's nfTs. Right. So I think there are unintended and unpredictable consequences that shouldn't be dismissed. I think both with CTV and, and with drive chains, I am. I am more pro CTV. And there was even a blog post I think has been retracted, but on how one could implement drive chains using CTV. But I think in my view, because of these unintended consequences, because the ultimate end result of drive chains would just be more tokens and more tokens.
00:45:51.074 - 00:46:25.720, Speaker B: Although I'm not saying that there's no value in tokenization, I'm not making that more maxi article comment. I think there is a lot of interesting use cases, as we just discussed on tokenization. It would take a long time for bitcoin to replicate a lot of these more defi tokenization use cases to the point where that might not be the best use of our time and resources, given that there are potential for unintended circumstances.
00:46:25.872 - 00:46:49.990, Speaker A: I hear you. I think that's a very fair take and way to think about it. Drive chains are merged mind side chains, essentially minor, custodied. And that have what? 301 has a peg in and out mechanism built into that. It can mess with mining economics. There could be unintended question. I mean, I think this was Casey.
00:46:49.990 - 00:47:17.434, Speaker A: Casey made this point really well, actually. Was that I thought in a way that I finally really understood the risk, this part of the risk, which was that it creates just other externalities. And miners start, by the way, you get really good at it. It's like Mev. It's like MeV in that you centralize. And we're seeing this on Ethereum now, which is the verticalization of block building. And Mev, like all the best block builders are doing the MeV themselves, right.
00:47:17.434 - 00:47:44.984, Speaker A: It's not. The flashbots thing isn't working exactly as intended. It is making it so that anyone can do Mev. But who's the best at it? Who can hire all the devs to come up with new algos and find the strategies, right? And the same kind of thing could happen here. And again, I'm not even sure if it's that bad, but I. I'm unsure. There's a pretty big unintended outcome possibly that could be dramatic.
00:47:45.444 - 00:47:46.308, Speaker B: I think this.
00:47:46.356 - 00:47:48.388, Speaker A: I don't know if it's bad. It's just something, though.
00:47:48.556 - 00:47:58.892, Speaker B: I think you hit the nail on the head. I think this would really bring in some novel Mev strategies to Bitcoin that I don't think we're ready for just yet.
00:47:58.948 - 00:48:18.550, Speaker A: Yeah. Eric Wall made this point really well, too. And I think Bitcoin 2023 is one of my favorites for him. And Udi's tapper wizards thing, where they had Shinobi and Matt Corralo there too, as like the anti. Although they were all pretty reasonable, I thought, but pretty funny. But he said that bitcoin developers have no effing idea. He said, how to do anything related to Mev.
00:48:18.550 - 00:48:32.314, Speaker A: Ethereum communities spent the last five years trying to mitigate it and remove it from the protocol. We don't know anything about it. He's like, we're completely unprepared for if that were to happen. Like what to do bitcoin, well, they'd have to go and learn from the Ethereum community.
00:48:32.654 - 00:48:33.394, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:34.254 - 00:48:35.934, Speaker A: Bitcoiners are loath to do that.
00:48:36.054 - 00:49:03.186, Speaker B: Yeah. Because you can think about the block wars as a war around MeV, right? I think. I wouldn't say that bitcoin developers don't really understand MeV. I think the definition of MeV is obviously very different for bitcoin than it is for Ethereum. One simple way of thinking about it is in Ethereum, the transactions in the block are executed sequentially.
00:49:03.250 - 00:49:03.962, Speaker A: The order matters.
00:49:04.018 - 00:49:34.684, Speaker B: The order matters absurdly, right? It's everything. Whereas in bitcoin, everything is atomic. Either all of them execute at once or none of them execute at all. So there are different ways that miners can extract value if they're trying to do MeV in bitcoin. MEV was actually born in bitcoin. The first MeV project was via BTC's transaction accelerator. I think they launched back in 2014.
00:49:34.684 - 00:49:49.592, Speaker B: And if you broadcast a transaction back then and you got stuck and you didn't do RBF, the recipient couldn't do child pays for parent. Like, two mechanisms that you can expedite the settlement of a transaction. You could go on their website. I think you can still do that.
00:49:49.648 - 00:49:51.224, Speaker A: I think you could like pay with a credit card.
00:49:51.264 - 00:49:52.152, Speaker B: You pay with a credit card.
00:49:52.168 - 00:49:55.032, Speaker A: You literally give the mining pool money and they just include it. Yeah.
00:49:55.168 - 00:50:52.774, Speaker B: That is a way of extracting value with. And if you look at their block templates, over time, they always have less transaction fees than others because they are also accepting transactions so called out of band. So I think Mev has existed in bitcoin. If you think about the block size wars, miners were pro increasing the block size because they saw that as an opportunity to extract more value. And in a lot of ways, user activated softworks are the ultimate weapon against MeV. And it is a very much bitcoin culture aspect. So I think bitcoin developers, I think they're familiar with this kind of division of powers, is just they don't understand from a product and use case perspective how these things materialize.
00:50:52.774 - 00:51:04.520, Speaker B: I think maybe that's what Eric meant, because they're not really tuned into the ethereum ecosystem where these things tend to appear first. Right. Things like Defi.
00:51:04.632 - 00:51:18.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I think he just means they're behind base. It's not that they can't understand it, it's that they haven't been following it. And they've learned a lot of lessons in ethereum for the different ways they've tried to mitigate it and see how it's played out. There's a lot to be learned there.
00:51:18.512 - 00:51:29.762, Speaker B: A ton. And it's interesting too, because in a lot of ways it starts, there was this meme back in the day that litecoin was bitcoin's testnet.
00:51:29.818 - 00:51:30.534, Speaker A: Oh yeah.
00:51:30.834 - 00:51:36.970, Speaker B: No. Silver to bitcoin is gold. Testnet, BTC, ethereum is bitcoin's testnet.
00:51:37.082 - 00:51:46.850, Speaker A: Yeah. Especially if we start to see roll ups and stuff emerge on bitcoin, then it really will be like we waited until you guys finally came up with the ZK roll up and now we're going to implement it.
00:51:46.922 - 00:51:49.402, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. And by the way, I think if.
00:51:49.418 - 00:51:59.432, Speaker A: You think about large projects, it building ZK rollups using sovereign rollup style. Kazar Labs and Chainway both are planning to release a bitcoin ZK roll up.
00:51:59.488 - 00:52:16.240, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm following those projects. It's all about, I think, how do you connect them to the chain that's a little bit more controversial? And are they actually, could actual users have some assurances of bitcoin security being applicable to that?
00:52:16.312 - 00:52:33.892, Speaker A: That's a little trickier, especially with. No, I mean, this is why I think 301, the drive chains is two bps. The second one is a trustless peg in, peg out mechanism. I don't actually like that mechanism. He's designed much personally either, but again, he sees that need as well.
00:52:33.988 - 00:53:15.798, Speaker B: Exactly. And I think directionally I think we should embrace these ideas. We can disagree about implementations, but I think just to dismiss them and say, oh, I don't want to see any shitcoins on bitcoin. I think it's really undermining a lot of the value proposition that we've seen emerge in things like Ethereum as it relates to lending, as it relates to actually not trusting a third party to custody your bitcoins, which wrapped bitcoin, the third largest collateral type in Ethereum, is really just a big third party that's holding it and doing more without really losing custody, which is, I think a.
00:53:15.806 - 00:53:43.344, Speaker A: Very cyberpunk kind of thing to it is. I really agree. I love bitcoin and I want to use my bitcoin more. It doesn't mean I want to buy cat jpegs necessarily, but who knows? I would like to. I want bitcoin to be more full featured. Another thing people point out a lot is we want things like privacy, better privacy in the world. By the way, I don't even mean on bitcoin like privacy is a multi generational battle that has been being fought and will continue to be to be fought.
00:53:43.344 - 00:54:08.820, Speaker A: I actually had an FBI agent on this show, Chris Tarbell and a former FBI agent. And I asked him this question about the battle between Apple and the FBI during the San Bernardino shooter thing and then the clipper chip in the nineties and how it's the same battle just constantly being fought. I was like, are we destined? I asked him if we were destined to fight this battle against government forever, and he said, I hope so. He's like, cause I hope they don't win. He's like, we deserve to have this.
00:54:08.932 - 00:54:09.268, Speaker B: Anyway.
00:54:09.316 - 00:54:20.284, Speaker A: Point being is it doesn't even have to be altcoins that get built on bitcoin. It could be a privacy l two could be a. There's uses that we should be able to play around with. I would like, personally.
00:54:20.364 - 00:55:28.154, Speaker B: Yeah, I would, too. And if you think about this concept of Ethereum as bitcoins tests that in Ethereum, I think it was during the Byzantium upgrade of 2018, they introduced an opcode that verifies zero knowledge proofs, right? It's kind of tested in the wild multiple times. We're now seeing ZK rollups being launched on Ethereum, testing these different functionalities. There are a few projects that are looking at the privacy, because ZK rollups you can use for both privacy reasons and efficiency reasons can batch validation of transactions. And that tends to be a lot more of an ethereum use case, because scalability is critical there. But privacy, you're absolutely right. I think if we think long term and beyond, just very use case driven proposals like drive chains, and think about ZK rollups that could be used for privacy, scalability, composability, functionality, all these different things jammed into one.
00:55:28.154 - 00:55:54.078, Speaker B: I think it's a lot more interesting because the only thing that this new hypothetical opcode would be doing is just validate something from the outside on chain, which is, I think, a lot more scalable, and it does limit what actually happens. You don't have to actually change any sort of scripting within bitcoin itself. It's just really a validation mechanism.
00:55:54.166 - 00:56:24.458, Speaker A: Yep, it's gonna be exciting. Before we wrap, one last question. You've been in crypto quite a long time. As, as have I. Where are we in this long bear cycle, bear market? How are, how, how are you thinking about really, as a longtime bitcoiner, crypto, uh, researcher, analyst? Like, how are you staying? Not cynical. And, and, I mean, there's a lot of interesting stuff happening, and maybe that's the answer, but where, where did, what does it feel like to you?
00:56:24.626 - 00:56:53.126, Speaker B: This is probably the most painful. I remember the aftermath of Sokrote shutting down, where to be involved in bitcoin was to be a criminal, like in the public eye, you know, still there was a strong cohort of people that believed in peer to peer markets and freedom. You know, 2017 was a wild year. Like you had. The proliferation of icos went really from.
00:56:53.150 - 00:56:56.158, Speaker A: Like $600 bitcoin to $20,000 bitcoin that year.
00:56:56.246 - 00:57:00.532, Speaker B: Exactly. The aftermath of all these projects collapsing.
00:57:00.588 - 00:57:09.964, Speaker A: Lots of scam icos and stuff, even ones that weren't scams also, many of them failed. Right. I mean, a huge, like, it was like a huge burning hot and then fading.
00:57:10.004 - 00:57:41.136, Speaker B: Right, exactly. And then you always kind of default back to, you know, why the hell does this technology exist and excite you? And I think this bear market has been particularly painful because now I think the previous bull was when crypto went mainstream, really. And it went mainstream maybe for very bad reasons, at least, like the perpetrators of the collapses and even like the.
00:57:41.160 - 00:58:07.794, Speaker A: Wide adoption at the time, too. It wasn't for necessarily the core things that we know make it core value. Right. It was jpegs. It was just pure naked speculation, like casino type game in the scheme of things. Right. Unfortunately, we didn't really explain to the millions of people that came in to Jimmy Fallon on tv holding up his NFT.
00:58:07.794 - 00:58:23.608, Speaker A: He had an NFT. Couldn't tell you a single thing about why decentralization matters. That's what really was sad about it to me in retrospect, was it was a mania, but we didn't. And of course, we've got more. We did bring in more true believers. That cohort is growing. It never stops growing.
00:58:23.696 - 00:58:49.032, Speaker B: The user base, by any metric has drastically increased. I think the challenge is on the use case front. What is it that we're solving at this point? And I think we're at the Max Payne stage. It is, I think, going to be very painful even, like going into the halving if prices don't really recuperate as things go.
00:58:49.048 - 00:58:53.296, Speaker A: Yeah, painful for miners potentially as well for miners.
00:58:53.360 - 00:59:31.494, Speaker B: I think for a lot of these newer projects that may be raised and are kind of extending their runways, like layer one, L2s that are coming through. So I think there's still some pain ahead, but I think there's still, I always go back to this cohort of users that have been around for a while that understand this technology from a really deep perspective and that understand how it's going to be important moving into the future as a fundamental sovereign technology.
