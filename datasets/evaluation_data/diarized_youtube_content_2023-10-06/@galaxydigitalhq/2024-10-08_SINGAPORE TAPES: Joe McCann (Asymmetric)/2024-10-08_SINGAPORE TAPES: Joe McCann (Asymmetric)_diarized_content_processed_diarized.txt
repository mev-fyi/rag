00:00:00.720 - 00:00:02.193, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:00:02.289 - 00:00:04.281, Speaker B: An infinite amount of cash. Cash.
00:00:04.433 - 00:00:10.985, Speaker A: I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high.
00:00:11.145 - 00:00:11.985, Speaker B: If you're not long.
00:00:12.065 - 00:00:13.697, Speaker A: If you're not long, you're short.
00:00:13.881 - 00:00:22.205, Speaker B: Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet. All bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto out there.
00:00:22.865 - 00:00:44.179, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to zero. Welcome back to Galaxy Brains. As always, I'm your host Alex Thorne, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. And this is the Singapore T. We are on the ground at Token 2049 in Singapore and I've got some great interviews lined up. First we're going to Talk with Joe McCann, founder and CIO of Asymmetric. Joe is very big in the Solana ecosystem.
00:00:44.179 - 00:01:16.915, Speaker A: I think people may have, may remember his involvement with Bonk, which is the fancy fun meme coin on Solana, sort of the OG meme coin on Solana. He has a lot of really good ideas, I think, about how to think about Solana's impact in the crypto ecosystem and the sort of interplay between soul and other assets, as well as a bunch of other fun things. So it's a great conversation. Before we get to that, I need to remind you to please refer to a link to the disclaimer in the podcast notes. And note that none of the information this podcast constitutes investment advice or an offer recommendation, solicitation by Galaxy or any of its affiliates to buy or sell any securities. Let's hop right in. Interview with Joe.
00:01:16.915 - 00:01:20.895, Speaker A: Joe McCann, CEO, founder of Asymmetric.
00:01:21.015 - 00:01:21.463, Speaker B: That's right.
00:01:21.519 - 00:01:26.583, Speaker A: With a bunch of interesting things going on, some of which he will wait for a bigger podcast than mine to announce.
00:01:26.719 - 00:01:27.591, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:27.663 - 00:01:37.735, Speaker A: Welcome. Thank you for coming on Galaxy Brains. You know, I, I, we just had Dan held on the podcast and I presume one of those venture funds is the bitcoin. The Asymmetric Bitcoin Defi Venture Fund.
00:01:37.775 - 00:01:38.303, Speaker B: That's right.
00:01:38.399 - 00:01:42.951, Speaker A: What's your, Kick it right off here. What is your bitcoin defi thesis?
00:01:43.103 - 00:01:55.121, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, so I, I've known Dan for a while. I think everybody knows Dan. He's been a bitcoin advocate and OG for 13 years, I think. And he sold, I think his company.
00:01:55.153 - 00:02:02.601, Speaker A: Was called Zero Block was one of the first things he did in the space. It was like the easiest place to check the price of bitcoin.
00:02:02.673 - 00:02:03.073, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:02:03.129 - 00:02:05.233, Speaker A: Yeah, he sold, Maybe was a blockchain.com at the time.
00:02:05.249 - 00:02:06.225, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Yeah.
00:02:06.265 - 00:02:07.937, Speaker A: And that was. That was a long. That was more than 10 years ago.
00:02:07.961 - 00:02:24.795, Speaker B: Yeah, that was a long time. I mean, look, so Dan. Dan is not only obviously a huge bitcoin advocate, but he's also an entrepreneur. He's really smart about marketing and communications and also understanding, you know, I would say, broader technological trends. Right. I mean, clearly he was super early to bitcoin. Right.
00:02:24.795 - 00:02:38.995, Speaker B: My thesis is very consistent with his. And so I've known him for a long time. Back in 2023, when, you know, the kind of. Was it January 2023 when Casey launched?
00:02:39.735 - 00:02:44.630, Speaker A: I think technically the first ordinal was printed like mid December 2022, so.
00:02:44.733 - 00:02:46.223, Speaker B: But around 23.
00:02:46.279 - 00:02:46.689, Speaker A: Yep.
00:02:46.767 - 00:03:25.161, Speaker B: So the thing about my thesis has been effectively that wherever developers can actually build stuff, like, they're going to gravitate towards that. And so I had been of the belief for a long time that developers should and will build on top of bitcoin. And Muneeb, who's a friend, did a great job with stacks. Like, I think that was like, probably the big first implementation. They have really good user experience and developer experience and SDKs, et cetera. However, we hadn't had sort of a proliferation of developer platforms that could exist on top of bitcoin. And so with ordinals, I think it opened the eyes to developers for the first time.
00:03:25.161 - 00:03:59.571, Speaker B: Like, wait a second, there's like this other way of doing things that can open up the potential for expression of applications that typically wouldn't be available on bitcoin. Dan reached out to me kind of later that year and he was like, yeah, man, I'm thinking about doing my fun. And I was like, go for it, dude. Like, you're this. You're primed for this. We share the exact same perspective. And then, you know, about six months later, it was like December of last year, he came to me and he's like, man, I spoke with like 50 VCs and like, you're the only guy I really want to work with and we should do this or I want to do a fund.
00:03:59.571 - 00:04:39.113, Speaker B: And I was like, why don't we do a fund at Asymmetric, you know, because I'm seeing the same thing you are. I don't have the bandwidth to actually dedicate and focus on what I think is going to be one of the biggest kind of sectors of growth within crypto in general, which is going to be called Bitcoin, L2, DeFi meta protocols, et cetera. And so he joined the firm at the beginning of this year. We Raised a bunch of money and we've deployed into a number of really killer projects. And it has a lot to do with obviously Dan's network, his connectivity in the space. But then he also benefits from what we do at Asymmetric. So more than half the company are former exited founders, we are half the company are software developers.
00:04:39.113 - 00:05:03.027, Speaker B: So we have a lot of kind of technical due diligence and rigor where Dan is technical, but he's not a technologist. Right. And so as these kind of deals come to our desk, so to speak, you know, Dan obviously has a pulse on this stuff. But then when we go through, we have a pretty militant due diligence framework. When we go through it, we can actually add that capability. Whereas he could have done his own fund. Right.
00:05:03.027 - 00:05:08.231, Speaker B: But then he's going to have to start from scratch. We kind of had all the infrastructure in place and so it just made sense for us to do it together.
00:05:08.303 - 00:05:49.235, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really interesting, the bitcoin. I like the way, I'm not sure what to call it exactly, but the some call it the Bitcoin renaissance. I know like an UDI and Eric like to call it Bitcoin season two, whatever it is. This. There has absolutely been a resurgence of developer interest. And it's funny to me because I've known a lot of bitcoin developers and builders for a long time and bitcoin script is very difficult to write, to deal with. And so watching the application developer realize that sort of on Ethereum and other smart contract generalized blockchains, they're designed for the developers, but on bitcoin the developers have to kind of bend the knee to the complexities and rigidness of bitcoin.
00:05:49.235 - 00:06:01.779, Speaker A: And they are, people are building all types of weird stuff that hasn't even now with the roll ups that people are trying to build. It's almost like bitcoin development culture doubled or tripled in just the last 18 months.
00:06:01.827 - 00:06:38.789, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, I've had a kind of hypothesis for 16 years at this point. I've been in tech for a long time, been in trading and finance for a long time. But you know, I've tracked open source developer communities since 2008. You know, I've been on GitHub since 2008. Like I'm old, I've been doing this a long time. And one of the key things that I have kind of identified as it relates to a new open source technology is how much friction is involved at the developer experience level. And if you have a lot of friction by definition, fewer developers are going to adopt it.
00:06:38.789 - 00:07:12.899, Speaker B: Furthermore, if they have to learn a new programming language or there's a whole new set of tools or something, or if the programming language is incredibly obtuse or kind of difficult to do, a Turing complete application, you're just going to struggle. For example, JavaScript is probably arguably a suboptimal programming language. It was invented in 10 days. It is the most widely adopted and used programming language on the planet. So like, why is that the case? It's super fucking easy to use. Right. And of course now there's 30 years of experience on the Internet with JavaScript, et cetera, et cetera.
00:07:12.899 - 00:07:42.625, Speaker B: Point that I'm getting to is that if a new open source technology comes out and the kind of shepherds of the project are not necessarily focused on removing friction for developers, it will struggle. And you start to see this. You know, Ethereum initially was the first smart contract platform. Amazing. But they created a new programming language. Well, it's not a hard programming language to learn, but now you have to. What about all the tooling and the testing and security best practices and all these things that come with it? If you look at something like Solana, it's written in Rust.
00:07:42.625 - 00:07:58.467, Speaker B: Is Rust a smart contract specific programming language? No, but it's a battle tested systems language with tons of developers, tons of, you know, tooling, best practices, et cetera. And you can see developers flock to that faster than having to learn an entirely new stack.
00:07:58.531 - 00:08:03.691, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. And they have had to build an entire stack around it for solidity and the evm.
00:08:03.763 - 00:08:04.535, Speaker B: That's right.
00:08:04.875 - 00:08:31.943, Speaker A: Let's talk about that. I mean, because I think it's a good transition. One of the things that I have seen from you on social media over the last few years, you're very pro Solana and you were very loudly advocating for Solana when people still thought it was dead post ftx. How do you think about Solana's place in the first question, I guess versus Ethereum as the sort of two leading layer one, blockchains for generalized smart contracts.
00:08:31.999 - 00:09:20.885, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean so I've been, like I said, I've been in software and technology for 24 years. I've seen a lot of patterns that exist from Web one, Web two cloud computing, thin clients, fat clients, you know, monolithic service oriented architecture. I've seen all of these things before and there is no like perfect way of building tech. However, there are trade offs that can affect, I think the long term potential of a particular technology. So if you look at something Like Solana, they come from a first principles perspective that's just fundamentally different than the evm. It's a parallelized, you know, state management where you can have transactions execute in parallel. It's not that wild of a concept because this pattern has existed in compute for the past 30 years.
00:09:20.885 - 00:10:15.517, Speaker B: You know, once we started to add parallelization to CPUs, you could run more than one application on your Windows machine, right? Like back in the day, you could run one application, right? Now you open up your laptop and you've got a 50 different applications running. It's common. Like you would not think that you would not be able to do that. Well, that's because parallelization became a thing in compute, right? So I saw this with Salon, I was like, this is literally what compute is like, or using computers. And like, why is this not super obvious to everybody? Because when I looked at Ethereum, I was blown away by it because it is a leap in computer science, smart contract programming, but it was designed as a kind of single threaded state machine. And we all know the kind of challenges that come with that. To me, I never thought that even in 2019 that this thing would actually be able to handle a global scale of users when it's single threaded.
00:10:15.517 - 00:11:02.295, Speaker B: Because I've seen this in tech before, right? It wasn't like, to me it didn't seem that controversial, but you know, the Internet, man. Whoa, what are you talking about, dude? Ethereum is the future of everything. I think that there are specific use cases that make sense for Ethereum. I mean, the way that Ethereum is actually designed at the programming language level is that you actually need, as a developer, optimize for as few lines of code as possible because it costs gas. Well, that is a fundamentally different construct for how developers write software, period. They don't think about the number of lines of code and I need to reduce them because it's going to cost money or whatever the effect may actually be. Whereas Solana, none of that exists because it's so cheap, right? And so I started to just like add this up and look at it and go, okay, yes, Ethereum was first hugely computer science.
00:11:02.295 - 00:11:33.831, Speaker B: Every VC in America is behind this thing. Kudos to them. They're going to make a ton of money off of it. But I think longer term, you know, you could also look at what happened with Research in motion and the BlackBerry, right? Like, the BlackBerry was arguably the market leader as kind of the first quote unquote smartphone. But what they did was they took a desktop computer and shoved it into a phone with this little tiny keyboard and whatnot. That doesn't come from a first principles perspective. So what happened? Apple took a first principles view of it and said, this is a flat piece of glass.
00:11:33.831 - 00:12:12.493, Speaker B: It's a fundamentally different experience. And I think that that analogy is somewhat relevant to the kind of Ethereum and Solana situation now is that it's not saying that Ethereum's bad or you shouldn't use it, it's just that there's this different approach that appears to be gaining traction. And so if you look at like the metrics beyond tvl, which I think is nonsense anyway, because markets should be capital efficient, they're basically flipping all of them. And I think that you're probably going to hear a lot this week in Singapore about how Solana is likely, if not imminently going to flip Ethereum in terms of all these metrics and what follows from that? It's probably, you know, a flipping of the market cap as well.
00:12:12.549 - 00:12:48.083, Speaker A: Yeah, it's, it's, it absolutely. One of the things I love about Solana when I started learning about it is really just as a, as a researcher is that it's just fundamentally designed differently. And if we look at like Bitcoin, Solana and Ethereum, they're all, they're all quite different from each other. You can't say the same about a bunch of other EVM L1s. Right? Or you know, even, even if you look at like Cosmos for example, which is one of the most fascinating and most important and oldest ecosystems, most of their, of the, of the sub chains, whatever they're called, I've now forgotten. Most of them are also evm. They use the EVM instead.
00:12:48.083 - 00:13:09.999, Speaker A: Right. But Solana has its own virtual machine. It's different programming language, different GAS mechanics and to me that's just fundamentally interesting. And I hear you when I Ethereum, some people have said like, you know, is Bitcoin the MySpace and we're like Bitcoin is more like the computer or like, I don't know, the keyboard. Like it's. When was the last time you saw an innovation in the keyboard?
00:13:10.047 - 00:13:10.775, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:13:10.815 - 00:13:24.779, Speaker A: Like it's going to work, it's going to be there. Ethereum is more like the computer where it's like, well, I mean now you're competing on technology and they even the switch to proof of stake, they like ripped the engine out of the plane while it's flying. Shocking that they were able to do that.
00:13:24.827 - 00:13:27.387, Speaker B: I mean it was amazing accomplishment for an open source project.
00:13:27.451 - 00:13:46.745, Speaker A: Really was. It really was. Especially with so much money at stake. This is what I was going to get to is, is that one of the primary defense mechanisms that it has, that there's all this capital behind Ethereum and on Ethereum, literally with the tokens and the OGs that have all this Ethereum wealth, like won't that alone, if almost nothing else, like keep it like in the game for forever?
00:13:47.725 - 00:14:56.785, Speaker B: I mean, look, it's a great question. My perspective is there's a lot of folks that got very wealthy off Ethereum and hats off to them, but how do we actually get a step function improvement in users of Web3 based technologies? And I've been of the opinion that if you're using Ethereum layer one, you have kind of non deterministic amount of time that a transaction is going to go through and then you also have a non deterministic amount of money that you're going to spend. And I don't believe that the masses are going to adopt that approach when they're using a Web3 based technology. In fact, my perspective is, is that for the masses to be adopting crypto or blockchain or web3 is that it's abstracted away that you don't even see it, right. Like the beauty of technology or the, you know, the magic of it is when it disappears. Right. And so I just struggle to see currently as we sit here today, like, you know, I've gone on record, we've owned 0 ether all year at the fund and it served us really well because fundamentally I don't see a reason to own the token.
00:14:56.785 - 00:15:02.325, Speaker B: It does not mean that there won't be a resurgence. It does not mean that there won't be some sort of innovative thing that happens.
00:15:02.365 - 00:15:02.861, Speaker A: Totally.
00:15:02.973 - 00:15:46.009, Speaker B: Right. It just means that as a trader on the hedge fund side, I'm looking at the relative value of Ether and going a lot of people have gotten wealthy off of it, a lot of people, you know, kind of own it today. But like, let's be clear, the year of the spot ETF, you've got ETH BTC trading at levels not seen since, you know, 2021. That's a fucking problem, right? Like, especially if you're long eth. And so as a trader I still don't see any, you know, kind of from a relative value standpoint, you know, is Ethereum now a value stock so to speak? Like probably not. But you know, will there be an opportunity for, for the price of it to improve and actually outperform? Yeah, of course, like that's what you do as a trader you'll want to always identify these opportunities. But the fundamentals for me are the challenge.
00:15:46.009 - 00:16:18.627, Speaker B: And the fundamentals right now are you have the layer one, which was initially a monolith, is now kind of outsourcing things like execution to L2s. Well, that's cool. And we have this modular narrative and it's adorable. But like modular is just a form of a service oriented architecture which has been around since the 1970s. This is not a new concept in computer science or software design. And there's trade offs. So for example, Uber has a microservices network, which is a service oriented architecture.
00:16:18.627 - 00:17:10.987, Speaker B: They have thousands of these little tiny services that they, that they use to kind of run their systems. And what's cool about that is like, you know, you can have teams work on individual services and then they all kind of connect to each other and you can test them individually. But then you're introducing entropy and complexity into the system because you have 5,000 microservices now. The key is Uber controls all of that. How are you going to get an entire, you know, kind of planet of developers working in a decentralized, permissionless context, agree on data availability, prop block production, execution, settlement, et cetera, when there's myriad of them being created as well? Like, I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just looking at it going probabilistically. This is a heavy lift. And by the way, in the meantime, there's this thing Solana that everybody seems to be using very, very easily and a lot of it's being abstracted away and the magic of the technology is actually happening on Solana.
00:17:11.091 - 00:17:41.833, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's really well articulated. You know, one way I think about Ethereum too is it's just kind of like a giant ball of wires. And they do keep incredibly maintaining and upgrading the system. But it's like there's only. I think the lead core maintainer for Geth once said that like he doesn't know that there's one person on earth that actually knows how the whole system works at this point. And yeah, it's just like, you know, that introduces a lot of complexity, it makes it slower again. I also agree.
00:17:41.833 - 00:17:56.801, Speaker A: I've been very vocally like an ETH BTC short. Although I'm not literally trading it myself. I don't think anyone really trades this ratio Eth Sol also down too. I mean, that's what's so interesting. Bitcoin and Sol both outperforming Ethereum a lot this year.
00:17:56.873 - 00:18:28.055, Speaker B: Well, and by the way, on that on that topic. Right. Like I've talked about this probably over the past couple of months now and various podcasts and interviews and whatnot. And my view is that, you know, Ethereum kind of has an identity crisis right now because, you know, at first it was kind of this world decentralized supercomputer. Now the next narrative was ultrasound money. And so Ethereum's kind of in the middle of that. Well, it turns out that the decentralized supercomputer is Solana because you can see the activity and everything that's possible there from deep into AI to like all this other stuff.
00:18:28.055 - 00:18:40.607, Speaker B: Right. And then the ultrasound money narrative, that's pretty much Bitcoin. And so Ethereum is kind of in this middle with this identity crisis, is getting like consumed by these other two things on both sides and it's reflected in relative value trade of BTC and solve.
00:18:40.631 - 00:19:08.017, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. It is. I think they, they wanted this disinflationary model created by EIP 1559 to be like this. It's what they call it the triple. The triple halving the amount that the inflation would reduce. But the reality is, I think smart people know that first of all, bitcoin has very low inflation at the moment it's like less than a percent. But also that sound money isn't just that it happens to usually be disinflationary.
00:19:08.081 - 00:19:08.417, Speaker B: Correct.
00:19:08.481 - 00:19:13.121, Speaker A: It's that it's predictable and unchanging and not being manipulated by 26 year old coders.
00:19:13.193 - 00:19:26.621, Speaker B: Right. Well, there's a requisite too for it to be inflationary. Right. And that's activity on the chain. And then all of a sudden you reduce the activity on the chain by putting execution out to L2s as well as. And there's the blob storage piece.
00:19:26.733 - 00:19:36.917, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah, 4844. There's even been some discussion among some developers, although I guess it's not very prominent yet. I follow Christine Kim's work at Galaxy.
00:19:36.941 - 00:19:38.405, Speaker B: Research, which is very good. Yeah.
00:19:38.445 - 00:20:04.175, Speaker A: And she's all over this stuff. But people are. It's almost turning into the opposite where people think stakers might need to be paid more, validators might need to be paid. So I totally agree. That was always silly to me. The main issue that I have, and this is where I want to start asking about stuff being built on Solana because you're deep in that ecosystem. But the sort of Web3 2021 narrative application layer narratives are all just really stagnant right now.
00:20:04.175 - 00:20:23.951, Speaker A: Right. Bitcoin in the ETFs and it's permeated and made all time highs this year. We asked one of our researchers to look and they said only 48 of the 14,000 coins on CoinGecko actually made all time highs. None of those are in the top 25. That's right. So it's basically. I mean, Sol did great, but actually that like 10 bagger was last fall into.
00:20:23.951 - 00:20:42.583, Speaker A: Into December. We were then fine. Yeah, exactly. So. But one of the really the two narratives, you know, if we leave like weird modularity and these, the restaking and all this stuff, which hasn't mostly even really launched anywhere yet. Not really. It's been like bitcoin and meme coins for a lot of this year.
00:20:42.583 - 00:20:45.191, Speaker A: And most of that trading activity was happening on Solana.
00:20:45.303 - 00:20:46.055, Speaker B: That's right.
00:20:46.215 - 00:20:57.911, Speaker A: Tell me about that. You were very vocal as a supporter of Bonk, which was the sort of the native OG dog coin on Solana. I don't know what. Maybe just start there. What was the story behind Bonk and your interest in it?
00:20:58.023 - 00:21:10.341, Speaker B: Yeah, look, so, you know, at Asymmetric, we kind of operate in the intersection of technology, capital and culture. And I think, I mean, look at me, they're like I covered in tattoos and you know, I've been in the music industry.
00:21:10.373 - 00:21:20.901, Speaker A: I didn't know you were. I guess I watched you on your. On chain pod bits and bips, I think. Really good pod with James Burt. Yeah. And Alex Kruger. Right.
00:21:20.901 - 00:21:24.829, Speaker A: And I didn't. And I didn't real. Somehow I didn't notice that you had these tattoos.
00:21:24.877 - 00:21:45.521, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, I don't look like your standard kind of hedge fund manager. Right. Like, and that's fine. Like, if you'd asked me 20 years ago that you'd be running a hedge fund, I'd be like, no fucking way. Right. But, you know, my interest, my brothers, we all grew up kind of tapped into the music, arts, fashion, culinary arts, like all of these different aspects of culture.
00:21:45.521 - 00:22:05.623, Speaker B: And it's permeated my entire life and into also my career. You know, I used to be a dj. I had record labels, fashion line with my brother. I was in like Harvey Nichols and Bergdorf Goodman. Like we've, we've touched aspects of culture. When I worked at mother, which is one of the top ad agencies in the world, like, that's a creative communications agency. You learn a lot about culture through that type of, you know, that type of an environment.
00:22:05.623 - 00:22:51.293, Speaker B: And when I started Asymmetric, you know. Yes, we're hardcore macro. We do lots of trades, we trade tons With Galaxy, as you guys know, like, we are hardcore traders, we're focused on generated return, trial piece. But crypto blockchain web 3 is the financial kind of instrument available to Internet culture. And my hypothesis last year was in some capacity, pop culture, Internet culture is going to collide in a tokenized fashion in some way, shape or form. I don't know what it looks like, but my hypothesis is, you know, there's going to be a thing that happens. And so part of the reason I was so early to Bonk was a lot of it was more of like our proprietary indicators we have in house, like some wallet forensics and stablecoin flows.
00:22:51.293 - 00:23:24.301, Speaker B: And like I built a piece of software that, you know, identify as order flows and unlike centralized exchanges, whatnot. So we were looking at like the data, but then I was also like, okay, wait a second. So Solana breakpoints about a year ago, Salon break points happening. We're about to potentially break through the Solana break point, like high when the FTX collapse happened. If those flows start to come in, then people are going to be wealthier on Solana because they're holding Sol and then they're going to want to trade beta to that. Well, what are they going to end up buying? They're going to buy a fucking Meme coin. Well, what's the meme coin available? Bonk.
00:23:24.301 - 00:23:59.361, Speaker B: Bonk also has a phenomenal story behind it that is like Netflix quality. And the early contributors, the team basically behind Bonk are lights out. Like these guys have done amazing work because they're big salana community, you know, advocates. And I just looked at it and said, all right, let's see. It's $28 million market cap. If Solana goes from, you know, 28 bucks to back to a hundred, Bonk has to go 10x, you know, if not significantly higher. And at asymmetric, we have a concentration risk policy, which means we never take a position that's not in a token, that's not in the top 20 by market cap, no more than 2% of our funds.
00:23:59.361 - 00:24:05.089, Speaker B: AUM. So it wasn't a huge piece of the portfolio because it was 2%.
00:24:05.177 - 00:24:05.617, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:05.721 - 00:24:40.335, Speaker B: But the return was enormous. And so the hypothesis was like, you know, there's some data here. Culture is going to start adopting this thing. And then what came from that? I did not expect what I, what I saw happen with like dog with hat and then Q1 of this year. This absolute explosion of meme coin activity to me validated my assumption that Solana has product market fit for retail Salon has product market fit for, you know, pop culture. And people can like opine or, or bitch and moan about whether meme coins are good or bad. I'm like, I don't care.
00:24:40.335 - 00:25:02.847, Speaker B: It's a permissionless network and it's happening. Right? So this is not going to stop. Right? So I work with Iggy Azalea on a bunch of stuff. She's very committed to what she's doing with her mother community. She's building a brand around mother. It's not just the token. And I think like, did anybody see that coming? No, because you look at the celebrities that have entered the space and before and most of them are grifters or scams or their accounts get hacked.
00:25:02.847 - 00:25:37.601, Speaker B: It's a complete nightmare. She's doing something very different because she understands virality, she understands culture, she understands communication and she understands brand building. And so I think like the arc of meme coins, culture coins, whatever you want to call it, is nowhere near done because there's so much more that we can do. And so with Solana specifically, like, you know, no disrespect, you literally can't do this on an Ethel one. You can do it on base, you can do it on Arbitrum, like, but that in and of itself introduces friction to the end user. Whereas like on Solana it's like phantom wallet, pump fun done. Right.
00:25:37.601 - 00:25:42.657, Speaker B: And Pump fun was the fastest protocol ever or I guess project ever to $100 million. Right.
00:25:42.721 - 00:25:56.659, Speaker A: They were printing like, I forget some stat. It was something like 5,000 meme coins an hour at one point were being created. And again, not that we know most of those, the vast majority are worthless. But it's. But the infrastructure to actually work for that to work.
00:25:56.707 - 00:26:16.413, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. I mean that is a test. That's like the test of like the product market fit, if you will, of the underlying cortex right now the thing about like a pump fund, I'm not an investor any of that kind of stuff. Like yeah, 99.9% of all of the tokens on there are people have lost money on. But you know what? Guess what else people lose money on? Fucking scratch off tickets, lottery tickets, slot machines, you name it.
00:26:16.413 - 00:26:32.765, Speaker B: People are speculating. And speculating is a very fantastic use case to prove out product market fit. It turns out that in Las Vegas last year on the Las Vegas Strip, 75% of all the revenue came from non gambling activity. So what was a, what is a casinos raison debt?
00:26:32.845 - 00:26:33.269, Speaker A: Wow.
00:26:33.357 - 00:26:53.257, Speaker B: To get people to gamble, you know, where they're making their money. Not gambling like restaurants and restaurants, clubs, shopping, like the, you know, the spas, et cetera, et cetera. 75%. The point that I'm getting to is that speculation is a necessary and sufficient condition for any market to exist. Period. End of story. You can all the way go back to like the railroad days in the United States in the late 1800s.
00:26:53.257 - 00:26:58.273, Speaker B: It's the same thing. People were speculating on this new concept of like rails, railroads.
00:26:58.329 - 00:27:01.017, Speaker A: They also had to build them to get to the gold and like all these different.
00:27:01.041 - 00:27:21.207, Speaker B: And it was like, I'm just going to speculate in it and see what happens. And then what was the use case? Oh, literally like transporting goods. Right. The same sort of thing happened in Las Vegas with the gambling revenue is that the initial use case was speculation, AKA gambling. And now it turns into something else. I think you're going to see more of that in Web3 and Solana is clearly a chain that's enabling that to happen. You can speculate on a meme coin.
00:27:21.207 - 00:27:36.191, Speaker B: You can be a part of a funny meme, part of a community. You probably know you're not going to make a ton of money on it, but hey, maybe. And it's the same concept when people go to a grocery store, you know, a bodega and buy a lottery tickets. The same idea. And this is never going away.
00:27:36.263 - 00:27:38.967, Speaker A: And in the meantime it battle tests this giant system.
00:27:39.031 - 00:27:39.391, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:27:39.423 - 00:27:42.193, Speaker A: It leads to the infrastructure and the tooling and whatever. Whatever else.
00:27:42.249 - 00:27:42.705, Speaker B: That's right.
00:27:42.785 - 00:27:50.965, Speaker A: What else on Solana? Application layer stuff. I mean Deepin, you had mentioned before what gets you hyped as you look, you know, across the next couple years of innovation.
00:27:51.785 - 00:28:14.661, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that, you know, my friends at Multicoin do, I think excellent work on a lot of the Deepin related stuff. So I got to give a shout out to them. We don't have nearly the capital they do to invest in it. So I'm glad they are doing that. I think that there, I think one thing that folks should probably consider. I've been thinking about it a while and I don't know the best way of articulating the investment thesis.
00:28:14.661 - 00:28:40.593, Speaker B: But the Internet right now is centralized, period. Right. The cables that are laid like the way domain names are resolved. It's still very censorship bubble. It's not permissionless, it's not decentralized, it's very centralized. And so I do think that there's, I don't know what you want to call it, like Internet infrastructure or something. It's deep pin like a little different.
00:28:40.609 - 00:28:42.065, Speaker A: Than what People talk about with Deepin.
00:28:42.105 - 00:28:43.553, Speaker B: Yeah, because Deepin, they're really Talking about.
00:28:43.569 - 00:28:45.033, Speaker A: Like IoT and stuff like that.
00:28:45.049 - 00:28:45.513, Speaker B: Exactly right.
00:28:45.569 - 00:28:47.441, Speaker A: But yeah, I like where you're headed with this.
00:28:47.473 - 00:29:11.375, Speaker B: Helium is obviously very cool. Hivemapper is obviously very cool. Like there's render's very cool. There's a lot of like cool, I guess more renders, more like GPU AI stuff. But the DPIN stuff is very, very interesting. But it's still relatively vertically specific. And so if we zoom out and look at the actual infrastructure of the Internet, first of all, it's a fucking miracle that the Internet works, period.
00:29:11.375 - 00:29:16.907, Speaker B: If you talk to technologists, they're like, yeah, I don't know, it's like the guys with the Ethereum, I don't know how it works.
00:29:16.931 - 00:29:17.779, Speaker A: I'm not sure how it works.
00:29:17.827 - 00:29:26.715, Speaker B: Yes. But I do think there's something to be said about. There's a recent company, I forget their name. I think Multicoin was in them. That's a decentralized cdn, a content delivery network.
00:29:26.755 - 00:29:27.075, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:27.155 - 00:29:28.779, Speaker B: Like, so now think about like what.
00:29:28.787 - 00:29:32.755, Speaker A: Was the one that was. There was live peer was one from back in the day. They're still around.
00:29:32.795 - 00:29:33.707, Speaker B: I just mean it may not be.
00:29:33.731 - 00:29:35.531, Speaker A: That one, but yeah, similar idea.
00:29:35.603 - 00:30:11.523, Speaker B: Yeah. And so like whether it's content delivery network, it's DNS, DNS, it's, it's Internet service providers, it's cable, it's like, you know, the way that packets travel across the Internet right now is incredibly inefficient. And I think that there would be a better use case for like say a marketplace for, you know, Internet access and like, you know, basically like reducing the amount of friction that a packet has to travel around the world. Because what happens is you send something, that packet turns into electricity, goes to a router, gets turned back into a packet, and if it's not the end state, it turns back into electricity. And it keeps doing that until it reaches its destination.
00:30:11.619 - 00:30:11.827, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:11.851 - 00:30:37.269, Speaker B: That's a lot of frac, a lot of friction in the process. Like how do we actually eliminate that? And is there a way to create maybe like a decentralized marketplace for that type of opportunity? I don't know. Again, I haven't really fully like articulated the investment thesis, but I do think that probably if there is a chain that's going to enable this type of stuff to exist, a truly decentralized Internet infrastructure, set of layers, it's probably Solana because you've already have the pressure test with things like helium and these other deep end projects.
00:30:37.357 - 00:30:53.545, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, before we wrap, I want to ask you about macro. You've. You were calling for a bigger hike than and we're not surprised when you were right. Jay Powell announced a 50 bips. I guess the start of a cutting site. Sorry, not like cut a start of a cutting cycle.
00:30:53.625 - 00:30:54.325, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:54.625 - 00:31:07.217, Speaker A: Does this help risk assets? Does this help crypto in the near term, in the long term? I mean forget we don't have to dunk on the Fed for their unless you want to. But I mean I'm more interested about where you see us going from here and what the impact would be on markets.
00:31:07.361 - 00:31:29.241, Speaker B: Yeah, don't let the tattoos fool you. We are, we are a macro shop. Like we are heavy macro. And myself and my head of trading have like 50 years combined trading experience. Global macro, cross asset, cross geo. I think we have a pretty good grip on this thing. Yes, we are a crypto fund but like we're a macro shop that expresses macro through crypto.
00:31:29.241 - 00:32:02.865, Speaker B: And there may be a moment where we express macro through macro products. But ultimately our strategy doesn't change. We, we use macro as a kind of guiding principle for how we want to express our investment views. 2022, we were super dark and bearish and we were short like through put spreads on Bitcoin because it's a tightening cycle. Like it's not that hard to figure out what's going to happen to risk assets. We believed back in early July and we wrote about this, you guys can check the receipts that if the Fed doesn't cut at the July meeting 25bps, they have to do 50 in September. And people thought I was crazy.
00:32:02.865 - 00:32:17.841, Speaker B: Turns out they did 50 today. Right. Like as at the, you know, 2:30am here in Singapore, I was, trust me, I was up trading. And people now kind of of course like look at it and go back and say, oh well, yeah, it was so obvious. Like they have. No, it wasn't. Like it was absolutely not obvious.
00:32:17.841 - 00:32:21.721, Speaker B: And in fact a week ago the Fed fund futures percentage for was like 8%.
00:32:21.793 - 00:32:25.233, Speaker A: We can go back on the Bloomberg terminal and exactly how not obvious it was.
00:32:25.289 - 00:32:51.719, Speaker B: And so you know, am I taking a cringe victory lap? Of course. Right. Like it. But we're doing this in a, in a manner that is consistent with our strategy at asymmetric. Like when the real rates are well above the historical average of 1%. They've been trading 3 over 3% for months now. People look at that and go why would the Fed cut 50 bips? The economy is doing really well.
00:32:51.719 - 00:33:19.691, Speaker B: Like employment is Softening a little bit, but it's not crazy. Inflation is clearly tamed. You've got annualized, you know, PCE at like 15 right now, or excuse me, three month annualized at 1.5. You've got one, two and even five year inflation forwards below 2% which is the Fed's target. Like there's no inflation, right. But then you look at it and go, well why would they cut though? And it's like, well think about it this way. When you have a 3 plus percent real rate, you end up having by definition a restrictive environment.
00:33:19.691 - 00:33:38.195, Speaker B: It doesn't mean the economy is doing bad, but the economy is not the average. The Fed likes to use the average. In fact most people like to use the average. We don't view it that way. We view the economy through what's called a bimodal distribution, not a normal distribution. Bimodal means there's two humps. The hump on the right, that's rich people, they love high rates.
00:33:38.195 - 00:33:44.403, Speaker B: They put their cash in a T bill and make tons of money. And if they're getting a 3% real return risk free all day long, yeah.
00:33:44.419 - 00:33:46.075, Speaker A: They'Re the ones doing the lending basically.
00:33:46.155 - 00:34:13.685, Speaker B: Exactly. That's all to Janet Yellen. Right, like so that's also the huge corporates, Apple, Meta, etc. These guys with massive balance sheets, they love high rates. Now let's go to the other side of the distribution. Those are people that are living check to check that don't own assets that are struggling as well as say small businesses that rely on financing to run their businesses like the Russell 2000. So if you look at like the Russell 2000, they've been absolutely smoked through this high interest rate environment.
00:34:13.685 - 00:34:55.037, Speaker B: So why did we believe that they were going to have to cut 51? You cannot have a restrictive policy in place that long without actually breaking something. I think Jerome Powell has done a reasonably bigger job of threading the needle and not kind of taming inflation post Covid, but also not destroying the economy. And two, if they didn't cut 50 today in September, you have six weeks till the next meeting. And do you know when that next meeting is? Right around the election. Now we can talk all day to our blue in the face about whether or not this should be a political thing or not. It doesn't matter if you have one bad data point between September and November and you have to do an emergency cut that will get politicized dramatically. Right.
00:34:55.037 - 00:35:22.321, Speaker B: And so I think the Fed was looking it from a forward looking perspective of saying like We've got the data to support it. Like, we probably should have cut 25 in July. But like the data came out the day of the meeting. They're looking at 50, saying we can do 50 now. We're still like 200 basis points above the historical neutral rate of 1% on a real yield basis. Let's do 50 now. And that way we've kind of ensured that in the case that there is this kind of bad data print, we've already cut 50.
00:35:22.321 - 00:35:34.575, Speaker B: And the other thing is, if they cut 50 now, they can also do 25 going forward. When they started their tightening cycle, they shocked the market with 75. 75. Right. People thought, they're not going to 75, they're not going to do it again. Yeah, they did. Right.
00:35:34.575 - 00:35:53.143, Speaker B: And so to me it wasn't, it didn't seem that far fetched that you have a Fed, cut 50 in September, give themselves some breathing room through the election, get to the election point. And if they need to do another 50 or they start doing 25, fine. If you do 25, I think equities would have absolutely gotten smoked. And you didn't see that today when they actually cut for 50.
00:35:53.199 - 00:36:03.039, Speaker A: Right, right. It's really a tricky problem. I agree. Jay Powell, I think, has done a, quite, quite a good job with, I mean, maybe the worst job in the world or the hardest job in the world.
00:36:03.087 - 00:36:06.595, Speaker B: I mean, no one is happy with you in your job ever.
