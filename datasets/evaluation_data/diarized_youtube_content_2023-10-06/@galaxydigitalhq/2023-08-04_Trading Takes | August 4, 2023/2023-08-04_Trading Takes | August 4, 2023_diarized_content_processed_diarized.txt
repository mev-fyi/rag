00:00:07.600 - 00:00:12.246, Speaker A: Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. As always, my friend Bimnet, welcome to the show.
00:00:12.390 - 00:00:13.414, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:13.494 - 00:00:14.834, Speaker A: What's going on this week?
00:00:15.814 - 00:00:38.366, Speaker B: Well, I think the most important thing to happen this week is the breakdown that you've had in long end us fixed income that's been driven by a combination of really robust data out of the US, in addition to additional supply above and beyond what the market had expected being announced by the treasury.
00:00:38.430 - 00:00:46.594, Speaker A: So this is them selling new issuance of bonds to refill their coffers after the debt ceiling stuff.
00:00:47.734 - 00:01:34.814, Speaker B: This is regular course of business. The debt ceiling is a weird thing, but every quarter of the treasury tells you how much of each particular issue they're going to issue. So they'll be like, oh, this month we're going to sell $40 billion of tens. Next month we'll sell 45. And so the treasury produced those figures today, and they were a little bit higher than expected in the US, particularly for the longer duration profile securities. And we were coming off of really strong data like ADP today printed like around 340,000 jobs gained month on month versus expectations of like 192. You had PCE data come out late last week that was showed that we're still in inflation.
00:01:34.814 - 00:02:25.934, Speaker B: There wasn't anything that tells you that, oh, we can cool down and durable good orders were really strong. And then you've got the employment data that's coming out that this Friday. And you also, there was one bit of data that was a little contrary to this price action. It's known as the senior loan officer survey slews. It's basically a survey that's used to gauge credit conditions. So it asks a bunch of bank lending managers and folks that are in charge of that process, what's going on with credit? Basically, they're like credit's contracting. And that was one of the things that Powell highlighted in his speech is that, you know, we are seeing a pass through of high interest rates into credit market, which they want.
00:02:25.974 - 00:02:28.014, Speaker A: Right. That thing, that's monetary tightness.
00:02:28.054 - 00:02:52.764, Speaker B: That's how you transmit monetary policy into the real economy. Right. And so you are seeing that tightening now, like with stocks still close to the dead highs and historically tight labor market, though, like, just because you are seeing credit contraction, the question is, will that translate into a decline in core inflation? And right now it's. Yet it's still tough to say.
00:02:52.804 - 00:02:56.052, Speaker A: Just saw a headline that was like, Americans are just still happily spending a.
00:02:56.068 - 00:03:18.996, Speaker B: Lot of money, tons of money. Absolutely. And it's like one the social transfers that happened during COVID They're still expansive. But the big part is, and it's a new point that I just came across from a hedge fund newsletter, but it's really hard for companies to fire people when their stock is at all time highs or close to it.
00:03:19.020 - 00:03:19.716, Speaker A: It's hard to say.
00:03:19.740 - 00:03:40.392, Speaker B: We have to tighten the belt. Yeah, we have to tighten the belt. Wait, you're tightening the belt? And stocks up 40% on the year. How does that translate? I really think the crux of the inflation issue comes down to the tightness in the US labor market. And that tightness isn't. I don't know how that's gonna change. We're getting tighter and tighter.
00:03:40.448 - 00:03:41.084, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:41.504 - 00:03:48.216, Speaker B: And job, we had job opening data this week. We still have 9.6 million job openings in the US.
00:03:48.280 - 00:03:48.952, Speaker A: And how many people?
00:03:49.008 - 00:03:57.784, Speaker B: That is roughly. There are 1.7 jobs per person looking. Wow. Wow. Right.
00:03:57.824 - 00:04:00.296, Speaker A: So the pricing power is still in the hands of the employees at this point.
00:04:00.400 - 00:04:20.636, Speaker B: And so that's why you have to pay real close attention to average hourly earnings. Right. And then unit labor costs. And last week we had the employment cost index that I believe was in line around 4%. But wages are keeping up is the point. And then the other part is just home. Home prices are fine.
00:04:20.636 - 00:04:25.244, Speaker B: Cause there's no supply of housing otherwise. There's no supply of houses. Everybody has less than 3% mortgage.
00:04:25.284 - 00:04:25.916, Speaker A: They're locked in.
00:04:25.980 - 00:04:32.052, Speaker B: So like, it's just becoming like so tough to break that. Exactly.
00:04:32.108 - 00:04:36.570, Speaker A: And so at least it's not too bad. What it's cementing at right now. It's not where they want it.
00:04:36.722 - 00:04:37.698, Speaker B: It's getting better.
00:04:37.746 - 00:04:40.474, Speaker A: But what do we have year over year? CPI in June was three.
00:04:40.554 - 00:04:44.202, Speaker B: Right, but that's a headline. Right. The core, what was that?
00:04:44.218 - 00:04:44.650, Speaker A: Is higher.
00:04:44.722 - 00:04:50.890, Speaker B: I think the core is correct. If I'm wrong, like around four, like low fours.
00:04:50.922 - 00:04:51.634, Speaker A: That's not great.
00:04:51.714 - 00:04:54.794, Speaker B: That's 2% target. You're 200 basis points away.
00:04:54.954 - 00:04:57.026, Speaker A: And when are the student loan forgiveness?
00:04:57.090 - 00:05:00.094, Speaker B: October. October, yeah.
00:05:01.064 - 00:05:03.324, Speaker A: Should that have a positive impact on.
00:05:03.744 - 00:05:09.968, Speaker B: The average student loan payment in the US is around $550 a month. A month?
00:05:10.016 - 00:05:10.456, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:10.560 - 00:05:23.224, Speaker B: And so I don't know what portion of that is like federal versus private, but there's a lot of money that needs to get paid as a function of these student loans. And that starts in October. So that should be a drag.
00:05:23.264 - 00:05:24.176, Speaker A: I take some out of it, but.
00:05:24.200 - 00:05:31.230, Speaker B: At the end of the day, it's like if people have jobs and they have credit cards and they can't buy homes anymore.
00:05:31.302 - 00:05:32.110, Speaker A: What else are they gonna buy?
00:05:32.142 - 00:05:34.974, Speaker B: Yeah, what else are they gonna buy? Stocks. Stocks.
00:05:35.014 - 00:05:35.718, Speaker A: Consumer goods.
00:05:35.766 - 00:05:36.390, Speaker B: Consumer goods.
00:05:36.422 - 00:05:36.926, Speaker A: Stocks.
00:05:37.030 - 00:05:38.262, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
00:05:38.278 - 00:05:38.502, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:38.558 - 00:05:46.438, Speaker B: And so, you know, I mean, durable goods has shown, like, remarkable strength. Like, it's like, I can't buy a home. Like a box stuff.
00:05:46.446 - 00:05:52.696, Speaker A: What am I gonna buy? Furniture. Literally buy a new couch. I just bought a new couch. It's great, by the way.
00:05:52.870 - 00:05:53.756, Speaker B: Amazing. Let's.
00:05:53.780 - 00:05:55.884, Speaker A: Let's talk about the crypto markets a little bit.
00:05:55.964 - 00:05:56.628, Speaker B: Let's get going.
00:05:56.676 - 00:06:04.148, Speaker A: So there's been, here's one thing that happened earlier this week. Right. There was this, this motion to dismiss ruling in the terraform labs.
00:06:04.236 - 00:06:04.796, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:04.860 - 00:06:28.106, Speaker A: Yep. SEC litigation. And the market was interested in this because in, in the motion to dismiss, again, just another of the SEC cases, the judge specifically made a point to specifically reject the analysis put forth by the other judge in the ripple ruling two or three weeks ago. And so what was the reaction in markets generally to this?
00:06:28.290 - 00:06:33.374, Speaker B: You know, I would say that it was fairly muted. That's what I thought, too.
00:06:34.034 - 00:06:35.538, Speaker A: Seemed like a relatively big story.
00:06:35.626 - 00:06:50.852, Speaker B: A relatively big story. Ultimately, where I thought, you know, you'd see the greatest impact was on ripple, because in the original ruling, it moved a lot. Right. But you really haven't seen follow through on the ripple side. Technically, they still did win their case.
00:06:50.948 - 00:06:51.260, Speaker A: Well, yeah.
00:06:51.292 - 00:06:53.356, Speaker B: It's just the precedent around the security stuff.
00:06:53.380 - 00:06:56.524, Speaker A: That's right. These two cases, like, don't affect each other directly.
00:06:56.604 - 00:06:56.868, Speaker B: Correct.
00:06:56.916 - 00:07:13.108, Speaker A: But it's more just like, well, we thought we had a positive ruling and question on how we test stuff, and now we literally have the exact same federal district court, the southern District of New York, just with a different ruling. That's the opposite of it. So now we're just back to, like, square one of, like, no clarity.
00:07:13.236 - 00:07:19.644, Speaker B: No clarity. And fundamentally, that should be bad for alts. Right. But you already had the moves.
00:07:19.984 - 00:07:24.768, Speaker A: We're already down from over 30k. We're already down from 1900 ETH. Yeah.
00:07:24.856 - 00:07:52.210, Speaker B: Yeah. And so that wasn't constructive. And I think your point about judicial precedent and the lack of precedent that that ripple ruling now has is very meaningful. But I'd say the biggest piece of crypto news out there came from Michael Saylor, who recently announced by his company that he's going to be purchasing another $750 million of bitcoin, potentially. And so this guy is going to.
00:07:52.242 - 00:07:55.890, Speaker A: Own all the bitcoin. What does he have, 150,000 bitcoin or something?
00:07:56.082 - 00:07:57.054, Speaker B: Got a lot.
00:07:57.354 - 00:07:58.418, Speaker A: He's one of the biggest.
00:07:58.506 - 00:07:59.774, Speaker B: 200 now.
00:08:00.514 - 00:08:01.370, Speaker A: Definitely one of the biggest.
00:08:01.402 - 00:08:07.850, Speaker B: Stacks of coin. He's buying a lot, but that was.
00:08:08.042 - 00:08:11.138, Speaker A: Kind of back to break even or whatever his cost basis.
00:08:11.186 - 00:08:14.974, Speaker B: He, he's right around there. Yeah. It's like around 29,500.
00:08:15.594 - 00:08:16.874, Speaker A: Wild strategy.
00:08:17.034 - 00:08:22.818, Speaker B: It is, and I respect it, and I wish I had courage, maybe a.
00:08:22.826 - 00:08:24.174, Speaker A: Fraction of that courage.
00:08:24.874 - 00:08:28.762, Speaker B: It takes a lot of courage to do what he's doing.
00:08:28.938 - 00:08:32.534, Speaker A: You don't think markets are reacting on the litecoin having.
00:08:33.474 - 00:08:55.850, Speaker B: Sorry. No, no. I think it's relevant, but just in the big picture. Right. We just had an exploit of curve. Right? Yeah. And the spillover has yet to be fully finalized, but I think the fact that you've seen huge reductions in some.
00:08:55.882 - 00:08:57.722, Speaker A: Coin prices, defi prices.
00:08:57.778 - 00:09:26.350, Speaker B: Defi prices collapsing. I mean, I think that's notable. That is notable. And I think it's notable in the sense of market confidence in Defi and some of these defi tokens. And so I'm still waiting on kind of seeing the follow through from that. I would think that part of the value of ETH, or the value proposition of ETH is a very robust and secure defi system. And that argument definitely took a little bit of a hit this week.
00:09:26.350 - 00:09:33.422, Speaker B: And so I'm not as constructive on the ETH defi complex as I was.
00:09:33.478 - 00:09:36.874, Speaker A: A week ago at the moment. Yeah, yeah, that was a big, that was a big deal.
00:09:37.294 - 00:09:47.766, Speaker B: That's a big deal. And fundamentally, like, like, the idea of security and stableness, like, is crucial to products.
00:09:47.830 - 00:10:00.542, Speaker A: That can't be the reason why this stuff isn't working. It should. Like, that's very, that puts a real dent in the, in the armor. Right. And, like, really hurts confidence when these types of exploits happen. That's curve two. Right.
00:10:00.542 - 00:10:03.434, Speaker A: Is the most important stable coin money market, basically.
00:10:04.494 - 00:10:10.614, Speaker B: And I think that money market model is one that we should have dropped in, you know, traditional money markets.
00:10:10.694 - 00:10:11.814, Speaker A: If it doesn't get hacked.
00:10:11.894 - 00:10:21.958, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, like, why couldn't we have a euro yen, like, you know, stable coin pool on there, everybody trading 24/7 day? Like, I would love to.
00:10:22.006 - 00:10:23.214, Speaker A: There's genuine innovation there.
00:10:23.254 - 00:10:28.030, Speaker B: No, there's genuine. Seriously. And, like, yield bearing stables, if that ever came about.
00:10:28.102 - 00:10:28.470, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:28.542 - 00:11:00.014, Speaker B: Like, and you'd put them, like, on chain and trade. There's so much potential there. And so that's why it's a little deflating, to be honest with you. And so I think the trades are pretty easy. I mean, you have a guy that's about to buy $750 million at bitcoin, and you have defi moving around here, moving around here, and it's not looking great. So, personally, I like bitcoin higher ETH, not to go higher.
00:11:00.874 - 00:11:05.354, Speaker A: All right, you heard it here. Bimnet aveebi from galaxy trading. As always, my friend. Greg Levy.
00:11:05.474 - 00:11:05.834, Speaker B: Thank you.
