00:00:00.640 - 00:00:17.606, Speaker A: Welcome to Galaxy Brains, an infinite amount of cash. Cash. I'm your host, Alex Thorne. The US banking system is sound and resilient. Bitcoin made a new all time high. If you're not long, if you're not long, you're short. Satoshi's gonna come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet.
00:00:17.606 - 00:00:22.114, Speaker A: All. Bitcoin's gonna be erased. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's the best crypto else.
00:00:22.774 - 00:00:24.794, Speaker B: Bitcoin is going to zero.
00:00:25.514 - 00:00:42.266, Speaker A: Welcome back, bitcoin. Not zero. Down a little bit since last week, but definitely not zero. Hey, thanks for listening to galaxy brains. You probably heard our new intro. Shout out to Phineas, my homie and his awesome team for making that. We're going to transition to a little bit of a new format.
00:00:42.266 - 00:01:06.394, Speaker A: I know no rap intro going forward, but that doesn't mean that I won't rap sometimes. I told Phineas when we first met, you put me in front of a mic long enough, he's gonna rap. So, you know, maybe in the middle or at the end of an episode, if warranted. But going forward, I think this is gonna be our new intro, and I really like it. What do you think, Finn? Is it time? I mean, we did like 60 plus raps, intro raps or something.
00:01:06.514 - 00:01:23.554, Speaker C: It's the evolution of the show. It's the next phase. I think what's cool about it is music will always be baked into the identity of galaxy brains, and that's part of it. So there's gonna be music within it. We're gonna still rap. There's gonna be. We'll do bigger projects and we'll make it interesting.
00:01:23.554 - 00:01:34.442, Speaker C: But, yeah, I mean, I think it's just the new chapter. We're trying something different. And this intro, I think, is representative of the show in many ways and of the personality of the show. And I'm excited.
00:01:34.538 - 00:02:05.298, Speaker A: Yeah, I am, too. I love this intro, too. Just if you're keeping score at home, I think in order, if I remember them all, it opens with neel Kashkari, a Fed governor, saying the Fed has infinite cash. Then Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, saying the US banking system is sound and resilient. Some clips from me introducing myself in there. Mike Novogratz saying, if you're not long, you're short. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of the world's largest bank, JP Morgan, saying that Satoshi is going to come back and laugh hysterically and then erase all the bitcoin.
00:02:05.298 - 00:02:25.464, Speaker A: That was in response to Joe Kiernan once on squawk, saying, no, we do know that there will only ever be 21 million. I don't know. Jamie thinks there's an Easter egg somewhere in there that will undo that at the end. Great quote. Satoshi. And then we got Michael Saylor, of course, and I don't know, the other last guy's name says bitcoin's going to zero. But it's just a funny clip.
00:02:26.444 - 00:02:37.904, Speaker C: It's a really. I mean, I think many of our listeners will know all of the references within the intro. We were talking about this, but I think a lot of our new listeners may not.
00:02:38.244 - 00:02:42.572, Speaker A: And, you know, you put on some cool turntablism over one of my beats. I always like the sound of that.
00:02:42.628 - 00:02:43.268, Speaker C: It's your beat.
00:02:43.316 - 00:03:10.124, Speaker A: Yeah, that's your beat.

Let's go now to our friend Bimnet Abibi from Galaxy trading. Bimnet, welcome as always to Galaxy Brains.
00:03:10.204 - 00:03:12.276, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, and welcome back from London.
00:03:12.340 - 00:03:21.316, Speaker A: Thank you. Yes, I was traveling. I went to cheat code in London, Peter McCormack, because we got the real Bedford FC banner over here. Very fun conference shout out to.
00:03:21.340 - 00:03:22.716, Speaker B: And now you're a real football fan.
00:03:22.780 - 00:03:44.938, Speaker A: I am. I've seen actual football be played. It was great. I am back, though, and while I was in London, however, there was a geopolitical event that's weighed on markets. If you look over my shoulder, you see the block clock again. It's funny to be saying this at 61k, but I look at it, I see the number, I say to myself, bad number. It should be higher number.
00:03:44.938 - 00:03:58.834, Speaker A: Anyway, we'll debate about why, what the causes were of that, but first, I know there's been a lot of. So there's been macro news and broader markets have been sliding as well now for several weeks, I think. Right, what's going on?
00:03:59.614 - 00:05:07.934, Speaker B: So, one, in terms of sort of us monetary policy, you've had a series of strong data prints with CPI, PPI, and those strong data prints have caused the Fed to kind of react. And more specifically, the commentary from Fed officials has moved from three cuts is appropriate this year, and that was what was in the dot plot to two to one. And now you're kind of pricing in like one and a half cuts this year all in. And we started the year at seven. So the combination of this hawkish Fed speak and hot data has led to a major repricing in the US interest rate curve. And yields across the entirety of the US yield curve have all moved higher and as a consequence, the dollar has gained a lot of value, particularly against EM. Countries like dollar, China dollar, Korea dollar Max G ten currency pairs are also moving lower.
00:05:07.934 - 00:06:07.294, Speaker B: Euro broke through 107, almost got through 106. On top of that, what you're seeing in us equity markets is also fairly notable. We've had breaks of the 50 day moving averages, basically three weeks of other of moving sideways and then down. And some of that weakness in equities is attributable to the bond price action. But there's another component to it which I think is also very relevant, which is kind of the deterioration of the US consumer in a way, and the subsequent and likely deterioration of earnings. There was a company today, a freight company, and they basically were like this quarter, our loads are down and their expenses are also high because of things like car insurance, commodities, energy prices. And so their margins are getting squeezed because people want less stuff.
00:06:07.294 - 00:06:28.728, Speaker B: And in order to do the exact same activity, the cost of that has gone up. And there are also a couple of consumer discretionary companies, retailers that have given guidance recently and that guidance has been not so great. And so there's actually genuine concern about the US consumer.
00:06:28.816 - 00:06:32.008, Speaker A: Wow. But hadn't the consumer been remarkably strong for.
00:06:32.056 - 00:06:46.120, Speaker B: They had been remarkably strong. However, what's happening is inflation's actually starting to take a bite from their ability to consume. And what that's related to is basically what I like to think of necessity, inflation.
00:06:46.272 - 00:06:46.656, Speaker D: Right.
00:06:46.720 - 00:06:53.088, Speaker B: What are some of the components that are rising the hottest right now? Home insurance, car insurance, medical costs.
00:06:53.136 - 00:06:58.800, Speaker A: Things are like in many cases mandated by law to buy correct gas prices.
00:06:58.872 - 00:06:59.080, Speaker D: Right.
00:06:59.112 - 00:07:05.528, Speaker B: We're all, yeah, you're feeling it. Look, you look at like the Big Mac index, that's up a lot more than headline CPI and I don't want.
00:07:05.536 - 00:07:18.656, Speaker A: To pick on them in specific. Remember there was the $5 foot long and now there's the six dollar six inch. That's inflation, that's more expensive and it's half. No, it really is true, though. That's literally the sandwich that like.
00:07:18.800 - 00:07:21.152, Speaker B: To be clear, that's how I measure my inflation.
00:07:21.328 - 00:07:31.264, Speaker A: I'm just saying like, it used to be a dollar five for twelve for a giant one, and now it's more expensive for half as much. Yes, but yes. So people are filling it in food too. Yeah.
00:07:31.304 - 00:07:48.824, Speaker B: And so what's happening is that, you know, discretionary spending that's taking a hit. And people are already at sort of like lower savings rate and lower saving base in the US. Cause people have just been consuming so much and so much and wages aren't keeping up with inflation anymore.
00:07:48.904 - 00:07:56.936, Speaker A: So they're running out of money. They're not buying as much. So the earnings can be bad. But at the same time, inflation is still actually now rising again.
00:07:57.040 - 00:07:57.512, Speaker B: Correct.
00:07:57.608 - 00:08:04.928, Speaker A: So they can't cut as much, which means risk has been going down pretty like.
00:08:05.016 - 00:08:06.160, Speaker B: It's not a good picture.
00:08:06.192 - 00:08:26.034, Speaker A: It's not great. I want to give you your laurels a little bit here, too. I think I mentioned this on last week's pod, but you've been saying for months that they shouldn't, it shouldn't have been seven cuts. Yeah. At the time I recall you saying, well, first of all, just like even when the data was much better, you're like, there's no need for the cuts. Like, the economy is doing well. And it's almost like, well, maybe you would.
00:08:26.034 - 00:08:44.740, Speaker A: This is where they start to get in the rock and the hard place really bad. Right. Because it's like, well, if the economy, the real economy, the everyday people, their costs, like for their rent, their houses, their food, maybe they need some relief. And like that could be cuts. But if you cut, maybe inflation goes higher. Yeah.
00:08:44.772 - 00:08:57.092, Speaker B: So they're dealing with an insane credibility issue right now. And so when Powell came out and was like, oh, we're still cutting three. And we're like, it doesn't really make any sense to cut three.
00:08:57.268 - 00:08:57.652, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:57.708 - 00:09:43.800, Speaker B: Like the market is starting to challenge their credibility. And the way you see it challenged in markets is some of this interest rate pricing. But what I like to look at as well is inflation sort of expectations and market based inflation expectations. And basically over the past couple of months, you've seen implied inflation tick, tick higher and higher. And so the market was basically like calling the fed's bluff in a way, being like, guys, do you think doing what you're currently doing is going to cause inflation to come down? No, the expectations started to move higher and then you start getting into the terminal state of this. Right. What does this look like a couple years from now? And the fiscal situation is really insane right now.
00:09:43.800 - 00:10:11.326, Speaker B: I heard today that it's April 20, right. So we were probably 150 days into the year or something like that, and the deficit's already one and a half trillion dollars. We're, I think, on pace for something like four. No, like two and a half on the year, which is still a lot. A lot. And I think that's what you're kind of seeing in commodity prices right now. The gold, the silver charts are some of the most compelling things I've ever seen.
00:10:11.326 - 00:10:32.114, Speaker B: Silver is about to be at a five. I think it's around a five year high, and it's breaking out. Gold is obviously at fresh all time highs, and that's in the face of a way stronger dollar, much higher real rates. And so you're seeing that correlation breakdown that we talked about in the context of bitcoin, but you're seeing that correlation breakdown in gold.
00:10:32.894 - 00:10:39.286, Speaker A: Like, I'm literally, the world is basically like avoiding or dumping us debt or buying, asking for, you know, for it to be cheaper.
00:10:39.390 - 00:10:39.766, Speaker B: Yes.
00:10:39.830 - 00:10:42.674, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. While paying more for gold. I mean, there. Yes.
00:10:43.054 - 00:10:51.094, Speaker B: And there are central banks buying this stuff. Like why it's so compelling is that these central banks that have money printers are using those money printers to buy.
00:10:51.134 - 00:10:53.034, Speaker A: Real assets like gold and silver.
00:10:54.094 - 00:11:09.986, Speaker B: And so that's why, like, if bitcoin, like, if it is going to be in that realm of assets, real money debasement hedges, it's got such a promising future because the macro world is freaking out right now. And that's why gold is ripping.
00:11:10.050 - 00:11:30.186, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about bitcoin and the crypto complex too, because, I mean, bitcoin is at these prices maybe like 18 or 20% off its all time high, which was 73, eight or so, I guess, only several weeks ago. I've written about this. That's actually extremely common during the major bull runs. We've seen 20, 30%. Correct? Yeah. Like seven or eight of them sometimes. Right.
00:11:30.186 - 00:11:54.474, Speaker A: Like, so, like, okay, like for context, that's fine. Also, it has dipped historically before the having, which is just a day or two away. But also the geopolitics, the iranian retaliatory missile attack on Israel happened last Saturday. All the other world's markets are closed, basically. But bitcoin was open and it dropped significantly. Right on the headline. Right, correct.
00:11:54.474 - 00:12:23.908, Speaker A: But then I would say the market opened on Monday eventually. So did like bitcoin. How much of this? Obviously, we sort of trending below all time highs before. But is this a reaction to. It's a risk asset. I'm able to sell it over the weekend. And then bitcoin sort of struggling to recover from that sale up in the 68, 69 area because people are like, well, maybe it was a little overheated.
00:12:23.908 - 00:12:33.678, Speaker A: I mean, how do you think about where bitcoin is? Or is? Or is it, it sort of just kind of noise? It's still at this point, I mean, no, I mean, to be clear, it's 61k is a nice, healthy, high bitcoin price.
00:12:33.766 - 00:12:55.350, Speaker B: I think last year we were here this time and we're talking 22. Yeah. And so it's obviously had a huge run. And that basically highlights the fact that there's a lot of long positioning in the asset. And so I think what you've had over the past couple of weeks is just a healthy flush out of positioning, consolidation.
00:12:55.462 - 00:12:59.566, Speaker A: You know, there was a large leverage. A lot of leverage came off.
00:12:59.590 - 00:13:15.894, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And so I think the trend is still intact. And I'm looking at something like the hundred day moving average to kind of confirm to me that we're still trending higher. And that's right around 57k. So you still have a ton of room.
00:13:16.054 - 00:13:22.342, Speaker A: And a lot of people have said, like, 58 is a reasonable, like that would also make sense. Yeah, no, to just look at the charts and stuff.
00:13:22.438 - 00:13:33.906, Speaker B: And I think, like, you know, sometimes it's better to look at the big picture charts, like look at the monthly candles and stuff and, you know, not get too caught up in the day to day noise.
00:13:33.970 - 00:13:47.922, Speaker A: And it is funny. Cause like, if you look at, like I said, if you look at 61 and you say, oh my gosh, we're down. Yeah, like you said, I mean, we were doing this pod in January 23, it was 16 six or something, I think in the first episode of the year last year. So, like, I mean, you know, yeah.
00:13:47.978 - 00:13:53.434, Speaker B: Now tons of like ETF inflows, more people interested than ever.
00:13:53.514 - 00:14:29.680, Speaker A: And a lot of those platforms that we've been talking about being the main net new accessible market, like the wealth advisors and the financial advisor platforms, they're still not turned on. So, but, but it does seem like those flows, just on the flows, we saw some incredible inflows, I think something like 14 or so billion in inflows, net inflows, not including or, you know, net of the grayscale outflows. That was before any of those platforms turned on. So I guess we assume, I mean, not that they weren't all institutions, but they were people buying institutions too, but retail on like brokerage platforms, basically.
00:14:29.752 - 00:14:30.444, Speaker B: Yep.
00:14:30.944 - 00:14:53.656, Speaker A: Those have really sort of dried up over, I mean, it's been less every week for like the last four weeks. So has everyone. Now, this is an impossible question to ask, but it leads me to ask, has any everyone now that apparently did want to get it through their brokerage account and could and did. Like, there's no more dry powder there. It seems like retail has allocated.
00:14:53.720 - 00:15:20.122, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think historically, if you look, you know, some of this flow activities related to tax season and stuff. And so, you know, typically, I do think you start to see an uptick in retail involvement in risk markets in terms of, like, equity inflows and stuff. So there's a case to be made that, yeah, the people that got access to it have allocated already, but there's still so many people that don't have access that so many platforms that haven't been turned on.
00:15:20.178 - 00:15:20.394, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:20.434 - 00:15:21.978, Speaker B: You know, vanguards of the world.
00:15:22.026 - 00:15:29.426, Speaker A: So, I mean, sort of like, wave one maybe has played out a little bit and, like, wave two is yet to happen. Yeah, maybe at the end of the.
00:15:29.450 - 00:15:38.338, Speaker B: Day, I mean, it's like you just have to think about what your trade is when you're buying bitcoin and your trade is short dollars. Yeah, and I'm happily short dollars.
00:15:38.426 - 00:15:42.330, Speaker A: There you go. Bimnet abibi, my friend from galaxy trading. Thanks for coming at Galaxy brands.
00:15:42.402 - 00:15:43.214, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:15:45.034 - 00:15:50.214, Speaker A: Let's go now to our guest, sam Callahan, senior analyst at Swan. Sam, welcome to Galaxy Brains.
00:15:50.874 - 00:15:54.752, Speaker D: Thanks, Alex. Long time, listeners. Day one, man, wow.
00:15:54.848 - 00:16:07.064, Speaker A: You might be the only one. I like to think we've gotten better at it since the. Since day one. Actually, don't go back and listen to the first couple episodes. We were finding our footing, dude. Sam. Yeah.
00:16:07.064 - 00:17:00.156, Speaker A: I'm super happy to have you on. I love your show, Swan signal also, and you're one of the more intelligent analysts, I think, and I would say measured analysts covering bitcoin macro and the interplay between the two. We've got a bunch of fun topics we want to discuss, but let's start with just the bitcoin price. It's what, 61k as we record today on April 17, that's like maybe 20% off that new all time high of 73, eight or so. And it's just about to be the halving big question. Where are we in the cycle? Is that still a thing? Are we early? Did we speed run the cycle? What are your thoughts about how bitcoin is trading over the last period and where you think we might be? For context, I said a couple of weeks ago that we might be in the late third inning again. That's literally back of the napkin.
00:17:00.156 - 00:17:03.384, Speaker A: Just made that up. But it felt like we weren't early, but we weren't late.
00:17:04.524 - 00:17:39.324, Speaker D: Yeah, it does feel like we're in the middle somewhere. That's what I would say. I understand why people might think that we're farther along than maybe the general market participants think. Because even if you look at the round trip from previous all time high back to previous all time high, it took like 470 days to get back to the previous all time high. This time previous cycles, that was over 700 days. And so we really pushed ahead. Part of that is the ETF's obviously the large amount of demand that came in from those.
00:17:39.324 - 00:18:09.056, Speaker D: So I think there's like, and there's a lot of speculation too. I mean, like, there was a moment there around, like the micro strategy when it was hitting like 1800. A lot of speculation, a lot of exuberance. There was a lot of meme coin action. There's like flying off, there's airdrops. And so if I'm just looking at this anecdotally and just like trying to get those, you know, alarm bells ringing, when I see, like, the behavior that resembles kind of like maybe a local top, I think the signs were there. And so, like, a pullback's completely normal in a bull market.
00:18:09.056 - 00:18:24.530, Speaker D: I mean, I know you've covered this too. There's multiple, you know, 20% plus drops. I think like five or six or seven. I mean, you would know better than me in the previous cycles during bull market. So it's completely normal. And I do think we had some, like, toppy behavior and needed a little bit of a cleanse. And I think that's healthy.
00:18:24.530 - 00:18:55.674, Speaker D: I think periods of consolidation are healthy to wipe out leverage. You know, any kind of short term traders that were coming in just trying to make a quick buck, they're kind of getting carted off with this volatility that's been extremely choppy. And as we go into the halving, it's kind of done what I expected. It's kind of rallied into the having, like previous havings. I think it's up like over 150% in the last 360 days. And that's kind of in line with previous havings leading up to it. And then typically it does well afterwards.
00:18:55.674 - 00:19:01.086, Speaker D: We can, I'll kind of stop there by kind of what I think afterwards, but I want to hear your thoughts.
00:19:01.150 - 00:19:36.002, Speaker A: No, I think that's right. I mean, I love your point. I totally agree. Tons of new token launches, like people launching tokens on bitcoin, that by definition can't actually even have utility in the defi cents. Right? Like, you can't build a Dex on bitcoin layer one. So your BRC 20 token, by definition, can't be a utility token to put into that Dex, like, to operate it right, let alone, like, all the straight up meme coins like that historically, you would think, is sort of like far out on the risk curve, like late cycle activity. And so, yeah, I agree.
00:19:36.002 - 00:20:17.084, Speaker A: Part of me thinks it's one way I think about that is that in the past, that's been late cycle activity, because so many new entrants come in and they get interested in things like dogecoin that aren't as fundamental. They're easier to understand, but they're like sort of something that newbies tend to do. Whereas it kind of felt to me, like, particularly starting in the fall, the sort of growth of meme coins was actually kind of like a cynicism from the existing crypto natives who made it this far. Like they weren't excited anymore by, like, defi, like, tokens. They weren't. They weren't out here talking about web3, but they were like, you know what? Like, this is like, straightforward. We can get behind just like making jokes on the blockchain.
00:20:17.084 - 00:20:50.084, Speaker A: And so maybe that counters a little bit. The idea that I don't think, I personally don't think, although I've heard of some of this activity increasing lately, but that it's like, such and such as friend or their barber, like, being like, how do I buy meme coins on Solana? I don't feel like we're there yet, so. And then, of course, the ETF's, I still think they. Frankly, we talked about this, I think, on your show, like, there's no. The advisor platforms aren't even here yet, so there presumably should be a pile of latent demand to still come that can drive additional inflows, I think, going forward, personally.
00:20:50.464 - 00:21:42.608, Speaker D: Yeah, no, Nidig put out a great report, actually, this morning about the having, and I read it and I actually found myself agreeing with. There's this one chart that I love, and it just talks about how each successive halving has a diminished effect when you just take into account the daily trading volumes. And so this current halving, it's going to be 450 bitcoin, which is like $31 million at a price of 70,000 bitcoin. And that only makes up like 59 basis points of the daily trading volume. Now, the first having, Nidek highlighted that that was over 10% back then, so it just has a diminishing effect. And so they were like, I think the halving actually has a minimal impact on price from the supply side. It's actually going to be more from the demand side from the ETF's, that latent demand that you just talked about.
00:21:42.608 - 00:22:04.904, Speaker D: I agree with Nidek. That's how I feel as well. It makes a lot of sense. But the one thing that I would say as a caveat is narratives are really powerful in markets. If people believe that the halving has this supply shock and it gets run with it, and mainstream media is talking about the having, everyone's saying the halving is coming. I mean, it will have an impact. There's going to be a lot of trading activity.
00:22:04.904 - 00:22:28.136, Speaker D: That's going to be volatility. I could see it sell off initially. That wouldn't surprise me at all, really. Nothing would surprise me, because if people believe it, it doesn't matter what I just said, that it's only a small amount of the daily trading volume. People will trade it and they'll buy because they think it's going to go up. So it's one of those things. I would love to hear your thoughts.
00:22:28.200 - 00:23:02.324, Speaker A: I do think it's a quadrennial marketing event. It's such a good way to learn about how bitcoin works, to learn about the having. It should be inherently bullish as an event, just that it did occur. But I think it honestly, bitcoin, so well known globally that, like, no one would be surprised that it did occur. It won't be like, oh, my gosh, look at it. The programmatic change did work, right? Everybody expects it to work because it will work and it has always happened. Well, this was only the fourth one, but, yeah, I think of it as, like, there's a lot more people learning about bitcoin.
00:23:02.324 - 00:23:33.794, Speaker A: There's a great opportunity to teach and learn about bitcoin. You've got way bigger, mature entrants in this market that are doing that teaching. I definitely agree with the point you made from Nydig. I've written this, too, that as a percentage of daily float, it's frankly minimal. Another report I saw this morning from Kareem Helmi at Thanefield Research, he was looking at minor selling pressure and his thesis, and there was data to back this up. You can find this on Twitter. Like, he tweeted the report and basically that just like, miners are actually, like, their.
00:23:33.794 - 00:24:03.294, Speaker A: Their margins are quite healthy right now, and so they're not actually selling their. What selling, they. They're mostly doing is. Is mostly discretionary. And so, like, on the, on the, I guess, anti bullish side that, like, oh, there'll be much less minor selling, to be clear, you already pointed out, like, it's not that much anyway, like, as a percentage of the daily trading volume, but like, also, like, they won't have to all of a sudden, like, they. They can absorb a 50% decline in revenue, a lot of them, at least in terms of their breakeven operating cost to mine a bitcoin.
00:24:03.674 - 00:24:28.534, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. I think actually we might see a little bit less of a drop in hash rate than people expect and difficulty. If you look at the breakeven rates of these rigs, I think he's spot on. And honestly, this price run up has been great for miners. The revenues with the fees, that was something for a while. In the coming weeks, that might spike back up. We'll see.
00:24:28.534 - 00:25:06.832, Speaker D: But there's reasons to believe that when you just look at hash price and some of these things, some of these factors, they're in a better shape. And then especially compared to 2022, in terms of their balance sheets, it's night and day. So in terms of just the health of their balance sheet, some of them have a lot of cash on hand to maybe do some m and a activity after the having. It's different. It's a totally different environment right now. I kind of spoke about this, which is like, the interesting thing with the having to me is that darwinian effect on the mining industry to kind of wipe out inefficient actors. I think it's beautiful.
00:25:06.832 - 00:25:49.474, Speaker D: I think it's beautiful. It actually causes them to become more efficient over time as a whole industry. And that's what the heaving really does. I mean, all that capital and all those resources are going to get shifted to better operators with cheaper sources of energy, with more efficient mining operations. And they're going to. It causes them to search for even cheaper sources of energy, stranded sources of energy, innovate, do things like waste, go to the waste fields and try to get energy from there, burn tires, do these really creative ways to get cheap energy. And so that's what the having really does in my mind, and that's what I find really fascinating about it.
00:25:49.474 - 00:25:53.700, Speaker D: Kind of be outside the price that everyone else seems to focus on.
00:25:53.852 - 00:26:27.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Love those thoughts. Okay, let's talk a little bit about some comments that were made because it jives with one of the big drawdowns. Like you said, there's been a lot of volatility and there's reasons why it's to be expected that you don't go up forever anyway. But last weekend there was Iran had a retaliatory strike on Israel. I think their first time ever directly themselves, attacking Israel on Saturday. And this created significant jitters in the world around geopolitical risk and what might come.
00:26:27.654 - 00:26:53.184, Speaker A: But of course, all markets were closed except bitcoin. And bitcoin dropped 10% in like five minutes after this happened. And you had mentioned, and I'm recalling that Andrew Ross Sorkin from CNBC had said, well, wait a second. Isn't it supposed to trade like a hedge? Isn't it supposed to be something that you buy during times of war? What was your take on his comment, and how did you view bitcoins reaction to that event?
00:26:54.484 - 00:27:49.144, Speaker D: Well, I was reminded of a quote from Morgan Hausel, and that was every investor is making a bet on the future, every single one of them. It's only called speculation when you disagree with them or on their time horizon. And so that's what I would say to Andrew Ralph Sorkin is like, obviously, when markets happen, there's always a knee jerk response and investors are going to sell what's the most liquid. And like you said, bitcoin trades over the weekend and it's liquid and it's available to sell. And it's usually the first to respond to events like this, especially when they happen outside of trading hours. But really what you got to do is zoom out and say, like, what would rising geopolitical conflicts or tensions, how would that be beneficial or undermine bitcoin's long term value proposition? And when you think about war, war is highly inflationary. I mean, there's no doubt about it.
00:27:49.144 - 00:28:22.476, Speaker D: I mean, just when you look at things like a disruption in supply chains or a breakdown in trade relations, it just adds friction, which leads to rising cost of goods, rising gasoline prices, rising commodity prices across the board, which leads to inflationary pressures. And then you have the spending. I mean, the spending. Wars are expensive. Government spending really spikes in all wars. I did some study a couple years ago looking into this. When Ukraine was invaded by Russia during the civil war, the US debt was $65 million.
00:28:22.476 - 00:28:50.150, Speaker D: By the end of the war, it was $2.6 billion. That's almost a 40 fold increase during world War two. Here's a stat like if you spent 100 million per day, 365 days a year, every single hour, you spent $1 million for 365 days a year. It would take you 576 years to spend what we spent during World War two. And so government spending spikes. And how do they do that? They do it through currency devaluation.
00:28:50.150 - 00:29:06.510, Speaker D: They print the money or they borrow the money. I mean, you can raise taxes, but we don't do that anymore. We either borrow the money or we devalue the currency. And so you don't want to hold that. You want to hold hard, scarce assets. And that's what you look at the data. You know, bonds don't really perform well.
00:29:06.510 - 00:29:31.314, Speaker D: You don't want to own the thing that they're going to be flooding with new supply as they borrow money to fund their war efforts. And cash does really poor. You don't want to own the thing they're devaluing. You want to own hard, scarce assets. And so if I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin, I would say Zoom out and think about the actual long term implications of what's going on here because you're going to want to hold hard ass scare sets in that environment. So that's what I would say to him.
00:29:31.394 - 00:30:08.154, Speaker A: That makes sense. And along the same lines, you're talking about not wanting to own bonds, for example. And we have flooded the market with new treasury issuance in general. I mean, it's like crazy the amount of fiscal spend that the government is doing in general, right? I've seen the stat that's like adding a trillion to the deficit to the national debt every hundred days. There's been a. You raised this chart with me that gold and bonds, I guess we should say yields, but like on an inverse, the value of bonds has been declining while the gold price has been increasing. And for literally decades they traded the same.
00:30:08.154 - 00:30:20.146, Speaker A: Because in times of crisis, us debt was thought to be a really good hedge. But now, en masse, or at least on the margins, people are selling debt and buying gold. What does that tell you, Steven?
00:30:20.170 - 00:31:06.408, Speaker D: Yeah, it's this breakdown in this relationship between the inverted real yields and gold. It's really fascinating because to me it just shows either there's going to be a reversion to the mean and gold's going to break down, maybe, or that relationship's changing and gold sniffing out something and bitcoin is doing something similar. People were like, bitcoin won't do well in a rising interest rate environment. But here we are, bitcoin's ripping at the end of 2023 and 2024 in a high interest rate environment. And I think both of those things are very similar. And it's towards this increased awareness of the unsustainable nature of the fiscal situation. I mean, you're not even just hearing it from bitcoin.
00:31:06.408 - 00:31:55.796, Speaker D: You're actually hearing bitcoiner arguments in the mainstream from even the people at the CBO or Jerome Powell himself saying unsustainable the IMF came out yesterday and they just said, something's got to give here. In terms of the US fiscal situation, I think that's what bitcoin and gold are really sniffing out. And it doesn't really matter as much what the Fed's going to do with interest rates, because if they raise interest rates, it increases the interest expense and blasts open the fiscal deficit even more. It actually worsens the fiscal situation. And if they lower rates, that's going to be beneficial for asset prices and things are going to go up there that's inflationary as well. There's inflationary pressures across the board for the Fed. If they keep interest rates high, if they jack interest rates down, same thing happens.
00:31:55.796 - 00:32:31.102, Speaker D: And I think gold and bitcoin are sniffing that out. And the last thing I'll say is the Fed. The Fed has said multiple times that it has surgical tools to deal with financial instability concerns, whether that's liquidity in the treasury market. They have surgical tools they can use. And so they don't even have to touch the interest rates. They can do something else like the bank term funding program, or the reverse repo is getting drained down right now, or the treasury can come over and do something with the treasury general account. All of those are inadvertently inflationary in the end, without touching the interest rate policy.
00:32:31.102 - 00:32:53.546, Speaker D: So that's potentially why you're seeing this divergence, because gold is like, I don't really care as much anymore about this interest rate policy. You're going to do other things that are inflationary and it's actually just a worsening fiscal situation. And I'm totally diverting now because this is a new regime change that we're in right now. And so those are my thoughts around that. But it's a fascinating chart.
00:32:53.690 - 00:33:42.034, Speaker A: It is. I love the way you say sniffing out, because it really feels now that in the investing community, again, bitcoin aside, that it used to be like doomsang gold bugs that were banging the table about government debt and unsustainable debt and fiscal malprudence and the Fed printing money, these doomsayers that were right, like a broken clock is right twice a day, but now it doesn't feel like they're fringe at all. In fact, Jamie Dimon has said that he's the CEO of the largest bank in the world has said that something is wrong that has to change. And so it seems like it's straight up consensus now that the US government is terrible at managing money and that, like. And so now it's no longer anyway, so that's a real shift.
00:33:42.854 - 00:34:29.614, Speaker D: Yeah. It had me thinking, whenever something becomes consensus, it's usually not a great thing for your investments. And it's the first time I've heard really, bitcoiner narratives really start to take hold from notable people in traditional finance. They might as well be bitcoiners. The way that they're speaking about the fiscal situation, the money printing, it's something that bitcoin has been talking about for years, and gold bugs to their credit. But now the awareness is really the last two months or so, you've seen a lot of people, Ken Griffin come out, Larry Fink came out, said something similar. You mentioned Jamie Dimon, Joan Powell.
00:34:29.614 - 00:34:31.258, Speaker D: The list goes on.
00:34:31.426 - 00:35:12.714, Speaker A: Jay Powell. This is one of the things bim net Abibi has been like, effectively, like, criticizing Jay Powell about is like, you know, he's getting asked these questions during the FOMC press conferences and he can't say what everyone knows, which is like, the fiscal impulse is a huge part of this because he's trying so hard to maintain, like, independence so that he's not like, you know, criticizing the federal government. And instead he's focusing on, you know, the dual mandate of the Fed, which doesn't include policing or commenting on government spending. Right. It involves supporting the economy through employment and inflation. Right. Keeping inflation down.
00:35:12.714 - 00:35:40.358, Speaker A: But it shouldn't have been, like a monumental thing for him to point out that on 60 minutes a couple of weeks ago, whenever that was, that, yes, it's ultimately unsustainable. That's pretty much all he said. But it's like, dude, thank you for finally acknowledging it. Yeah. Because it's. I mean, again, it's just like, I don't think people can calculate. It's kind of like, it's a little bit like thinking about distances in outer space, like, to actually calculate how much money we're talking about.
00:35:40.358 - 00:35:51.646, Speaker A: I did some math last week. It was like, it's like $200 million added to the national debt, like every 30 minutes or something, which is like a buck 50 per us household every 30 minutes.
00:35:51.710 - 00:35:52.942, Speaker D: Funny money. Yeah.
00:35:53.038 - 00:36:11.978, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I don't. People don't have a real conception of that. Um, so it does have you looking for something else. It does. And I think, you know, there's education. That's the other thing that's interesting because the US has had so much, such a long period of, you know, dollar dominance, you know, relative economic prosperity, et cetera, et cetera.
00:36:11.978 - 00:36:29.738, Speaker A: Right. And like, you know, improvement of life conditions and whatnot. Americans are really not prepared to deal with sustained inflation, whereas there are many other countries where this is, like, well known how to deal with this. Right. Like you get argentinian pesos and you immediately buy something with them that will hold its value. Right. You dump them immediately.
00:36:29.738 - 00:36:49.610, Speaker A: Right. But Americans don't, aren't really used to that. And so I feel like the uptake actually is a little slower on, you see it in some of the markets. But, like, I don't know of a lot of Americans buying gold. I think a lot of that's like foreign actors, central banks that are reducing or. Right. So, like, when are Americans going to learn?
00:36:49.802 - 00:37:21.938, Speaker D: No, it's spot on. I remember there was a report. It looked at, it might have been the biz or n bars, but it looked at the sensitivity of populations to rising cost of living. And if they had experienced them recently in their lives, whether that's one generation prior or two generations prior, they were much more sensitive to price rises, which led to quicker rates of inflation as they dumped the dollars or whatever local currency it was. You're right. The United States hasn't really experienced that. And so I think.
00:37:21.938 - 00:37:44.674, Speaker D: I think the data kind of proves what you just said, which is that there is like a slower, you know, realization in the United States. It's also like culturally, you know, in other cultures who have dealt with this, they're a little bit more self sufficient. Right. They don't depend on, you know, they. They may be help chickens or something at home. Right, right. You don't have to buy everything, you know? You know.
00:37:44.674 - 00:38:00.150, Speaker D: Yeah. They're. Culturally, they understand that they can't really depend on stability in the financial system or the monetary system there because they've lived through that. Americans, not so much. So it's definitely something to keep in mind.
00:38:00.262 - 00:38:29.270, Speaker A: Preston, we talked about gold diverging and sniffing this out. I saw an interview on Fox Business, or I guess even a debate, I would call it, between Natalie Brunel and Peter Schiff, well known gold lover, bitcoin hater. I actually got to say, I think he's one of the best posters on twitter.com dot. His posts are hilarious, hilariously. Well, well written trolls often. But he's like, he's, he's out here actually saying, well, Natalie, the price of bitcoin went down, and look at gold.
00:38:29.270 - 00:38:37.474, Speaker A: It was up $22. Like, how do you square that? Like, why, why was that a dumb statement, will you tell me? Because it sounded. It sounded pretty dumb.
00:38:37.934 - 00:38:54.122, Speaker D: I mean, look, it's just, it's just cherry picking. I mean. I mean, there's no way like, he's. It's so ridiculous because he's also like, it outperformed two and a half years. And I'm like, well, that's mighty specific timeframe, Peter. I can do that too. And it's like, bitcoin's outperform gold.
00:38:54.122 - 00:39:14.054, Speaker D: Three months, six months, one year, two year, four year, five year, six year. It's blown it out of the water. And anybody with a chart and two eyeballs can see that. Except Peter, apparently. So it's kind of like cherry picking. It's a little disingenuous. He picks the pico top of the last bull market, that timeframe, and then takes into account the entire bear market.
00:39:14.054 - 00:40:08.658, Speaker D: But he's got to find it because I said if I close my eyes and threw a dart at a calendar going back ten years, there's like a 95% chance it lands on a date that bitcoin outperformed gold over that timeframe. And the one thing I'll say, the really interesting thing was when he talks about the intrinsic value of gold, of why bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value and gold does, because it's used in jewelry and electronics and dentistry or whatever. And I just thought it was ridiculous because the very next sentence is, well, central banks are buying gold. And I was like, well, why are they buying gold? They're buying gold for its monetary properties. Most of gold's valuation is its monetary premium, not its use cases, industrial use cases. The central banks are not buying gold because maybe they're worried about inflation. They're thinking about taking out a second job.
00:40:08.658 - 00:40:28.554, Speaker D: They're going to open up a dental practice with their rising gold inventories. Or they're building electronics in the basement of the central banks. Makes no sense. They're buying it for the monetary properties. That's exactly why people are buying bitcoin. Except bitcoin improves upon some of gold's shortcomings. It's more portable and divisible and verifiable.
00:40:28.554 - 00:40:49.022, Speaker D: And so that's the value of bitcoin. It's the same as the value of most of the value of gold, of a significant portion of gold's value is tied to its monetary premium. So that just, it just grinds my gears when Peter says that, because it's just like so silly. It's like a silly argument.
00:40:49.118 - 00:41:33.536, Speaker A: Yeah, there's some cognitive dissonance there for sure. I also wanted to ask you, Sam, you've been following the stablecoin thing, and I think it's relevant to this whole conversation because we're talking about the value and power of the dollar and, you know, and the ownership of us government debt and by the way, that's used to spend and the fiscal rights all tied together. And I think there's some progress. It looks like perhaps it's early. I mean, who knows whether it's viable. But on legislation in the US that would formalize and legalize officially stable coins, and we don't have to talk about the specific details of where that stands. But the stable coins already today, but I believe under proposed rules, basically have to buy treasuries.
00:41:33.536 - 00:41:50.284, Speaker A: So that's good because they'd be a net buyer of debt at just the time when we happen to be printing as much of it as we can. How do you think about stable coins in relation to the dollar? Maybe in relation to bitcoin or crypto markets? What's interesting to you, if anything, about stable coins and american power?
00:41:50.784 - 00:42:56.334, Speaker D: Steven? Well, I think you touched on it very well. If they're going to have to keep printing money, which, or borrowing a lot of money, let's say, and not have the Fed monetize that, but try to find other buyers in the market, they're going to need to find people like stablecoin providers. It's ironic because we know tether owns more treasury bonds than entire countries. They're almost in the top ten, I think, in terms of the holdings of their treasuries. And the government's going to need that because if they try to issue a bunch of bonds, they can't let interest rates spike. When they do that, they need to find some kind of demand, and the stablecoin providers can do that. But it's been really interesting because when I look out these large international financial institutions like the bank of international settlements, the IMF, the financial stability board, and even the politicians in the United States, they are worried about stable coins much more than bitcoin.
00:42:56.334 - 00:43:37.898, Speaker D: They are focused on stable coins. Theyre really worried about it being a way for locals to turn to during periods of instability, which would worsen a hyperinflation crisis. It would be an escape hatch for them, make dollars accessible, really cause issues for that local central bank and local government. If people can just escape to stable coins, which they are doing, I mean, the market caps blown up to over $175 billion. I mean, you can't deny that people want access to dollars because it is, I guess, the best fiat out there. I mean, there's no doubt about it. And so the demand is there.
00:43:37.898 - 00:44:14.758, Speaker D: And so it's been really interesting because their focus isn't on bitcoin, it's on stable coins. And I've read the, the custodia master account order. When they were denied, a lot of people thought it was about the fact that they wanted to be a fully reserved bank. And the Fed didn't want that because we live in a fractional reserve banking system and the fully reserved bank would suck capital out. That would call banking crisis. And that wasn't it. When I read the order, it was really, they didn't want more connections occurring between the crypto asset ecosystem and the traditional financial system.
00:44:14.758 - 00:44:42.814, Speaker D: They specifically say their business model focused on the crypto. We don't want more connections happening between the traditional financial system. Just look at what happened to Silicon Valley bank. Obviously, that's hilarious because Circle and Silicon Valley bank circles reserve got stuck on there. But it was because of the instability of the traditional banking system was why that became an issue, not the fact that it was a stable coin. But the Fed is arguing we don't want more connections. Look at that.
00:44:42.814 - 00:45:21.394, Speaker D: But then they're also, we don't like the fact that, that you are planning to issue a stable coin, your avits. And they specifically say we have to manage monetary policy and we don't know how this will impact our ability to do that or impact our balance sheet. And so that was really a signpost to me, because I'm like, people thought it was about the fact they were a fully reserved bank. They were really concerned about the stablecoin. They did not want more connections, and they were concerned about the fact that there is stablecoin. And that's just my takeaway from reading the order. But the stablecoin developments, I think we're about to see something.
00:45:21.394 - 00:46:01.610, Speaker D: Tether is a very, it's out there and I think they're going to try to bring them into compliance. I don't know what that looks like. I don't know what the outcome is right now. They're benefiting by owning all those treasuries, collecting that interest, and they're buying bitcoin with it. So that's very interesting dynamics going on, but the way that they are attacking stable coins. Not attacking, but they're just very conscientious of what's going on in the stablecoin market. I do see legislation getting passed and them getting brought into more oversight and more compliance and whatever that looks like, I'm not sure, but I think that's something that I would bet on for the next, let's say, having epoch.
00:46:01.802 - 00:46:40.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I agree. Maybe not in the next, you know, six to nine months leading into this election, but like, in the next two or four years, I think it's almost certain. It seems like the thing they care almost the most about. And I think it's basically been positioned as something that they also have to deal with KYC, illicit finance issues alongside with that. I think they're both. I bet you if we get stable coin legislation, you'll see something dropped in around, like surveillance as well for crypto assets broadly. And I think, you know, hopefully, if that happens, it's not something that kills the industry because it tries to attack software developers like some proposals we've seen.
00:46:40.594 - 00:47:07.754, Speaker A: Yeah. Sam, before we wrap, tell us about Swann and what you guys are seeing in the market. I've been seeing that Swann is growing a lot, but from your vantage point, are people, are you seeing a lot more new bitcoiners come in or are they buying bitcoin or are they, do they keep it on custody? I mean, I don't know. Just what insights do you see from your seat at Swann about the way this market is playing out right now?
00:47:08.614 - 00:47:51.152, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, coming into January, I mean, Swann's seen record trading volumes, basically, and new interest and new demand. And personally, Corey said something like the ETF multiplier effect. It's just this idea, like people have talked about it, but it's just like a new top of funnel. There's just more interest in this. And traditional financial institutions, the largest, most credible ones, now educating their clients about the merits of owning bitcoin. And a percentage of those people, maybe they're going to buy the ETF and it's more accessible, it's convenient. But as they keep learning about it, it's my belief that a portion of those are going to want to buy spot bitcoin.
00:47:51.152 - 00:48:21.716, Speaker D: You are seeing from everyone I talk to into the industry. It's not just swan, it's really any of these bitcoin brokerage companies. They're seeing a ton of new demand after these ETF's, along with the price rise, obviously. And I think we're going to continue to see that multiplier effect because spot bitcoin offers advantages to an ETF. I think it's, obviously, it doesn't have annual fees, but there's also a bit of capital efficiency, I guess there's no fees right now anyway.
00:48:21.860 - 00:48:24.532, Speaker A: And you can use the bitcoin. You can spend it on.
00:48:24.588 - 00:48:26.572, Speaker D: That's what I mean. Yeah, exactly.
00:48:26.628 - 00:48:27.648, Speaker A: Exactly. Right.
00:48:27.796 - 00:48:28.884, Speaker D: I can't send.
00:48:29.944 - 00:48:34.896, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't send you those shares for payment, like over global instant settlement network, no matter where I am. Right?
00:48:34.920 - 00:48:39.232, Speaker D: Like, yeah, that's all, yeah, that's all. Yeah, I think, right.
00:48:39.288 - 00:48:54.624, Speaker A: There's no counterparty risk. And the top of the funnel does some of the heavy lifting on getting people interested. And then the sales pitch is now a little different. It's sort of like, that's the top of the funnel. And now the spot bitcoin companies go and explain, well, wait a second, like, you're only getting half the deal with bitcoin. You should actually.
00:48:54.744 - 00:49:20.912, Speaker D: Yeah, there's going to be a portion, right. But the amount of flows that the ETF's have seen, the interest, I mean, even if it's a percentage of that, that goes like, hey, I actually want to own at least some spot bitcoin. That's still significant in terms of the increased demand. And so I think that's going to continue with the ETF's. It's just like a different type of funnel. It's a better top of funnel than before where it was a little bit more confusing. I think you kind of went in there yourself.
00:49:20.912 - 00:49:51.306, Speaker D: But now we have, like, handholding from the ETF providers out there who are very credible institutions, who are not educating their clients about bitcoin. And so they're doing the heavy lifting, like you said. And so we're seeing that. And then a lot of our clients take self custody. I mean, I think that's part of the education that we do. But it's a very high percentage of our clients who take self custody of their bitcoin off the platform at Swan, which is what we want to see. We want them taking self custody.
00:49:51.306 - 00:50:16.604, Speaker D: That's good for them to use bitcoin as it's meant to be used, as well as it's good for the network, in my opinion, to have it more distributed, held by individuals. We see a lot of that. We see a lot of that. It's been good for the industry. I think bull markets, all boats rise a little bit, too. I think that's part of what's going on. I think the ETF's are a big part of it.
00:50:17.504 - 00:50:23.564, Speaker A: Awesome. Sam, tell the audience where they can find you online and how to stay in touch.
