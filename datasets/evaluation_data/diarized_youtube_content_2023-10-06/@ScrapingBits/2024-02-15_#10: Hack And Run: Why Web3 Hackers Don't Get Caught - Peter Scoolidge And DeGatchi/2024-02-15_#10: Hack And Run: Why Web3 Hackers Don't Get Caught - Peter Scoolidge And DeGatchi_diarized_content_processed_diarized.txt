00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.400, Speaker A: I'm not aware of anyone ever successfully doing hackers and winning, especially if they're in another country. At best, U. S. Law enforcement like the FBI maybe would do some kind of joint investigation and prosecution with the jurisdiction where that person's located. But the amount of times that happens is very limited by resources, and the know only the biggest and most notorious cybercrimes usually are being addressed that way.
00:00:31.930 - 00:00:39.110, Speaker B: GM. GM, everyone. My name's Togatchi, the host of scraping bits, and today I'm with a special guest, Peter, how's it going?
00:00:39.180 - 00:00:41.514, Speaker A: It's going well. Digotchi, thank you for having me today.
00:00:41.632 - 00:00:45.690, Speaker B: Thanks for coming on. Just for some context, who are you and what do you do?
00:00:45.760 - 00:01:03.038, Speaker A: I'm a lawyer, and I'm based in New York. I have a small law firm called schoolage, Peters, Rosati and Fox LLP. It's been open since 2019, and we focus quite a bit on technology law issues, including web three and crypto stuff.
00:01:03.124 - 00:01:10.030, Speaker B: How did you get into the whole law thing? Were you doing it? Were you always interested in, or did it just kind of come out of the blue?
00:01:10.110 - 00:02:15.990, Speaker A: I was going to college back in 2001 in Manhattan, and I was studying to become a business major, and I took a business law class, by coincidence, as part of the requirements. And I found law in the format of law to be something that I was just really interested in and happened to be good at. Also the format of rules, exceptions, learning those things and then applying them to a fact pattern to get usually two different positions that are kind of adverse to each other. So I took that class, did really well in it, and then I switched my major to political science because I wanted to take more kind of like, law related classes and applied to law school. Went to law school at night for four years. And then I graduated and started working at a firm in Manhattan called Khalee, Gordon, and Reindell, where we handled some securities fraud cases, other types of financial services matters. We worked on anti money laundering investigations.
00:02:15.990 - 00:02:54.862, Speaker A: We did some First Amendment stuff and a little bit of technology related stuff, but not a ton at that point. Did that for about three years, and then I got an opportunity to work for a federal judge in Brooklyn. So I went and took that opportunity, and that was great. Learned a lot about what litigation looks like from the inside. When you're a judge and you get presented with two opposing positions and you have to decide who's right, who's going to win, and why in a way that isn't too assailable on appeal. Because people lose. They're unhappy, and they want to second guess you in appellate courts.
00:02:54.862 - 00:04:35.934, Speaker A: So I did that, and then after I finished up that clerkship, that was a one year position, I was hired to work as the first associate at a technology patent infringement firm, which was where I really kind of started to get deeper into technology in a professional context, because a lot of the patents that we were litigating were patents on things like interfaces for electronics, compression system, operating system, compression, payment systems. We had these two trials in Texas related to patents that were for a method of activating gift cards. This is, like, late 1990s technology, where retailers, they used to put live gift cards on the shelf that had value on them, and people would go and just steal them, right? And then go use them at different locations. So the guy who got these patents, he said, well, you know what you should do is you should have the card sitting there on a shelf, and then when you bring it to the point of sale to the cash register, you swipe it through. At that point, it's assigned an account number, and that account is given value based on the amount of money someone gave at the point of sale, which is pretty obvious, right? Pretty straightforward. So he gets these two patents and proceeds to, for the next ten years, just beat all these different companies over the head with them and get all these settlements, because everybody at that point, by the early 2000s, had started doing that with gift cards using point of sale activations. So he made, I think, $50 million of those patents.
00:04:35.934 - 00:05:09.818, Speaker A: And, wow. Then he sued a bunch of retailers, all of whom were using this one kind of intermediary to activate their gift card programs. And the law firm I was working at at the time defended them. So we had a trial for Barnes and Noble. We defended Barnes and noble. We won that trial, and then the next on the list was JCPenney, and we won that trial. And then after that, the plaintiff just fell apart and stopped trying the cases, and then we invalidated his patents in the federal circuit.
00:05:09.818 - 00:05:14.800, Speaker A: So put an end to that run that he had there.
00:05:15.330 - 00:05:18.658, Speaker B: Put an end to the run. Oh, no. Wow.
00:05:18.744 - 00:05:51.142, Speaker A: Yeah. But that was cool. And in the process of doing that, I learned a lot about payments. I learned about payment card information. I learned about all the different bank rails that point of sale transactions go through to get to visa or the bank that issued the card. That was pretty interesting. So I did the patent infringement litigation thing for a few years, and then in 2015, I left and started my own firm, which at the time, was called schoolage Kleiman LLP.
00:05:51.142 - 00:06:39.638, Speaker A: It was with a friend of mine from law school, Josh Kleiman. And in 2016, he started representing the Nano project, which was a token that had been issued in 2014, I think, for the first time. And they needed some help setting up different entities and figuring out if they wanted to use any kind of intellectual property protection on their protocol, that type of thing, and down the road a little ways. Their token had been listed on this exchange called Bitgrail, which was based in Italy. And Bitgrail was hacked by people who are unknown to this day. I think there was, like, $170,000,000 in tokens stolen off the exchange and. Yeah, gone without a trace.
00:06:39.638 - 00:07:14.694, Speaker A: Yes. And the response by some was to sue the developers of the token protocol along with the firm. At that point, Josh had left my firm and became the general counsel of Nano, some of the nano entities. So he hired my firm to defend the securities class action, which was filed by some crypto lawyers in New York, and so began a multi year representation of the nano project and numerous securities. Yeah. Which we eventually won.
00:07:14.812 - 00:07:29.466, Speaker B: How does, like, a whole multi year kind of thing go? What's the process of that? Basically, like, multiple years must be very lengthy. And if you're taking on multiple clients, then how do you kind of keep it fresh in mind?
00:07:29.568 - 00:07:50.754, Speaker A: Well, litigation progresses very slowly, so any lawyer who does litigation anyway for transactions, usually has anywhere between, like, 15 and 30 clients at the same time. And usually there's some kind of short term need for one or two of those clients, but never do they all have some kind of pressing short term need all at the same time.
00:07:50.872 - 00:07:51.154, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:51.192 - 00:08:50.806, Speaker A: So a case gets filed is a document called the complaint, which sets forth the basics of the claims, the facts that are underlying the claims, that type of thing. You get that, and you then have some period of time to respond to it. You can either attack it and say, even if what they're saying is true in here, they don't win because XYZ reasons. You can answer it and say, we deny everything, and we're going to proceed in this case and make our defenses in summary judgment or at trial. And every time something is supposed to happen in a litigation, there's, like, a long period of time preceding it. They're not quick moving things, usually. So the first case was filed, I think, in 2018, and we kind of took, like, a halfway position in that case where we were going to move to dismiss, but we ended up reaching a settlement pretty early in the case, which was supposed to be confidential, but the plaintiff's lawyers then told everyone about it.
00:08:50.806 - 00:09:12.538, Speaker A: In the second case, that they filed. So they settled the first case, and we thought, okay, great, that's it. Now we can move on. But we didn't settle it on a class wide basis. So it was a class action. It was supposed to be a class action, but we only settled with one person. So the plaintiff's lawyers said, let's go find another person.
00:09:12.538 - 00:09:52.266, Speaker A: So they found another person in California this time. I think they thought they would have a better venue in California, maybe be more favorable. So they filed in California, in the northern district, which, by the way, is a pretty famous and well traveled technology law jurisdiction because of all the Silicon Valley companies that are based there. So we had the case. I think this is in 2019. It's about a year after the settlement they filed this other case. And this case, obviously, the client was not going to settle, because the client was like, well, if I settled with them once and they sue us again, why are we going to settle this time around? So we fought the case really hard.
00:09:52.266 - 00:10:32.274, Speaker A: We made two motions to dismiss. We made one motion. I think it was granted largely in part, but a few claims survived. Then we made a second motion, and I think we got them down to, like, one claim, but the judge just wouldn't dismiss the entire case. Then it came time for them to certify the class, which is when they have to meet the requirements of getting a class action certified. In american law, the class action is a very powerful procedural tool that allows basically one law firm to bring the claims of numerous people, hundreds, thousands of people, in one case. And accordingly, the courts and the law don't just let anyone file a class action.
00:10:32.274 - 00:11:13.134, Speaker A: You have to show that there's a lot of people, that their claims are all the same, that they all have the same interests, and so on and so forth. So we did what we could do next, which was to oppose their class certification, and we prevailed. We beat them on class certification. They were only going to have maybe, like, six or seven plaintiffs, and the case just pretty much fell apart for them after that. And you could see it on the docket. It was called, I think the last version of it was called Otto versus Nano foundation or something like that. I just want to take a brief digression, Digashi, to say that anything that I'm saying on this podcast episode is strictly my opinion.
00:11:13.134 - 00:11:49.678, Speaker A: It's not the position or opinion of my clients or my law firm. So, anyway, that said, so we defended Nano. We beat the plaintiff's lawyers in several cases for them, and the whole process took between, I think, 2019 and mid 2021 we were wrapping up that one, and very little, if you looked at it from the outside, very little had happened in the case. They filed a complaint. There were two motions to dismiss and a motion for classer, but it took years. And that's just the way it is always.
00:11:49.844 - 00:12:02.878, Speaker B: You basically created your own law firm. And how does one do that? How do you go from working for someone and then deciding, I'm going to start my own law firm, and then kind of scaling and becoming bigger and bigger?
00:12:02.974 - 00:13:02.710, Speaker A: Well, once you have a law license, it's really easy to start your own law practice. The barriers to entry are very low. The biggest barrier to entry is confidence and risk taking. To start up a law firm, all you really need is a website, an email address, a malpractice policy, a phone number and accounting software. And like payments, the ability to accept payments, a bank account, you know, the confidence or the risk averseness of thinking that you're going to go out there and be able to get clients agree on what services you're going to provide to them, go out and provide the services, get paid, and not completely make a fool of yourself or get sued for malpractice. That's, I think, what is the real thing that it takes? I had helped, in my prior firm, the patent firm. I had helped the guy who established that firm start that firm from scratch.
00:13:03.050 - 00:13:04.790, Speaker B: Okay, so you already kind of had experience.
00:13:04.940 - 00:13:17.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd seen the inside. I knew kind of like all the different account subscriptions you needed, and I knew how to draft an engagement letter. I knew how to set up pretty much everything you needed to do, the website, whatever.
00:13:17.790 - 00:13:26.862, Speaker B: How do you discover clients and kind of keep them coming back? Well, obviously you do good work for them, but I guess finding the initial clients would be kind of tough, right?
00:13:26.916 - 00:14:08.486, Speaker A: It's not something like, I didn't take clients from my old firm. I didn't have anyone hanging around waiting for me to open my own law firm. So I just went out there, I started my firm, I opened up shop, and I started talking to everyone I knew, everyone I had worked with in the past, all my law school classmates, friends, relatives, anyone. And the work started to come in. And a lot of it initially was intellectual property work because everybody knew that I had worked at a patent firm. And so they were sending me stuff like copyright, trademark, patent type work. The copyright and trademark stuff I could really take up because it's pretty easy to do at a smaller firm.
00:14:08.486 - 00:14:56.522, Speaker A: Patent stuff is like, far more demanding from a resource perspective. So I wasn't really able to continue doing that so much. And then because of that, because of the copyright and trademark stuff, I just started to get into software related stuff on that basis. I also met a lawyer in Silicon Valley who, like me, had a small practice, but he was way more into it. Like, he'd been doing it for 25 years or something. And he had been a general counsel of technology companies. And him and I defended a brand that was owned by Oracle, an enterprise resources planning software company, in a number of litigations and a couple other companies too.
00:14:56.522 - 00:15:36.358, Speaker A: And so in the process of that, that was another couple of year process where we defended this company in a few different matters. And I learned a lot about how they develop software and how they sell software, how they modify software, enterprise software. And then you go out and meet people. Like, I was at consensus in New York City in 2018, and I just sat down at a table to take out my computer and check some email. And I started talking to someone. And he was working in business development at a company that spun off from a hedge fund. It was like an asset management platform.
00:15:36.358 - 00:15:52.406, Speaker A: This hedge fund had developed themselves and they thought it was a really good one, so they spun it off and they had just separated from the company, so they were looking for counsel. So I ended up meeting them through her, the chance encounter at a crypto conference. And they went on to be a great client for a long time.
00:15:52.448 - 00:15:58.030, Speaker B: So it's really like networking and word of mouth, putting yourself out there just with anything, really. Right?
00:15:58.100 - 00:16:04.402, Speaker A: Yeah. What really helps, too, is getting your name in the newspaper. And I did that quite a bit.
00:16:04.536 - 00:16:05.220, Speaker B: Yes.
00:16:06.390 - 00:16:08.510, Speaker A: Are you familiar with the Wutang clan?
00:16:08.590 - 00:16:09.266, Speaker B: I am.
00:16:09.368 - 00:16:51.486, Speaker A: Are you aware that they made a secret one copy album in like, 2014? I'm not. Well, so they did. And they used the artwork of this artist named Jason Koza in the book that came with the album. And it was famously sold to Martin Shrelli, this pharmaceutical hedge fund guy who had gotten into some trouble with the government. At this point, he hadn't gotten into trouble with the government yet, but he was notorious for raising the price of this AIDS drug by like 5000%. So he had a journalist over to look at the album, and the journalist took some pictures of the book and put them online. And Jason Koza found out that his images were used.
00:16:51.486 - 00:17:37.674, Speaker A: So he hired me and I sued Martin Shrelli and the people who produced the album for the Wutang clan for copyright infringement. That made the news that was in a bunch of papers. And later on, I ended up actually becoming friends with one of the guys that through my relationship with him, I just kind of stayed involved in the album and when the government seized it. So the US government arrested Martin Screlly for securities fraud. This is like 2019, I can't remember exactly what year. And they seized the album. And then I started working with some anonymous parties to buy the album from the government and sell it to Pleaserdao, the famous digital collective.
00:17:37.722 - 00:17:38.414, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:17:38.532 - 00:17:47.906, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. So that also made the papers, and that's good for business development and client generation, I would say. Yeah.
00:17:48.008 - 00:18:10.380, Speaker B: Quite interesting, I guess, to touch on intellectual property. From your perspective as a lawyer, how do companies keep their ip? Let's say they hire someone, right, and they're trying to build their brand or like a startup, but they have a really innovative idea and they don't want to leak it. But obviously there's always an intrinsic risk with hiring, I guess. How can you kind of prevent that as much as possible?
00:18:12.670 - 00:18:21.450, Speaker A: So the best way to prevent it is to give access to as few people as possible to what really is the most important ip.
00:18:21.790 - 00:18:22.394, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:22.512 - 00:19:00.326, Speaker A: But stepping back from that, you kind of have to assess what types of intellectual property is this company going to generate? What can we protect with copyright, trademark and trade secret protection or patent protection? And what can we not protect that way, and how do we minimize the risk of it being exploited somehow? I do that pretty frequently. I work with a lot of startups, and a lot of times they're trying to figure out, like, people usually jump to patent right away, can I patent this? And with software, a lot of times the answer is no, you got to copyright it or it's just a trade secret. And you have to really kind of minimize access to the code base and.
00:19:00.428 - 00:19:03.930, Speaker B: Whatever kind of modularize as much as possible.
00:19:04.080 - 00:19:19.534, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. I mean, the process of gaming out, what are we going to make and what type of ip is it, if anything, is the most important part? And then once you have that figured out, being flexible and responsive to how things change.
00:19:19.652 - 00:19:31.138, Speaker B: Right, got you. What about NDAs as well? Because you can write and sign an NDA. Right. But you don't know if they're breaking or not unless something leaks. Right?
00:19:31.224 - 00:20:02.058, Speaker A: Yeah. So stuff that's not copyrightable. So when you copyright something, the cat's out of the bag. You have to send a specimen to the Library of Congress so it's publicly available, you can't hide it. Same thing with patents when things are just proprietary. So you have like a secret list of clients or algorithms that you can't copyright and people have to use it for work. Yeah, you want to use nondisclosure agreements, proprietary information, ownership clauses and contracts, things like that.
00:20:02.058 - 00:20:56.910, Speaker A: And it's not a certainty that those promises will be honored by your employees. They might go work for a competitor and leak everything, and then you're just in a position of trying to minimize the damage that causes. Actually, one of the most interesting cases I ever worked on was at KL Gordon, where a bunch of executives from Starwood had been lured away to work at Hilton, and they stole entire hard drives of all the proprietary information. Yeah, like so much stuff that Starwood had developed all their terms with all the hotel owners, all their branding guidelines, plans for new hotels, like, everything. So we just had to sue Hilton and sue those executives and just try to claw it all back and reach a settlement. And it went pretty well for Star wars. We ended up, but that was just what it came down to.
00:20:56.980 - 00:21:07.250, Speaker B: So you have this whole Enterprise just stolen from the inside, and then, I guess, does the money even make up for the losses, though, you make when suing them?
00:21:07.320 - 00:21:46.462, Speaker A: It's hard to say. I mean, obviously we reached a resolution, and I think everyone walked away from it feeling like there was finality and there had been redress for the wrongs that were done. But the biggest risk of that case was that these executives who were in charge of the W brand were going to launch a competitor to the W hotel for Hilton that was called Denizen, and we put a stop to that. That would have been, like, the big loss, I think, for Starwood. So we stopped that dead in its tracks, and that was, I guess, like, the win for Starwood there.
00:21:46.516 - 00:21:52.574, Speaker B: There's always, like, loopholes as well. Like, they could just get a friend to open it up instead. Right? Or is that not really possible?
00:21:52.692 - 00:22:28.940, Speaker A: They wouldn't have been able to. But, I mean, with things like software and computer code, oftentimes it's kind of a lot harder to see what's happening. It's more hidden, so it's just difficult. The best thing you can possibly do if you're in the position of expending a lot of resources to develop intellectual property and code and stuff, is to give it to as few people as possible, really try to tie people's hands in terms of what they can do after they leave your company. You can't really use non compete. You can't stop someone from working at, say, like, another code audit company or whatever.
00:22:30.190 - 00:22:40.640, Speaker B: They can be, like, put themselves in another account, basically. Like in web free, at least just completely making you account work for someone else.
00:22:41.330 - 00:22:55.586, Speaker A: Pretty much, yeah. And then you're kind of limited to your ability to find that person and sue them and get a judgment against them, which is like, once you're in court, you basically already lost. That's the way I look at it.
00:22:55.688 - 00:23:06.998, Speaker B: Interesting. And what's the differential factor of winning a court case versus losing one? So how can you kind of set yourself up for kind of winning without leaking your alpha, of course?
00:23:07.084 - 00:23:31.022, Speaker A: No, there's no alpha. Really? There's no alpha. I mean, the way you can set yourself up to win is to just be cautious in your activities and your contracts with people. Make sure that if someone's accessing code or algorithms or just proprietary information, that's not public, that you know who's accessing it. It's only a few people. You have evidence that they're accessing it. When they're accessing it.
00:23:31.022 - 00:24:15.134, Speaker A: You have controls in place that show you if someone's downloading large files. You use all the kind of best practices and security, like cybersecurity protocols that you can use, and then you have a good contract, good contract terms in place, a clear contract, a contract that makes someone personally responsible, if possible. Like, you don't want people contracting with you through shell companies that have no assets. And you got to also kind of think about where people are. If someone is in a small country in Eastern Europe with not a greatly developed judicial system and you have to sue them there or you have to try to go enforce a judgment against them there, are you going to be able? Maybe not. Right.
00:24:15.252 - 00:24:24.610, Speaker B: I think, like, North Korea or Russia performing hacks, you can't really access the people doing the hacks. Kind of just like. It's stuck with it.
00:24:24.680 - 00:25:41.746, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a huge problem. Yeah, I've had that problem with my clients before, where one of my clients is a company that hosts very large conventions in Las Vegas and other cities around the world, and their members were getting these scam emails where every time there was an event that was going to happen, there were these companies that would try to sell them room block space at hotels or would try to sell them lists of event attendees that they could supposedly use for b two B marketing. And, yeah, they were committing trademark infringement because they were basically sending emails that seemed like they were coming from my client. And so it took me a really long time, but I eventually traced all these companies back to India and citizens of Bangalore and Calcutta. Or, you know, once we figured out that they were in India, we were kind of stopped in our tracks in terms of enforcing us trademark law because we're just not going to realistically go to India and hire a law firm and enforce a judgment against someone in India. It's just like, take a really long time. It would be really expensive, and it would probably not necessarily be that effective.
00:25:41.746 - 00:25:51.194, Speaker A: But there's a lot of countries around the world that people can operate out of that will not really lend themselves to enforcing us intellectual property laws, even.
00:25:51.232 - 00:26:19.720, Speaker B: With web free and blackouts as well. That might even become quite difficult if they're in one of these countries and they're anonymous. Well, I guess everyone's anonymous to some degree, but, yeah, I wonder how that whole process goes. Like, if someone were to do a blackout, let's say they're like a teenager coming out of high school or something, and they didn't really know anything to do with law or think they're immune, just do it, right? How does that kind of process happen? They just get tracked. And then what if they're on the.
00:26:20.090 - 00:27:09.110, Speaker A: Like in terms of civil law, I'm not aware of anyone ever successfully doing hackers and winning, especially if they're in another country. At best, us law enforcement, like the FBI maybe would do some kind of joint investigation and prosecution with the jurisdiction where that person's located. But the amount of times that happens is very limited by resources. And it's like only the biggest and most notorious cybercrimes usually are being addressed that way. There's just so much stuff that falls through the cracks because, yeah, people are offshore. If you can even find out where they are. And the means of the legal system to actually address that type of stuff for just regular companies are incredibly limited.
00:27:09.530 - 00:27:30.830, Speaker B: Right? Like someone could be using Tor and then tails, like a virtualbox VPN proxy, serve all that kind of stuff and kind of perform the hack. And it looks like you'll basically have to trace them somehow. Take ages, right? Unless they kind of expose themselves during the process in some way.
00:27:30.900 - 00:27:56.050, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you see it with ransomware, right? Like ransomware attackers, they're not stopped. They just get away with it forever. Once in a while they get arrested or whatever. If they do something really heinous, like encrypting all the files of a hospital where people are dying. But for the most part, I think that ransomware attackers just kind of operate with impunity. They don't really get caught.
00:27:56.050 - 00:27:58.342, Speaker A: And yeah, it's a big problem.
00:27:58.396 - 00:28:02.582, Speaker B: So they're ransomware attack operations. They're basically immune, right?
00:28:02.636 - 00:28:23.520, Speaker A: Yeah. They're difficult in the first place to detect and figure out where they're coming from and if you're just like a mid sized company that gets ransomed for a few hundred thousand dollars, you can go to law enforcement and tell them about it. They may or may not do something. And if you want to find the attackers and sue them in a civil case, you might as well just forget about it. It's not going to happen, probably.
00:28:23.890 - 00:28:52.280, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. So all these little small hacks on blockchain as well, like, let's say 20 grand, 50 grand, people aren't really noticing. I actually just follow this one guy that tweets about every hack and they're like these small ones or like ten grand or something. You can count them as like long tail mev. I guess it's hard to classify that as well, but then people don't even care. It's kind of funny in a way. Like these small.
00:28:53.370 - 00:29:03.980, Speaker A: I think the victims probably get very upset, but then quickly come to understand that. What are their options to make it right? Not good options.
00:29:06.350 - 00:29:30.082, Speaker B: The option to just try and trace them. I guess it's all dependent on the resources and how much is at stake. So I guess for someone that just lost ten grand through a contract, are you really going to try and investigate and try and find this person, spend all this resources hiring a law firm all this time just to find ten grand? And they're usually like, no, it's not really worth it. Right?
00:29:30.136 - 00:29:37.534, Speaker A: Yeah, you're not going to net anything. You'll end up spending five or six times that to even probably not figure out who the person was that hacked.
00:29:37.582 - 00:29:38.920, Speaker B: You'll just lose more.
00:29:39.850 - 00:29:47.000, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. It's called throwing good money after bad. It's like money you've lost and you're just going to lose more money trying to get back that money.
00:29:47.450 - 00:29:56.090, Speaker B: Yeah, it's quite interesting. So it really comes down to, is it worth pursuing? And I guess, how do you determine if it's worth pursuing?
00:29:56.510 - 00:30:27.682, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's just a dollar amount, right? I would say sometimes, probably like 10% of the time, the people who did the attack have made some mistake or left something behind that you could find to track them. But unless you're talking about millions of dollars, it's not going to be worth it. And even if you find them, what are the chances that they still have the funds or that you could get the funds back? Yeah, I don't know. You got to be really cautious of what protocols you use and what accounts you keep your funds on. For sure.
00:30:27.816 - 00:30:55.470, Speaker B: Yeah. So many security flaws. I mean, there's so many contracts out there. There's got to be at least like minimum 1% of all contracts out there got security flaws, and then you even see the big ones, like curve like that recently got exploited. You basically just got to look at the code to make sure you're not getting rugged in any way. But, I mean, that's horrible for retail users as well. They're not going to be able to just look at the code.
00:30:55.470 - 00:30:57.520, Speaker B: It's all up in the air for them.
00:30:58.610 - 00:31:13.666, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of the same with web two, though. Social media platform data leaks, payments platforms like cash app Zelle, whatever. I think people at this point are used to being rugged, like, one way or another.
00:31:13.848 - 00:31:14.938, Speaker B: They have a tolerance.
00:31:15.054 - 00:31:19.190, Speaker A: Yeah, but crypto does have a bit of a worse reputation for that. And defi.
00:31:19.930 - 00:31:23.720, Speaker B: Yeah, when you think of crypto, it's just nfts and rugs, basically.
00:31:25.450 - 00:31:26.802, Speaker A: And pump and dump.
00:31:26.946 - 00:31:43.262, Speaker B: Exactly. But I mean, they always have some trace at the end. Right. I guess if they're not doing OTC or I guess like a tornado cash thing, then they're always going to have some kind of trace with extracting the money into fiat, you'd think.
00:31:43.316 - 00:32:03.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it did kind of surprise me initially that there were so many rugs in crypto and people couldn't trace the assets somewhere because blockchain and distributed ledgers are obviously set up to create, like, a huge trail of where the money goes. But I guess that the promise of that feature of the technology hasn't really kept up with people's ability to get around it.
00:32:03.976 - 00:32:23.738, Speaker B: Yeah. Since it's always there, maybe people in the future, once the technology has kind of established itself a bit more people go back and check all the hacks and finally get these people. It should be quite interesting with, like, ZK as well, though, because then you also have anonymous hacks at that point. And then how do you know where my money is going?
00:32:23.824 - 00:32:32.858, Speaker A: Yeah, ZK is pretty interesting. It's like kind of another fascinating evolution of blockchain, web three technology. Who knows how it'll play out eventually.
00:32:32.954 - 00:32:48.670, Speaker B: Regarding the law firm, how do you kind of run a successful one, even if you take a loss in court? Right. How do you bounce back? Does that kind of ruin your reputation a whole bunch? Yeah, I guess. How do you become successful, quote unquote?
00:32:48.750 - 00:33:39.780, Speaker A: Well, a loss in court, I think it depends on what the loss resulted from, because when you're in court, you're dealing with a third party that makes decisions that you don't have any control over. So you can do your best, you can read all the cases and cite all the right case law and do your best and still end up with an irrational decision by the judge or a jury or whatever. So that's tough. If you've done something really stupid like miss an important case or fail to depose a witness who has critical information, then you kind of deserve to have a bad reputation, honestly. But if the loss is because of circumstances beyond your control, then it's not necessarily looked upon badly. But in litigation, it's just important to be thorough. Have a thorough investigation of the facts of the case.
00:33:39.780 - 00:34:39.826, Speaker A: Make sure that you're talking to all the right people. Make sure that you really understand the legal issues and all the case law that bears on them and all the regulations, and make sure that you keep an eye on the deadlines and you're not caught and having to scramble to file something hastily that's not done the right way. And you should be as successful as anyone can be if you do those things. We also do a lot of transactions, so cap raises, setting up entities, setting up offshore structures, commercial contract contracts with vendors, asset purchases. And to be successful in those things, it kind of comes down to giving the clients what they need with a high quality and not dragging transactions out and making people lose deals because you're like over negotiating points or being unreasonable with that stuff. It's not that important. So, yeah, that covers the litigation and transaction sides.
00:34:40.018 - 00:34:54.282, Speaker B: Got you. And I guess, how do you separate yourself from another lawyer and make be better than them in some way, like the average lawyer? I guess, how do you stand out from that?
00:34:54.336 - 00:36:03.514, Speaker A: I mean, to some extent, I guess it's kind of being on top of the industries that you're serving. So, for example, with all the technology stuff that I work on, from a legal perspective, I also have a lot of interaction with the day to day operations in a lot of those companies because I'm sometimes working in management or I'm even a principal or an owner of some of the companies, like the software development companies. So I understand very well how these companies come about, how they kind of get up to speed, how they operate, how they sell things, how they buy things, whatever, and how they hire people, how they develop technology, how they plan out the engineering process, all that kind of stuff. And then in terms of the legal stuff, like how to negotiate different types of deals, that kind of comes more with experience. There's nothing you can really do, just like sitting there on off hours to get better at it. You kind of just have to have a lot of experiences negotiating contracts and counseling clients on what they should and shouldn't do in different transactional contexts.
00:36:03.642 - 00:36:28.440, Speaker B: The side of someone getting hired and they've been given a contract, how do you determine that this contract is fair and it's not going to screw you over long term? Because personally, I have been screwed over. I've lost like 60 grand that was meant to be owed, but obviously didn't get it, I guess. How can you kind of avoid that?
00:36:29.290 - 00:37:29.740, Speaker A: That's a good question. You want to definitely read closely the contract to make sure that it actually includes what you've agreed in a conversation with the person who's hiring you. If they promised you certain amount of money or some other things that are not in the contract, then you got to make sure it's in the contract. You also want to make sure that you're not necessarily getting paid the entire amount of the contract after all the work is done. Like, it's smart to get paid something up front, something kind of like halfway through, and then something less than 50% of what's owed. So maybe you want to get paid like 70% through the halfway mark of the milestones you've agreed on, and then just get paid 25% at the end, because that way you kind of minimize the amount of money that someone can just not pay you once you've given them the work product. Also in the contract, if possible, you want to have the intellectual property or work product ownership hinge upon full payment for the work.
00:37:29.740 - 00:39:14.478, Speaker A: And again, this kind of goes back to, can you enforce this contract? Can you actually stop the buyer of this work product from you, from using it? Or can you call it back from them somehow if they don't pay you? But you do your best and you put what you can in the contract to protect yourself from not getting paid the full amount or from being able to give yourself the ability to take back the work product somehow, or claim that they don't have rightful ownership to it and stop them from using it if they don't pay you the full amount? Also super important to have really clear standards on what is actually supposed to be delivered. What are the deliverables? What are you warranting and representing? Are you saying that this software is just going to work? You don't want to do that, then it's pretty easy for someone to say, oh, it doesn't work. So you want to have some kind of objective statement in the contract of how is it supposed to work? And in other disputes I've been involved in, what really saved the client was having a warranty that said, that this software that we're developing for you is going to work according to the user manuals that we publish from time to time. And the user manuals would say things like, this enterprise resources planning platform will store data and present a dashboard to the user so the user can see how many hours people are working, whatever, stuff like that. Right. It's not like this is going to be the solution to all your problems or this is going to make your business work well, because if you don't have definite language around how the software is supposed to work, then you're leaving yourself open to the client at the end of the engagement saying, well, it just doesn't work, so I'm not going to pay you. And it probably does work.
00:39:14.478 - 00:39:27.762, Speaker A: Right. And they're just being greedy and selfish. Maybe not, though, but you want to at least agree with them on what are you actually giving them and how is it supposed to work. That's very important.
00:39:27.896 - 00:39:41.080, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess if they don't pay you at the end, the whole kind of strategy is get as much as you can early on or kind of throughout the thing before you give them the result. Right?
00:39:41.770 - 00:40:06.682, Speaker A: Yeah. You want to get paid substantially before you deliver the final work product. It's tough because you could misuse that too. Right? You could say like, all right, I want 50% up front, and then you just don't do any work. Walk away. Right. You could rug them too, in the context of being the person who's selling the services and being engaged.
00:40:06.682 - 00:40:41.618, Speaker A: That's how to protect yourself is to get paid based on milestones, get paid somewhat upfront. You could also try to use an escrow. You could try to use like a third party that would hold the money in kind of a neutral fashion. And they get a message from the buyer that says, okay, the software has been delivered, now you can release the money, and if the buyer of the software or the services is unreasonable about it, then they don't have the money. The escrow agent has the money, so they're not going to get it back either. Right. You're going to have to just go to court and fight over it.
00:40:41.618 - 00:40:52.960, Speaker A: So that kind of changes the leverage and the dynamics a little bit. But I'm not aware of any escrows that are just out there waiting to do that. But find one probably if the contract is big enough.
00:40:53.410 - 00:41:36.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I imagine. Well, in my case, since I didn't get paid, I had no law experience. I was pretty young, 19, and I did this job for, I think it was like 160k, but then the end of it didn't get paid. Like the was like, oh, well, shit, what do I do? Because I had no experience in the law. I'm like, okay, well, I just got rugged cool onto the next, I guess. I guess. What do people do at that point? If there's, like, a certain amount of money and they do get rugged? I guess there's not really many options, unless you think it's worth pursuing or it's just an expensive lesson, really.
00:41:36.720 - 00:42:15.046, Speaker A: I mean, I've certainly had a lot of people come to me with situations that sound exactly like that and dollar amounts that are pretty similar. And usually we'll give it a try. We'll go to the person that owes the money and say, hey up, this is outrageous. What are you thinking? And sometimes they'll pay up. Sometimes they're just trying to negotiate a discount. But another thing you can do in your contract that's important is put a provision in there that requires them to pay the attorneys fees if you have to sue them and they lose, because that then puts the risk of loss kind of more on them. It changes the leverage dynamics quite a bit.
00:42:15.046 - 00:42:23.530, Speaker A: So if you got to go see them to collect, they have to pay for that too. And then they think twice about refusing to pay you unreasonably.
00:42:24.030 - 00:42:41.038, Speaker B: Yeah, it kind of disincentivizes them to do the rug, because if they know they're in the wrong and they get confronted, they're like, oh, well, shit, maybe this isn't really worth in the long run, so that definitely makes sense, but.
00:42:41.204 - 00:42:41.726, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:42:41.828 - 00:42:50.434, Speaker B: I guess with things like startups, instead of salaries, you have co founders, right? Then you have equity. So I guess how do you deal with that as well?
00:42:50.632 - 00:42:53.922, Speaker A: What do you mean by how do you deal with that? How do you deal with what in particular?
00:42:54.056 - 00:43:18.554, Speaker B: There's no payments. Right. And we just talked about the salary thing. You can kind of learn all this, prevent all the rugging and salaries, but then in equity with co founders, people might get greedy or grab the code, start their own thing or just like anything. And I guess if it starts making money, how do people uphold what?
00:43:18.592 - 00:44:32.430, Speaker A: The deal, basically. So how do you stop founders? Like, if you're a minority owner of the company or you don't have control of the assets of the company, how do you stop founders from screwing you over? Yeah, that's a good question. So first and foremost, you want to try to do business with people that you trust who seem like moral people, if you can. That's always, like, the first place to start, because all the contracts and stuff in the world aren't going to necessarily completely solve the problem the way you'd want them to. That being said, some things you can do outside of just working with people that you trust, are to make sure that everything that's being generated by the company, all the software, the intellectual property, the assets, are all owned by the company that you own equity in, that you're getting equity in. So you don't want to get like, shares in a corporation that's a holding company, and there's a subsidiary that has all the IP or all the assets, and only, like, minority owned by the holding company. You want to make sure that the ownership of the company and its business and its operations and its assets are in the same entity that you're going to get equity in, first and foremost.
00:44:32.430 - 00:45:16.894, Speaker A: Right. And if they're not, there might be a good reason for that, but you want to be satisfied that it's not like a nefarious reason, that they're not just doing it to give you illusory equity ownership. Second, you want to definitely get all your equity ownership documents and employment contracts hammered out and signed by you and the company before you start doing anything, if possible. Because so many times in founder disputes, I've seen people who were kind of like working informally. The founder would say, oh, yeah, I'm going to give you 5% to do this design work, or I'm going to give you 5% to do this engineering. And then the number changes. It's like, oh, I can give you 4%, or I'm actually going to give you 15%.
00:45:16.894 - 00:45:53.646, Speaker A: You're doing a great job, but it's all just in like dms or whatever. That's not very helpful when you have to sue them later. So you want to get the equity grants, like the stock options or rsus or whatever it is actually granted to you. You want to make sure that they're being granted properly by the company so that the board has actually resolved the issue. The equity. You want to make sure that whatever employment contract you have reflects your real agreement and that it shows what equity you're supposed to have. Usually there's multiple documents involved, like there'd be an employment contract and then some kind of an options award or whatever.
00:45:53.646 - 00:46:24.726, Speaker A: Sometimes they're all in one document. Sometimes it's less formal, but under the circumstances, you want to do the best you can to get as much paper as possible. You also critically want to make sure that the name of the company is on there. It's like the right company. It's the company that you're working for. It's the company that owns the assets and that the person who's signing it is authorized to sign it. Because a lot of times people might not properly be the agent of the company who can actually bind the company.
00:46:24.726 - 00:46:30.390, Speaker A: So it should be a pretty high level executive or director or whatever who can actually bind the company.
00:46:30.460 - 00:46:33.194, Speaker B: How do you know if it is the executive or someone higher up?
00:46:33.232 - 00:47:09.480, Speaker A: It kind of depends on the circumstances. Sometimes you can get companies to show you their resolutions and their organizational documents, like their bylaws or whatever, that appoint officers and delegate people with certain authority. But I mean, if the stakes are high, you should just go find a lawyer, because it's not that hard stuff. But if you're just trying to do it yourself. Yeah, ask for the organizational documents and just do your diligence. Like spend some time looking at stuff, thinking about it, asking questions, making sure you're getting solid answers, that type of thing.
00:47:10.170 - 00:47:41.358, Speaker B: And I guess what happens if kind of they move stuff around, like the intellectual property into, I guess, like a different kind of account. And how do you find all the relevant information? I guess like revenue streams or ownership of things, I guess. What if two of the co founders kind of gang up on a single co founder and increase their share versus them? How do you kind of go about that stuff?
00:47:41.444 - 00:48:38.146, Speaker A: Well, it starts before you have the contract, right? You want to ask questions. You want to say, like, okay, let me see your resolutions. I want to see who owns this company, who set it up, what's the ownership, what does the cap table say? Who owns what, who's the majority owner, who are the investors? You may not necessarily get all this stuff. It's not like if you're kind of like a relatively smaller player in the picture, you're going to get all this stuff, but this is how you would actually do it, right? You find out what the ownership structure is, find out what the organizational documents say, find out what are the operations and assets of this company, where are they found? Whatever. Make sure that the company is not entitled to just sell assets without a majority of the company voting for it or whatever. You want to get informational rights, if you can, in your contract. So, like rights to look at the books and records or rights to know when certain material transactions are going to happen.
00:48:38.146 - 00:49:24.994, Speaker A: If you have a lot of leverage, sometimes you can get a veto right on certain things, but that's kind of rare. Yeah, that would be it. And just kind of like keep your ear to the rail, talk to people in the industry. Maybe you'll hear through the grapevine that there's some transactions going to happen that you weren't told about, and then you got to ask management about it and see if figure out if you have the right to stop it or how it's going to impact you, but doing the best you can. Often people just end up getting screwed anyway, and a lot of technology founders are just unscrupulous, and they just take advantage of people and do wrong by people, and then you're just stuck having to sue them. So you do the best you can and cross your fingers and hope you don't have to sue someone.
00:49:25.192 - 00:49:49.558, Speaker B: Yeah, it seems like it's all just like a trust game with all these contracts and whatnot. I guess it doesn't prevent it kind of mitigates in some ways, but the ultimate kind of resolution is trust the people you're dealing with. Make sure they're people you want to be dealing with. Yeah, I think that's kind of like the main kind of mitigation technique, right?
00:49:49.644 - 00:50:23.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, try to look them up, see if they've been involved in litigation before. A lot of people who are starting tech startups are pretty young, so they might not have actually done anything that you could find out about before, but look out for red flags, look out for promises that sound too good to be true. And if they're kind of like misleading investors to begin with and you know about that, you got to question their moral compass. Try to spend some time with them in person if you can, IRL build the rapport.
00:50:25.830 - 00:50:43.702, Speaker B: And I guess as a tech startup founder as well, what kind of contracts or things you should put in place to kind of keep yourself protected, but also make sure that the people you're hiring are also satisfied.
00:50:43.846 - 00:51:39.878, Speaker A: It's kind of the same principles. Keeping the people that you're hiring satisfied means having expectations set the right way and delivering what you promise to them, giving them as much visibility into the company as you can without giving them visibility into stuff that they don't need to know and can't change, but will make them upset. Definitely the same as with what I said before, kind of like doing diligence on them, getting to know them a little bit. I would say that it's really important to me to work with people on kind of an informal basis for some initial short period of time to see what they're like. Because if you just hire someone off a website without ever talking to them and working with them, you might quickly find out that they're just impossible to work with and you don't get along with them. Try to do like one or two projects on a project basis before you commit to hiring someone and working with them for the long term.
00:51:40.054 - 00:51:48.206, Speaker B: Right. So just kind of have them on trial, period informally, and see how the relationship goes and all that stuff.
00:51:48.388 - 00:52:28.300, Speaker A: And then for startup founders, for investors also, it's really important to know who your investors are very well, know kind of what their expectations are just on a baseline and then set their expectations reasonably. Don't do business with people who are abrasive or unreasonably demanding or predatory, and they really just kind of want to exploit you. Try to have some kind of really clear understanding in place of what you're going to do with the investment funds and what the progression of the company is going to be, the business idea and that type of thing.
00:52:29.390 - 00:52:55.940, Speaker B: When you're starting a startup as well and you have no money to basically hire a lawyer, what are kind of like the steps someone should take to, I guess initialize the startup and with the contracts and all that kind of things to make sure they're safe until they get the money right. Maybe they raise really early and then they kind of all these problems. So how would you go about dealing with the early stages with no money?
00:52:56.950 - 00:53:33.550, Speaker A: I mean, if you have no budget for legal, I would try to keep things as simple as possible. So just start a limited company or a limited liability company. Those are really straightforward to operate and very inexpensive to set up. Keep all your accounts for the company separate from your own personal accounts. So don't use your payment platforms and bank accounts and your personal name to pay for business expenses. And then in terms of contracts, I guess go on like legal Zoom or rocket lawyer and try to find the appropriate templates for employees and customers because that's probably all you're going to have. If you don't have the budget for legal, you're not going to have investors.
00:53:33.550 - 00:53:51.542, Speaker A: You just got to make sure that people that you're doing business with, either people you're hiring to do work for you or people that you're selling stuff to, that you have some kind of contract in place that's appropriate under the circumstances that they've signed and that you've signed and that you can find a copy of in case things go bad.
00:53:51.596 - 00:54:02.378, Speaker B: Yeah, and I guess also international as well. If you're in one country and you're hiring from another country, is it kind of the same process or is there some extra steps to take?
00:54:02.464 - 00:54:44.886, Speaker A: Yeah, there's immigration laws and there's also potentially that tax implications. So if you're in the US, maybe you can hire an engineering company to design some software, develop some code for you on a project basis. But if you're just hiring someone to work for you on a freelance basis, but they work for you 40 hours a week, you might be violating the labor law in their country where they're based. Like say for example, if they're in Brazil, you're supposed to be paying all sorts of different amounts of money to the brazilian government for their pension, health care and stuff like that.
00:54:45.068 - 00:54:45.702, Speaker B: Right.
00:54:45.836 - 00:54:46.182, Speaker A: Okay.
00:54:46.236 - 00:54:48.338, Speaker B: That seems kind of a complex.
00:54:48.514 - 00:55:05.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty complex. It's difficult to hire people internationally without having legal in place to kind of guide you through the right stuff. And in some cases, if you're going to hire offshore, you have to actually set up a whole company offshore that the employees work. I mean it's not that straightforward.
00:55:05.754 - 00:55:39.750, Speaker B: Yeah, because I can imagine someone is in the US and they're hiring overseas and let's say like Australia or Asia or Middle east, then you have to deal with all those because everybody's basically work remotely now. So yeah, it sounds like a headache. Or even contracts. Can you kind of just say, okay, all the laws are based in the US and you have to adhere to this, but how are you going to enforce that? I guess. And how do you know that what their name they put down is correct? Especially in crypto? Right, like you just do anonymous?
00:55:41.290 - 00:56:06.340, Speaker A: I mean it's difficult in crypto in general. People who are overseas or who you're not dealing with face to, like you have no idea who they are. Really. You might try to get some identification documents like a passport or KYC type stuff to confirm who they are. Try to put jurisdiction clause in the contract. That makes sense. Maybe it's the US, maybe it's the country that they're based in, maybe it's some other country.
00:56:06.340 - 00:56:22.040, Speaker A: But the best way to deal with disputes that arise between people in different countries, I found, is to use arbitration, like international arbitration, which is like a private court. There are a few different companies around the world that.
00:56:22.810 - 00:56:23.910, Speaker B: Like a middleman.
00:56:24.970 - 00:56:57.620, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like a court that you go to that you use by contract. It's like a private company that resolves disputes for you and those decisions are binding on you. So if someone tries to say I don't like the way that came out, they can't just get away from it like they've agreed to it and it will be enforced in a court somewhere against them. I was going to say, I've used the International center for Dispute Resolution quite a bit, which the American Arbitration association owns, but they have, like, multilingual administrators and stuff and makes it a bit easier to find the right person.
00:56:58.470 - 00:57:14.600, Speaker B: I guess it's also good to consider where they're based and I guess the relationship between your home country and their country as well. Let's say they're in Russia. You don't want to, probably not want to hire someone in Russia when you're in a uS.
00:57:17.050 - 00:58:00.562, Speaker A: I mean, it's going to be challenging. First of all, you got to consider whether you're violating sanctions. If. If they're part of some organization that's on a sanctions list, you might get trouble for paying them to do work for you. And, yeah, if you have some kind of legal dispute, you got to think about, how am I going to enforce this contract? A court in Russia might just not care about it. I had that problem once where one of my clients has a famous brand, and some people in Iran set up a domain that used their trademark but was like a new top level domain. So they just kind of got in there and registered this domain name, and they were using it to sell stuff that was pretty similar to what my client was selling.
00:58:00.562 - 00:58:57.862, Speaker A: So we went to the World Intellectual Property Organization and initiated a uniform dispute resolution proceeding, a UDRP, which is like the cyber squatting, like the universal cyber squatting thing, where you kind of go and say, like, they've registered this domain name wrongly, they shouldn't be allowed to have it. So we won at the World Intellectual Property organization. But then Iran's treaty, when Iran signed the treaty for the World Intellectual Property Organization, they had a caveat in there that basically if anyone who was based in Iran lost a cyber squatting case, they could appeal it in Sharia court. In know, the people who lost, who owned this domain did that. They filed appeal in Sharia court. And at that point, I was like all like, I think that our options are very limited to hire a law firm in Iran and go in there and try to fight them in sharia court. So that was pretty much the end of the game for them.
00:58:57.996 - 00:59:07.834, Speaker B: Interesting. And what if someone falsely sues you or just summons you to court? I guess. What are your kind of options there?
00:59:07.952 - 00:59:32.706, Speaker A: It kind of depends on the context, but usually cases that are wrongly filed that just have no. If someone who you've never had any kind of interaction with just sues you, first of all, it's pretty rare. But second of all, you should be able to go into court and get it dismissed relatively inexpensively. You should hire a lawyer. You don't want to just be kind of like dealing with it yourself. And if it's a company that you own, usually you can't represent it yourself. But yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.
00:59:32.706 - 00:59:50.346, Speaker A: It's more of a problem when you're doing business with someone and they file a lawsuit that really has no basis, but they're just doing it out of spite or they're trying to overreach you, then those things usually kind of like drag out much longer and are more of a headache, which is why it's important to have good contracts in place, is what we do business with.
00:59:50.448 - 01:00:13.870, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. And I guess it's becoming even more prevalent with deep fake and I guess you can even, I guess, images of Photoshop, of screenshots, of messages, you could forge someone's name in a social media platform and kind of do that. So I guess that's when it gets very bad for the person on the receiving end.
01:00:13.940 - 01:00:24.260, Speaker A: Yeah, I haven't seen anything like that come up, but I could imagine it would be pretty difficult to deal with and maybe could confuse the court quite a bit and make it more expensive to get rid of.
01:00:24.870 - 01:00:45.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think deepfakes are going to be a massive thing in the future of just falsely accused things. We've already seen it with deep fake adult films of people and politicians, and people use it for advertising as well. It's crazy. So it's kind of scary as well.
01:00:45.280 - 01:00:55.760, Speaker A: I can't lie. I have questioned things that I've seen on social media or whatever as being deep fake before. So, yeah, it's already starting to erode our trust in what we're seeing.
01:00:56.530 - 01:01:07.098, Speaker B: And especially since the whole system is trust based as well, and subjective, it can be quite scary if you're on the receiving end of it.
01:01:07.204 - 01:01:08.050, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%.
01:01:08.120 - 01:01:14.270, Speaker B: So I guess at that point, especially, you have no money, you're kind of screwed, right? Or just kind of taken on the chin?
01:01:14.350 - 01:01:21.558, Speaker A: It depends on the circumstances. I mean, maybe, but I'm sure that that type of thing is going to come up more frequently in the future, so should be fun.
01:01:21.644 - 01:01:33.274, Speaker B: Well, it has been like an hour and a bit. I would like to thank you for coming on. I really appreciate this. You've taught me a lot about law. I don't know anything about it, but now I have. Yeah, it's been a pleasure, man. Thank you so much for coming on.
01:01:33.274 - 01:01:43.902, Speaker B: And hopefully people have learned some stuff about law and setting up startups and contracting all that stuff if someone wants to get in contact with you, how can they do that?
01:01:43.956 - 01:02:02.882, Speaker A: I'm pretty easy to find online. My law firm website is sprfllp.com. And just look up my name. I'm usually the first that pops up. My email address is on there, so anyone who wants can just reach out to me and I'll try to get back to you right away. Thanks a lot for having me. It's been a pleasure speaking with you.
01:02:02.882 - 01:02:25.158, Speaker A: And I just want to say that nothing that I've said in this interview has been legal advice to anyone. It's important that if someone has a specific legal issue, that they should find a lawyer and explain that issue to them and then get specific advice in that regard. But yeah, thanks for your time and it's been a pleasure and I hope that this is informative to people.
01:02:25.244 - 01:02:44.186, Speaker B: Yeah, likewise. It's been informative for me, definitely. And if anyone wants to have have someone come on the show, just dm me on Twitter at scrapingbits or email me at scrapingbits@gmail.com. But otherwise, thank you so much, Peter, for coming on, and I'll see y'all in the next episode.
01:02:44.298 - 01:02:45.500, Speaker A: Thank you to Gachi. Take care.
