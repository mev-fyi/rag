00:00:00.570 - 00:00:14.350, Speaker A: Millions, like tens of millions every month on volume. We were like three, four persons, and we didn't have even a company for this. You know, I was threatened multiple times. Come and kill me. I bought a gun and bulletproof vest. You're welcome to come. I'm waiting.
00:00:15.650 - 00:00:22.894, Speaker B: GMGM, everyone. My name is Degachi, the host of scraping bits, and today I'm with Sergey from one inch. How's it going, friend?
00:00:23.092 - 00:00:25.814, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. All good, all good.
00:00:25.932 - 00:00:29.302, Speaker B: Just for the people that don't really know about you, who are you and what do you do?
00:00:29.356 - 00:00:58.720, Speaker A: So my name is Sergey Kunz. I'm software engineer, software architect for 18 years, and also security expert. I'm co founder of one each network. So I'm my co founder, Anton Bookoff. He came to an idea how to improve the space by aggregating among distro's liquidity sources in one single transaction and introduce aggregation into these different markets. Yeah. Nowadays, working hard with all other 150 core contributors around the globe on one each network and to improve the web three space and user experience.
00:00:59.170 - 00:01:07.140, Speaker B: Very exciting. And it's super interesting how you got into basically one inch. It all started at a hackathon, right?
00:01:07.910 - 00:01:18.840, Speaker A: Yes. So back in 2018, I met Michael van Ranton in person. So we were like, chatting a little bit over like eight months. We were on YouTube together.
00:01:20.170 - 00:01:21.142, Speaker B: How did you meet him?
00:01:21.196 - 00:02:03.746, Speaker A: So actually, I met one of his friends who came with his wife to Germany and his wife, the friend's wife was in contact with my ex wife nowadays. Yeah. And somehow I met him through my ex wife, this guy with his wife. And I tried to speak with them about crypto because I was already mining, like, built my own rigs in Germany and just played around with that. And they said he's not interested at all in crypto, but he has a friend who is always speaking about crypto, like me. And he introduced me to Anton, like early 2018. It was, I guess, like March or something 2018.
00:02:03.746 - 00:02:51.170, Speaker A: And I had actually almost no contact with Anton a little bit. And then one day I started to do YouTube. I had my YouTube channel, cryptomaniac, and I was speaking about mining. I tried to improve my skills in presenting something, and I started to do security audits. I tried to explain people, they shouldn't invest in positive schemes because they will lose money and try to explain, this is a program, a smart contract, and someone can build into the smart contract, the backdoor, and steal all the money and everything. And Anton joined a live stream. He asked to join because he was already experienced.
00:02:51.170 - 00:03:26.240, Speaker A: And after that first live stream. I would say we just tried to explain until how smart contracts works because I was not experienced in smart contracts. I was like, I guess like 1415 years of software engineer experience I had, but like almost nothing in smart contracts. And Anton was already experienced. He did already multiple hackathons and so on. And after that, we spent half of a year on YouTube. We were streaming up to 8 hours a day or mostly in the night.
00:03:26.240 - 00:03:50.454, Speaker A: And this little bit. Yeah, there were a lot of Ponzi schemes on smart contracts. We tried to fight against them by explaining people that they shouldn't invest in them. I was threatened multiple times, come and kill me. So I bought a gun. I bought a gun and the bulletproof vest went out online for the live stream. Said, like, guys, you're welcome to come.
00:03:50.454 - 00:04:28.146, Speaker A: I'm waiting. It was kind of crazy situation also, but kind of show for the people. They were really happy to see us. And a lot of people learned also writing smart contracts based on our audit videos because we explained what they should look for if they write something, we explain the functionality behind all the metals implemented smart contracts, which we have audited. End of 2018. Anton offered me to go to the hackathon. I was never on a hackathon, so I didn't participate in one.
00:04:28.146 - 00:04:50.838, Speaker A: And I joined them. We met in Singapore. I met osvitalik. It was eth Singapore. I met a lot of other people. And that experience enough that we can just build something overnight and we can win know. We won three prizes, one from Makerdao, one from Kyber, and one from set protocol.
00:04:50.838 - 00:05:28.418, Speaker A: And it was like, we can do it every month. So we started to travel around the globe. I was almost everywhere, in Bangalore, in India, in South Africa, New York, Boston, Denver, the whole globe, really. And one of the secretars, we have built one inch in New York. So normally the process is like, we come to the hackathon, we try to fill it, what we should build. So we speak with a lot of people in New York. I spoke with Vitali Guterin, I spoke with Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap.
00:05:28.418 - 00:06:01.946, Speaker A: And we came to the idea why the hell no one is aggregating these exchanges. Adele suggested to build one single page where you can choose one of the liquid sources and then you can exchange on them. And I told them, that makes no sense. It's not efficient. It makes maybe sense to write an algorithm which make us distribution among liquidity sources based on the rates. So I'm actually very bad in algorithms nowadays. I try to improve my skills, but back into the days and I have also no degrees.
00:06:01.946 - 00:06:21.334, Speaker A: I have no bachelor master degrees or something like that. I'm just software engineer. I learned software engineering in Germany and worked just very hard in different startups and enterprise companies as well. And I told Anton to write one. I had just the gut feeling that this is the right way. And he recognized, yeah, that could work. But he was not sure.
00:06:21.334 - 00:06:47.040, Speaker A: He went like for 3 hours offline. He was remotely from Moscow, and nowadays he's in Amsterdam living. But into the early days he was in Moscow, and he came back with algorithm. I integrated this algorithm in the DMP in the web three app, and it worked. And I pitched to everyone there on the hackathon. Almost no one understood it. One guy said, this is the next big thing.
00:06:47.040 - 00:07:17.574, Speaker A: The organizer, Liam Horn, he said like, whoa, I need to sit, I need this. He told, like, I need this. I swapped and I got really bad weather. I need to look at the liquidity, because back in the days, the liquidity was not that distributed like it's nowadays. So we have right now on Ethereum, 30,000 liquidity Sources if you swap on one inch. And back in the days it was less. Yeah.
00:07:17.574 - 00:07:22.170, Speaker A: But anyway, it was pain to go to the DAX and look and everything.
00:07:22.240 - 00:07:27.820, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, man. Doing manual exchange rates and trying to find the best one all the time.
00:07:28.590 - 00:08:16.134, Speaker A: We solved this. We introduced aggregation market to everyone, and people start to share the link to the D app, which we have built over the hackathon. So on the hackathon, I didn't sleep 56 hours. It was crazy. We had really nice idea, but I understood that I need to give everything because we need to deliver it at the end of the hackathon to maybe get the main price and get some traction. But we didn't win anything except small price from ENS, $300, which I used to pay my airplane ticket back to Germany two weeks after the hackathon. Normally we don't continue work after the hackathon on the projects.
00:08:16.134 - 00:08:49.446, Speaker A: We have built also like video streaming platform by using WebRTC and payment channels so people can actually stream and someone who consumed, they pay for each. Yeah. We didn't continue work on such projects, but two weeks later, something Anton called me and told me this volume. And at first I didn't understand what he's talking about. And he said, we have one smart contract of one inch. We have volume. It's like tens of thousands of dollars.
00:08:49.446 - 00:09:14.190, Speaker A: It became then a week later, hundreds of thousands of dollars volume. Like people exchange, people start using after a hackathon. Yeah. And we created Twitter account and this time I was living in the office. So my ex wife decided to leave me and told me I should move out of home flat. So I had no other options to live in my dirty office where I had my mining farm.
00:09:15.010 - 00:09:17.498, Speaker B: The mining farm. The good old mining farm.
00:09:17.594 - 00:09:28.686, Speaker A: Yeah. Was sleeping on the air mattress and had my daughter every three, four days for three, four days. And she still remembered asking, did we really live in the office with no shower?
00:09:28.798 - 00:09:30.306, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Yeah.
00:09:30.488 - 00:09:59.754, Speaker A: But it's a nice experience. I understood what means freedom. I was free in traveling, I was free in building. And I used this time to work on one h first, like in the night, because day over I had job at Porsche. So I was working for Porsche as a DevOps engineer and security expert. Then later and day over, I had no time for this. Anton as well.
00:09:59.754 - 00:10:32.038, Speaker A: He was working for near building the rainbow bridge. And in the night we were hacking together. It was fun. It's like hobby, and it was not profit driven at all. So we were working with two and half men like I, Anton, and our friend Michelle, who helped us a little bit with this algorithm. We were working one half years without raising any funds or something. From May 2019 to early 2020, we spent just on free time by building something what was highly used.
00:10:32.124 - 00:10:45.002, Speaker B: And how did you start to expand after this hackathon? Did you start to hire at all? Did you spend any money on marketing, et cetera? How did you really scale from there?
00:10:45.056 - 00:11:12.578, Speaker A: Yeah, we had no money. I personally had no money, except a little bit for the hackathons, but we won something on the hackathons, so I got my money back. So it wasn't successful investments, kind of, but we had no money. Also similar to Anton, he has family with wife and two kids, and also didn't earn a lot on near. Also in like as a senior software engineer, you get really small amount of money.
00:11:12.744 - 00:11:14.180, Speaker B: The taxes as well.
00:11:14.790 - 00:11:43.678, Speaker A: Yeah, taxes. Half you pay taxes. This is the real life you're living from month to month and try to save a little bit money, but you cannot really. I had to pay to my ex wife. I had to pay for the apartment where she was living for my daughter. I had to pay and also had to organize money when she's with me. I also spent money for her and for clothes and whatever else.
00:11:43.678 - 00:12:18.310, Speaker A: So we had no money. So what you do when you have no money, you became highly creative. We started to use memes. Anton likes memes. He's like a pro in creating memes. And we leverage our connection to all people every time when we met someone on hackathon, we created telegram chat and they knew us. We were speaking with them about integration one inch, if it's a liquidity source or just partnership or just speaking because they are also hackers, software developers.
00:12:18.310 - 00:13:17.734, Speaker A: Then when we created new release, if you integrate a new source, we introduced a new algorithm which used multiple market depths like this multi routing algorithm which we introduced back in 2020, end of 2020, we just used memes and worked with the community. We spoke with the community and our community was growing, growing. Of course, there were some dramas with competitors who just start to use our code without taking care about IP rights, copyrights and licenses. But we sorted it out. But yeah, we couldn't hire anyone. So Michelle was like, we called us two and a half men like Anton and Michelle, who was like little bit in a part time, little bit helping us. She became advisor and then she's still our lead software engineer.
00:13:17.734 - 00:13:19.082, Speaker A: We are really happy to have them.
00:13:19.136 - 00:13:19.354, Speaker B: Nice.
00:13:19.392 - 00:13:24.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess early 2020, we got some funds from the community.
00:13:25.090 - 00:13:25.886, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:26.068 - 00:13:41.150, Speaker A: We participate on Gitcoin grant. I asked actually grant from Ethereum foundation, but they declined. Oh, wow. Yeah. They said they don't see no value in one inch. And I thought, okay, that's really sad. That's really sad.
00:13:41.150 - 00:14:14.490, Speaker A: We are now the biggest three application out there staying together with uniswap. And we did it from zero to current situation. We have $200 to $500 million volume every day. So it's really huge. So someone from the community had fingers and typed not five k, he typed somehow fifty k. And he donated through Gitcoin grant. And we were really like shocked.
00:14:14.490 - 00:14:28.500, Speaker A: And we asked this guy, maybe this is a mistake. And he said like, yes, this is a mistake. He had fingers, but it's okay, guys, you deserve it. Do something with this money. Build something with this money. I'm using your product. I love your product.
00:14:28.500 - 00:14:57.660, Speaker A: It solved my pain. And we thought like, okay, nice, very nice. And we used this money to hire Kirill. He is our right now senior lead, back end engineer and blockchain engineer as well. And he was, I guess 21 or something and he was working like a beast. It's not really that we hired them. We had consulting agreements with them.
00:14:57.660 - 00:15:38.322, Speaker A: So they have also kind of also skin in the game. He got also some allocations then from the foundation with the tokens because he contributed early and we just used the money to pay him so he can live and work for these projects. And we ourselves, we didn't pay to ourselves at all. And we were just trying to use this money which we got from the community, highly efficient and to not waste it, we started, Kirill started to contribute. I also wrote code, anton wrote code. Then some more people came. Nowadays we are 150 around the globe.
00:15:38.322 - 00:16:03.082, Speaker A: Not of course, all software engineers. We have also people who are working with the community, providing support. So if you go to one get, you get a support chat. So you can chat with these guys. You can ask them something. There are people who are writing blog posts like educational content. We have a nice event team, I guess since you are also in Dubai here, I would love to invite you to our parties.
00:16:03.082 - 00:16:15.122, Speaker A: One of our famous products, I would say so like networking bands where you can meet a lot of people and it's really nice atmosphere and yeah, we would love to see you.
00:16:15.176 - 00:16:17.410, Speaker B: That'd be great. Thanks for the invite.
00:16:20.150 - 00:16:51.550, Speaker A: About money at all. For us it was not about the money. It was like a wave, which you know, and this wave is just the community support and also the feedback that people are using something, what you're building. It's like with Zuckerberg, I guess when he started to build Facebook, he was also like, he recognized this is something what people need and use and yeah, that's why we continued to build and we couldn't rate one half years long.
00:16:51.620 - 00:16:52.400, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:16:52.770 - 00:17:52.562, Speaker A: Yeah, it was really difficult. My background is software engineering, software architecture. And I had also my own company for aggregation, for telecommunication services like SMS and providing consulting services to different structures. We have. I had no idea and as well how to raise money, because also the culture of raising money is different. Like if you look into us like Silicon Valley people and you look at Germany, first of all, you never will get a share allocation option for the share for the stock of the company. If you're a developer, I never got an offer.
00:17:52.562 - 00:18:14.410, Speaker A: I asked already for this and you just get paid monthly payments. It's also not very high. And also if you are very experienced, like I had 15 years of software engineering experience. I didn't get a lot of Porsche as well. But for this country it's a lot. When you work for Porsche and get this salary, they look on you that you are rich.
00:18:14.990 - 00:18:16.298, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:18:16.384 - 00:18:45.854, Speaker A: But at the end you have maybe 1000 euro left, which you have left at the end of the month. So you can invest or something. But anyway, we didn't know how to do that and we learned it. So I did in my life at least 1000 pitches, I guess. So I pitched to everyone. I pitched to the dark next from a neighbor, so pitched to everyone. We collected the feedback.
00:18:45.854 - 00:19:14.926, Speaker A: We understood that we need to work with the feedback. If someone asks a critical question, then you need to have answer. One day, I guess dragonfly came and said, like, guys, why you have millions, like tens of millions every month on volume? Why you didn't raise yet what was going on? And we were still like three, four persons in this structure working. We didn't have even a company for.
00:19:14.948 - 00:19:18.510, Speaker B: This straight out of the hackathon.
00:19:19.170 - 00:19:55.878, Speaker A: And they said like, take our money. And we're like, okay, cool, nice. And after that, also binance started to move faster. So we were also communicating with binance and CZ was not really moving forward. We got also feedback from some german investors. They said, like, guys, you had just luck, and we are not sure that you can continue with building, innovating and growing in the space or in general. So they just said, like, we have luck, we got luck.
00:19:55.878 - 00:20:31.880, Speaker A: And I told them, okay, fine, it's okay, it's fine. We were able to save the first financial round, and three months later we closed the second one because the demand was really high. It started like, it became really, I don't know, famous to try to get investment in money. Yeah. And end of 2021, we raised the third round. So in total we raised, I guess 190,000,000. And we have like 26 years or something to operate with this money right now.
00:20:33.930 - 00:20:55.630, Speaker B: When you got this money, how did you know how to allocate it? I'm sure you did like previous startups in the past, but when you get this abundance of money and you have this first protocol or first project, how do you know where to put it and keep your ip safe when you hire and manage everyone while you're wearing all these hats? It's very chaotic in these times.
00:20:55.700 - 00:21:33.340, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. The thing is, so I'm coming from South Germany. There's a specific culture, it's kind of swebing country, we call it Germany. There's specific culture to be efficient in spending of money, of resources and so on. I grew up there as I was born in Siberia, in Russia, back in the days, grew up from twelve years in Germany. I still keep it. Also nowadays we have the approach that we spend only for efficient things.
00:21:33.340 - 00:22:23.542, Speaker A: So we got more people involved. And of course we had some mistakes in terms of like, there were some people who became greedy, but we reacted very fastly and removed those people also from our structures, which we have to avoid damages. But it works very well, actually. We have nice people, we have people in South Korea who have also very interesting approach for how to approach like mentality in terms of working culture. So they are strict, they are highly committed. Give everything. This is actually our dna.
00:22:23.542 - 00:22:57.558, Speaker A: We give everything. That's why we called us in the early days when we were participating on hackathons, crypto maniacs. In terms of maniacs like that, we overcommitting to everything what we're doing. You need to take care, you need to have overview if you're building your startup. My first kind of side project, this telecommunication aggregation company, it was built with my own money, with small money and with almost no resources. And I had two developers. Then I removed these developers and did everything by myself.
00:22:57.558 - 00:23:09.974, Speaker A: Then you need to learn to understand everything what's going on. If you have such a company, you need to really to understand the work. And you should be ready to do the work by yourself.
00:23:10.092 - 00:23:11.260, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%.
00:23:11.870 - 00:23:13.434, Speaker A: Just very important. Yeah.
00:23:13.472 - 00:23:56.550, Speaker B: If you have no money, you only have yourself or your friends. And you need to be a technical founder, unless you have money. And the only way to be that is to have really in depth expertise in whatever field, or at least have an edge in some way, have some creative edge to actually get traction. And I think one of the hardest things is really getting over those big humps to getting to an MVP and getting off the ground. That's where most startups fail, is getting to the MVP. And even just trying to get lift off is the hardest part. And so what were the hardest things you've experienced while building one inch and even past startups?
00:23:57.950 - 00:24:41.800, Speaker A: The thing is, when we have built the first version of one inch on the hackathon, we were already ready, kind of to have this walking speed like development speed, because we learned through participating on all the hackathons, we learn how to deliver fast, highly efficient. But on a hackathon you have just two nights, right? Yeah. It's a good example in New York that I didn't sleep 56 hours. It was crazy. It's like crazy for my body. I almost died at the end. The room started to change behind me, but I was focused on a computer, like on MacBook, writing the last pieces of code.
00:24:41.800 - 00:25:21.086, Speaker A: We learn how to move fast. It's very important to people who are raising building startups, innovating. We need to go fast. It's okay to build something over two days. It fulfill maybe a need for like half year, maybe a microservice, for example, and then you can just drop it, just destroy it and build a new one every time. Refreshing code, building new things, and building some things which solve a pain right now for maybe one year, it's okay. I get sometimes people here at one inch that we have some different teams and team leads.
00:25:21.086 - 00:25:54.078, Speaker A: They hire by themselves, consultors or inside of our structures or companies. I get people who are coming from enterprise and saying, whoa, in two years we'll have trouble. And I tell them one year in web three is like 1020 years in traditional world. It's changing every month something, someone gets hacked. Someone introduced a new innovation, Unisoft start to do the same as we do. We need to adapt. We need to adapt and you need to go fast.
00:25:54.078 - 00:26:27.714, Speaker A: You cannot plan for two years, you can even plan for one year. And this is the challenge sometimes to get the right people on board with whom you can push. And sometimes we do hackathons. The last, last fusion upgrade, which we did last December, it took one month to build. It sounds like one month. It cannot be. We had eleven billions of us dollars on fusion.
00:26:27.714 - 00:27:10.578, Speaker A: Fusion is this new decentralized Nasdaq approach, which we introduced, where you have this little bit account abstraction, where you just give a permission that you want to trade one asset against another asset in a specific price range. And a dutch auction starts and market makers come and execute against your aura and they compete with each other, so you get the best execution. We have built it just over a month. I can tell you how it was. It was like early 2022. I recognized that I was front run. Yeah, I provided liquidity to uniswap.
00:27:10.578 - 00:27:54.030, Speaker A: I also tweeted about that, had an also rectangle on that and wrote to me and PM like, hey, how we can help or can you explain a little bit more? So we understand. But we got these problems with math, with bots who are front running people and sandwich them to extract maximal value from the transaction of the user. Someone exchanging on uniswap, then you get sandwiched or other changes because they didn't think about map protection when they have built these protocols. That's why I came to the idea. But it cannot be, it's really not user friendly. It's a pain. And I came to your why not to introduce any kind of abstraction layer.
00:27:54.030 - 00:28:26.190, Speaker A: User just gives you permit like an aura. It's done on Nasdaq for example. And someone who is highly professional and can protect themselves from math execute it. If someone needs to arbitrage, they can use flashbots like these market makers. We have ten market makers right now listed on one inch in our network. Market makers like resolvers we call them, they're acting like validators, they execute some work. And this is feeling matching orders from users.
00:28:26.190 - 00:29:02.102, Speaker A: And they can protect by themselves and they can even work with own liquidity so they don't have to use flashboards or something. They just work with own liquidity and fill from own wallets. Order and hedge on centralized exchanges. So I came to my guys and we have multiple teams. I pitched this initiative. So we have initiative system bones here with us and everyone can come with initiative and can pitch and explain why we should do that. And we started to work on fusion solution on this new swap, new art, new kind of swaps.
00:29:02.102 - 00:29:22.430, Speaker A: And I recognized that it's very slow. We are distributed around the globe. It's really like this lack of communication or potentially also a little bit leadership in terms of that. They need to be one who pushing it. I tried to push it, but anyway, it's difficult. And I told guys, we need to meet. And we did a hackathon in Dubai.
00:29:22.430 - 00:29:45.974, Speaker A: I spent a little money to get a hotel. We got a lot of people. I guess it was like 40 people. Yes. With families, with kids, with wives, with husbands. And we had a room. It was a restaurant, actually.
00:29:45.974 - 00:30:27.140, Speaker A: But we reserved this restaurant for us only. And we were working there, hacking there over months. And in this month we were able to finish the full work, which was necessarily to publish it to production. In this time, we got already the security audits of the smart contract and we were able to launch it in December. And nowadays we got eleven billions of us dollars already on fusion. People were always protected by design, from math. So when you right now go and swap on one inch in a fusion mode, it's normally on by default if it's possible to enable it.
00:30:27.140 - 00:30:43.402, Speaker A: You are not facing sandwich attacks anymore, no foreign training attacks. And yeah, we source the whole liquidity on the market. They're market makers who breached liquidity from centralized exchanges. So, yeah, I call it decentralized Nasdaq. It's really like that.
00:30:43.536 - 00:31:04.020, Speaker B: You mentioned you learned all about all this mev stuff, right, to integrate that into fusion, but you built a whole protocol around aggregating the best rates, which sounds great for an mev team, right? Or high frequency trading. So why didn't you go down that route by any chance?
00:31:04.550 - 00:31:34.154, Speaker A: Yeah, before one inch, I was experimenting with arbitrage, so I understood that the money is actually like on the floor, you just to collect it. Yeah, exactly. And I started to do that, but I recognized there are also other people who actually recognize me and start to do the same or front run me. So I thought, but this is really pain. This is really pain. Yeah. And if you use our algorithm for arbitrage we can do it.
00:31:34.154 - 00:32:13.446, Speaker A: Actually, we don't allow it in our services that you choose Ethereum to Ethereum. So actually, you can just say, okay, I exchange one Ethereum to one Ethereum. And in the middle, our algorithm will find all arbitrage opportunities in one single transaction. So you just need two calls, one call to get the quote and one call to get the call data. And then you can actually execute by yourself. So you can arbitrage easily. But we understand that the market is small and how much money can you do from it? Of course, if you look on the Mafbots right now, first of all, it's actually not legal from our point of view, what they do is front running and sandwich, from our point of view, is stealing money.
00:32:13.446 - 00:32:39.310, Speaker A: This is illegal activity. And then back in the early days, we had less people generating volumes. Now, this is different. But I would never do that. It's doing something bad instead of doing something good. And we decided to do something good. And this is actually offering arbitrage algorithm to everyone to became arbitrage trader.
00:32:39.730 - 00:32:41.214, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:32:41.412 - 00:33:19.462, Speaker A: Actually, everyone, when someone swap and manage, they get the best execution. Because under the hood, arbitrage algorithms are used to split among. Also in the back days, I guess no one was like, splitting among these exchanges. They were just, okay, this order, which I can front run and then trade on one in single source. But no one was using algorithms in terms of other multiplass algorithms. I don't know when you need to arbitrage all different markets in one single transaction. So we introduced this back in 2020 with this multipass algorithm.
00:33:19.462 - 00:33:52.370, Speaker A: No one was doing it before us. I actually built it on the couch of my sister, the first algorithm, sitting with Anton on the call. And we were thinking, it's not efficient to swap just one market, like UDC to Ethereum. It makes sense to exchange UDC to Ethereum, USDC to USDT, and then to ethereum, because there's also liquidity. USDC to ethereum, right. And jump from USDC to USDT is not painful. There's low slippage.
00:33:52.370 - 00:34:11.370, Speaker A: So it makes sense. And we started to build a prototype. I built graphs. I draw graphs by hand. And we came to a solution, which is nowadays our pathfinder algorithm. We still improve it. I have a new approach right now, also graph based.
00:34:11.440 - 00:34:30.654, Speaker B: Have you ever thought about doing like cross chain, like one inch? Instead of aggregating just a single chain, you aggregate the entire ecosystem of blockchain. Although there might be like a bridge fee, it might still be more efficient to do on one chain and transfer over to another one. I don't know if that's something you thought about, but it seems like it could be an avenue.
00:34:30.702 - 00:34:50.854, Speaker A: So the thing is, if we would integrate aggregation among bridges and swaps, it became not atomic. Yeah, this is a problem. So theoretically the user can face bad experience in terms of that they swap.
00:34:50.902 - 00:34:53.114, Speaker B: Bridge and then the rate changes.
00:34:53.232 - 00:35:32.374, Speaker A: While you're waiting, the rate change, they face slippage or the breach and then try to swap. It doesn't work because rates change or the breach was hacked and we see breaches as not efficient solution. We have something in the pipeline. So right now we met with our teammates, also with my co founder Anton, we came to something, what is more efficient than a bridge? And we discovered this situation right now. So Uniswap also decided to go cross chain. I guess they use a fork of something. What I understood from our point of view, it's like if you do something what is not efficient and introduce risks for the user, maybe you shouldn't do that.
00:35:32.374 - 00:36:09.346, Speaker A: It's like with the morphe slow, if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. And we try your words. When we write smart contracts, they are highly efficient, they are small, and if you don't have anything, what can break, then it will not break. We have no admin keys, admin rights or something. This just smart contract which is written in the stone program can be changed and maybe stopped. Yeah, I guess Dow can stop our contracts in terms of like, if there's availability or something. We try to make as many security audits as possible.
00:36:09.346 - 00:36:34.598, Speaker A: I guess last one was around ten security audits for the last release. Yeah. Crosschain is a special topic. We are discovering right now what we can do. Potentially we have a good solution which would work also with bitcoin. So just imagine you sell your Ethereum for bitcoin and you get real bitcoin in your bitcoin wallet. Yeah, it is highly safe, highly secure and highly efficient.
00:36:34.598 - 00:36:43.402, Speaker A: And yeah, we are discovering also the same adding bitcoin support to our one inch wallet, self custody wallet, which you can download on App Store. We also discovered two ads.
00:36:43.466 - 00:37:00.946, Speaker B: As a founder, co founder, I think it's a psychological game of success, of really being able to push through all the struggles you go through at the start. And it sounds like you've been through a lot as well in this journey. Doing it on your sister's couch is what you said before, right?
00:37:01.128 - 00:37:01.860, Speaker A: Yes.
00:37:02.710 - 00:37:23.500, Speaker B: What was kind of going through your mind at that time? I know the startup life is super hard, and if you're in a position financially as well. That is also tough and you're going through all these other external things. What did it really take to get to the point where you are now and push through all this stuff and really believe that you can do it?
00:37:24.110 - 00:37:24.474, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:24.512 - 00:37:31.200, Speaker B: So I guess how did you really face all these challenges and what was going through your mind during these times?
00:37:32.130 - 00:38:44.578, Speaker A: I would say just do it. I'm really feeling based person, Howard said, I have no degrees, so I'm also very bad in algorithms. But based on the feelings, I can recognize that maybe this way is a good way. And I would suggest to everyone if someone thinking about starting startup or going also just to became own boss and starting to providing consulting services, if it feels good, the idea feels good, then do it and keep doing it. Of course I tried really long time from 2007, also provide consulting services and also have got the aggregation, aggregate request, SMS communication services. And of course it's difficult because you have potentially not enough experience. Maybe you need someone like I got like Anton Book of my co founder which is experienced in different fields than I am.
00:38:44.578 - 00:39:38.242, Speaker A: And of course we have some matches as well where we are both experienced, but we fulfill to each other. Of course it's sometimes difficult to find a person with whom you can work because people start to became kind of about attraction. If you get more traction, if you get money, then people start to act differently. It's really difficult to find the co funder, but also for every person individually, if it's from up and over, it feels good in terms of like, okay, this is what I want to do. It's also about freedom. A human is happy when the person gets freedom and can do what they want. Of course there are people, they just want to sit on the couch and watch tv.
00:39:38.242 - 00:40:46.220, Speaker A: But it's like a motivation question. And in 2019, I was sleeping only three, 4 hours a day and I somehow figured out it was working. Sometimes I had to sleep on weekends, maybe a little bit more. But week over, when I was driving with the train to the office where I was working, like for poor, for consulting companies, I didn't watch movies, didn't hear music or something. I opened my MacBook and I wrote code, I experimented. When I came back from 8910 hours job, I spent time with my daughter, with my family, and in the night I started to work on my own things. For example, I discovered new technology, I did some experimentations like r and d, like research, did my research, I developed myself always and this is hard work through the whole life.
00:40:46.220 - 00:41:23.350, Speaker A: So also the beginning in the school, I had my school. After the school, I spent almost the whole time to work on technologies, to learn software engineering. So I learned actually programming by myself and then got the last kind of knowledge in the company where I started to learn software development. We have in Germany, specific approach. You don't have to study. You can just work in the company. Three, four weeks and a couple of weeks you go to the school, and then after three, four years, you're a software engineer.
00:41:23.350 - 00:41:43.340, Speaker A: The thing is, I spend more time to develop myself. And no one can take it from you, from no one. Your knowledge, this, everything gave me the chance to build this. What we have right now, together with Anton, other people who joined us.
00:41:46.450 - 00:41:55.214, Speaker B: Yeah, 100% skills. There's two things that really, I think, allow you to capture an opportunity. There's money and then there's just skills.
00:41:55.262 - 00:42:11.462, Speaker A: And the money thing is, of course, money makes life comfortable, but it's not something what is really necessarily to have to get success to achieve something.
00:42:11.516 - 00:42:13.240, Speaker B: It's a great system.
00:42:13.930 - 00:42:33.722, Speaker A: Yes. Just spend your free time. Less people spend on free time for research to learn something. It's really difficult. I don't know. Also in my family, if I look, my sister, for example, she would like to know more about web three space. I told her where to start.
00:42:33.722 - 00:42:49.618, Speaker A: I told her, read two books from Coin Geeko, how to defi for beginners and for advanced, and then you will a little bit understand already. But she's not doing it. She started to do this, but she broke. She doesn't feel passion. She should do it.
00:42:49.704 - 00:42:50.914, Speaker B: And the drive to do it.
00:42:50.952 - 00:43:33.374, Speaker A: You need passion. Yeah, you need your passion. And this is something what drives you? What drives me always. If I don't understand something, I try to find explanation and try to understand how this works. And also I very often use people, so I'm a little bit abuser, I would say. So if someone is really nice training in terms of psychological approaches, working with business partners or employees or something, I ask them, what is this about? And I try to do cherry picking. I ask them, okay, this is nice.
00:43:33.374 - 00:43:58.678, Speaker A: Explain. So what did you understood? So I try to get the knowledge from people, which is already compressed. The information is already kind of ready for me to consume, so it's easier for me to just speak with someone to get the knowledge. I guess Elon Musk is doing the same. He asked people like, what do you think about this material? Why this material? Why not another material for, I don't.
00:43:58.684 - 00:44:13.070, Speaker B: Know, like when you interact with a human, they're like extreme aggregators of information. If you can talk to them for some time, then you can extract a lot of alpha.
00:44:14.050 - 00:44:14.462, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:14.516 - 00:44:17.230, Speaker B: You became experience and whatnot.
00:44:17.570 - 00:44:29.220, Speaker A: Yeah. You became also very knowledgeable. The same with my co founder. I started to participate with film on the hackathons. I learned a lot. I learned in one year what I didn't learn in the last ten years before.
00:44:29.910 - 00:45:15.330, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you did 17, right? You just went across the globe and you learn a ton in those environments. You got a very restrictive time frame to get stuff done and that will build a lot of skills that you wouldn't get otherwise, I think, unless you're purposely giving yourself time restrictions. But it's also a competition as well. So that's also a massive driver. But once you got off the ground and got to where you are now, and you've gone through this entire phase of startup life to now becoming a pioneer in the space, what do you think you should have done differently when you look back at it, to get to the point where you are now or even further?
00:45:16.310 - 00:45:44.298, Speaker A: I wouldn't change anything. Yeah. Really nothing. Of course, I wish that I would maybe buy 2011 some bitcoin or would start to invest every month 100 euro into bitcoin from 2011 where I got first touch points with it. But if I would do this, I wouldn't be able maybe to build one inch together in front of.
00:45:44.304 - 00:45:46.074, Speaker B: You're being a different environment, right?
00:45:46.192 - 00:46:38.700, Speaker A: Completely. Yeah. I would get rich with the first bull run, then with the bull run, maybe 2018 and very rich if I would start to invest in 2011 and then what would I do? It's like you win something if you investing money and get a lot of it, like thousand x's or something from it. It's different to something where you earn in terms of like you do some work and best of your work, you get something for this. And this is two different things. Sometimes not sometimes, very often it's happening. When someone win a lot of money, like hundreds of millions or tens of millions or maybe 1 million, they actually face a huge problem.
00:46:38.700 - 00:47:11.862, Speaker A: They get sick also mentally. The gold of the life. It is a problem. Better is to work to improve your skills, to earn this money. And when you earn, then you understand how to spend it. You understand how difficult it is to get it to my friends or family. Sometimes someone comes and asks for money, they ask personal troubles, I don't know.
00:47:11.862 - 00:48:11.690, Speaker A: And I try to explain them that I'm not a bank. It was really hard to earn this money. I have huge responsibility and I have my family, my parents my sisters, I need to take care about them and also about me and this money which I earn every month and earned before, it was difficult to get it for sure. For normal people in Germany who get 2000 euro a month, it's a lot of money. What I get maybe right now as a compensation, monthly compensation for my work, it's a lot, but it's also hard for me every day I spent on the phone. Like we communicate a lot because it's a lot of people. I spend a lot of time also with my work, less for my private life.
00:48:11.690 - 00:48:28.030, Speaker A: I traveling a lot, I do keynotes. It's also hard work. I need to prepare myself. It's difficult also to speak to all these people out there. Yeah, definitely. Traveling is really nightmare. Becomes nightmare to travel around the globe.
00:48:28.030 - 00:48:31.994, Speaker A: Next month I go to Australia, it's 16 hours of flight.
00:48:32.122 - 00:48:32.574, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
00:48:32.612 - 00:48:38.158, Speaker A: And then after Australia I go to Istanbul. Looks like it's 22 hours of flight.
00:48:38.254 - 00:49:21.514, Speaker B: Yeah, Australia is just far away, bro. That's why it's middle of nowhere. But yeah, I think definitely curating your network is probably the main thing in any success. Or at least it would definitely help get to where you want to go. For me, this podcast has been amazing because I've spoken to so many people in so many areas and then I extend myself into their network and then it keeps expanding like that. And it's just been terrific in a way that I can extract domain knowledge in just an hour, but also have a good conversation with them. Because I think a lot of people, once you get to this high level, it's very repetitive of explaining what you're doing, et cetera.
00:49:21.514 - 00:49:37.880, Speaker B: But it's good to release your whole life and at least get it out there because I don't think a lot of people really ask that. It's more about I want to use you to learn how I can do the same so I can get the money, et cetera. I think the genuine connection is kind of hard to come by.
00:49:39.450 - 00:49:52.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess people should be not money driven from our point of view. They should be success driven. And when you have success, then money is I guess like something works just like inevitable, just comes automatically.
00:49:52.670 - 00:50:04.960, Speaker B: And I want to touch point on the mining. The mining is quite interesting. So did you ever like how did you get into that and why aren't you doing it now? Because I think it's still a great skill to have.
00:50:07.810 - 00:50:28.554, Speaker A: It was funny to build on Rick. So I have seen a video on YouTube and I thought like, wow, that's nice. You can put like six, seven graphic cards on one motherboard. It's crazy. I just played around, did some research. It was funny to build something like that. And it was funny that it was profitable to mine.
00:50:28.554 - 00:50:50.270, Speaker A: One day it became not profitable in Germany to mine at all. So I stopped to do this. I had like, I don't know, 15 electricity consumption. It was a lot. It's like one other graphic card or something. Yeah, I sold also before the crash. I got my God feeling again.
00:50:50.270 - 00:51:24.566, Speaker A: And I got the feeling that it's time to sell. And actually I sold for more money than I bought. So I did some profit on the halfway and I used it one year or something or three years. It was funny. It was also a good thing to understand how that works, how proof of work works, how the network works, how the communication between node works. Such things are really interesting. It was for me a nice pet project.
00:51:24.748 - 00:51:25.960, Speaker B: Oh yeah, for sure.
00:51:26.410 - 00:51:33.100, Speaker A: Spent a lot of time for this. I was building all the own mining rigs completely by myself.
00:51:33.550 - 00:51:50.510, Speaker B: I think it's a niche skill because I don't think a lot of people are even doing that. And I think it could translate very well into optimizing your own nodes, editing them, but also going to block building relays, validators. And these are increasingly more, I guess neat.
00:51:50.930 - 00:52:14.226, Speaker A: Nowadays I have only 24 hours a day. Yeah, I have a lot of keynotes in Dubai. Like last week I had two keynotes, participated on three different conference blockchains. Future summit is coming. I'm speaking there as well. There's a lot of people, a lot of people coming to me who would like to speak with me. Some of them pitch some ideas.
00:52:14.226 - 00:53:14.054, Speaker A: It's also interesting to see there are new projects coming, new innovators coming. It's interesting to get some feedback from the community in terms of also user experience or maybe I understand that a lot of people didn't recognize that we have own self custody wall. Yeah, it's really funny. We have two teams working for this and trying to explain people to push on board people. But yeah it's a good feedback but it's difficult with the time and I cannot do everything. I'm doing a little bit research also in my free time when I have 3 hours or in airplane building on new algorithm approaches, testing it or building on PTP networks. I like this idea with PTP network where everyone can participate and don't have to trust anyone can verify everything with the cryptographical approaches.
00:53:14.054 - 00:53:23.858, Speaker A: So we are also researching. There's also another team right now try to join two to one inch teams with the research of PTP network for one inch.
00:53:23.974 - 00:53:34.242, Speaker B: And one final question is, where do you see yourself in the next year? Because I know five years, it's very hard to kind of envision that a lot can change in just one year, right?
00:53:34.376 - 00:53:34.770, Speaker A: Yes.
00:53:34.840 - 00:53:40.500, Speaker B: I want to know where do you want to see yourself in one year? Where do you picture yourself.
00:53:43.430 - 00:54:41.794, Speaker A: In one year? Yes, I think I will contribute as much as can into one inch network in the next twelve months above like the next feature for sure. I tried to introduce something what would also improve the space with my teams. Like in personal manner, I wish to spend more time with my daughter. So right now I need to travel a lot and she's with my ex wife and I try to spend more time with my daughter. It's family as well. So my family also comes to me sometimes. The next holidays we will vacations in school with my sister, with her children, my daughter.
00:54:41.794 - 00:55:42.794, Speaker A: We will go to Dubai here and spend some time together. Yeah, I think I will continue my research, like working to improve web three space for sure, by contributing to one inch network and traveling around the globe and onboarding more people. Sometimes I'm wondering myself when I go on a stage and ask people, can you explain what is the deck? This was maybe one guy in the crowd saying he knows this is maybe not the right answer on a crypto conference. Still new people and we need to educate them. I'm pushing also a topic right now here inside of one h network with the own book that we write, own book about the tree. Just kind of my goals, like family in terms of professional things, pushing forward what we are already doing.
00:55:42.912 - 00:55:59.902, Speaker B: Yeah. Nice. And hopefully you might even stumble across a new interest as well, and you go pursue that on top of one inch. But yeah, it's been terrific talking to you, Sergey, and I'm super pleased you jumped on at such short notice. And I think it's been a terrific chat. And thank you so much for jumping on.
00:56:00.036 - 00:56:07.118, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a pleasure to come and speak here. Yeah. And Howard said, come to our party. Let's meet.
00:56:07.204 - 00:56:14.790, Speaker B: Let's do it. Let's do it, man. Cool. Thank you everybody for listening. And thank you so much, Sergey, for jumping on. Everybody. Take care.
00:56:14.980 - 00:56:15.700, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
