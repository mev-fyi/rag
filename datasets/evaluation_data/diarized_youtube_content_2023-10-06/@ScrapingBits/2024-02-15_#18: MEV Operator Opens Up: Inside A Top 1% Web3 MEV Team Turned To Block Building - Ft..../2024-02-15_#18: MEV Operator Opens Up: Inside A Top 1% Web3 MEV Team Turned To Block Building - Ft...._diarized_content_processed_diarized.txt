00:00:00.250 - 00:00:15.550, Speaker A: There were actually days like you, you go to sleep and you just wake up and there's like $1,000 like burned into just fees reversing peace. And you, you didn't just see like ten pages of reverts on either scan.
00:00:16.130 - 00:00:23.694, Speaker B: GMGM, everyone. My name is Digacy. I'm your host with scraping bits, and I'm here with ox princess, how's it going?
00:00:23.812 - 00:00:37.110, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm doing fine, thank you. I really appreciate that you invited me this podcast and yeah, I really want to thank you. Thank you and thank all the listeners. Really glad to chat and answer all the questions that you have.
00:00:37.180 - 00:00:48.506, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. It should be a good one. And thank you for coming on. I know it's taken time out of your day and a lot of MeV searches don't want to actually come on, so it should be quite interesting.
00:00:48.608 - 00:00:49.420, Speaker A: No problem.
00:00:50.190 - 00:00:53.902, Speaker B: Having said that, let's do a quick intro of what you do currently.
00:00:54.036 - 00:01:27.510, Speaker A: Yeah, so currently we are a team of three people, and we do full time searching since the summer of 2020. And we are mostly focused on interchain arbitrage, on Ethereum and binance smart chain, and that's what we mostly do. And we have some of the south side projects like the builder on Ethereum we are working on, and some other interesting stuff that will be very useful for DeFi users on Ethereum.
00:01:28.250 - 00:01:31.190, Speaker B: What is interchange arbitrage? Is that like cross chain?
00:01:31.270 - 00:02:11.702, Speaker A: Yeah. So the interchange arbitrage is now the crosschain would be, I think interchange arbitrage, like intrachain should be inside one chain. So that's like atomic arbitrage, the most usual atomic arbitrage you could think of. So if there's like two pools on Ethereum, one on Univ. Two and one Univ. Three, and they're like imbalanced, you can arbitrage them in an atomic way just after the target transaction that imbalances this pulse. So that's kind of arbitrage we are doing.
00:02:11.702 - 00:03:08.530, Speaker A: And is the second common arbitrage inside one chain after. Not the arbitrage, but the MeV stuff you can do after the sandwiching. But the sandwiching is very hostile and extractive and it's also very competitive and the risk and all this stuff. And so we decided to focus on the more safer and way to actually not extract from value from the user, from the users and risk our reputation and other stuff, but hold the inventory in tokens and like the Jared do. And yeah, it was just normal arbitrage and it is right now, and it was called arbitrary. Before, flashbots popularized the term mev, but now it's all Mev.
00:03:08.690 - 00:03:20.220, Speaker B: How did you get into all of this in 2020? How did you get into it? I assume you did it as a solo searcher to start with, and then you eventually built team.
00:03:20.690 - 00:04:05.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually not started alone, but with a friend of mine. It started in a really interesting way. So I was watching the crypto space very closely. I was even trading a little, and I saw one of the telegram channels that I was subscribed to. I saw the one inch doing ask me anything session, and I just went to it, and then I didn't know what one inch is or what DeFi is. Yeah, I just knew all the chains, but I didn't go into the smart context on ethereum and et cetera. Didn't really use any of dapps yet.
00:04:05.820 - 00:05:34.454, Speaker A: And I went to this session, and I learned what one inch are doing, and I went to their website, and they just implemented this split feature where when you split the liquidity in the router into different pools, it wasn't a thing back then. So you were just swapping inside one pool, and they did a router that split the liquidity. And I saw how big imbalanced the split was were, and I thought that if 99% goes into one pool and 1% to the other, so the liquidity in these pools are like 100 x different. And so if there's a transaction that goes not through one inch, but through the pool with very little liquidity, it will actually create a crazy imbalance, and that actually would be a window for arbitrage. And I was aware of the concept of the arbitrage and how that works between different taxes, the centralized exchanges, and. Yes, so I thought it might be possible to just implement it into defi, and I didn't know if it was even possible to swap between different pools and one transaction, et cetera. I didn't really knew the solidity and stuff.
00:05:34.454 - 00:06:59.934, Speaker A: My background was mostly like back end development, and I just went, my friend who's a math major, and, yeah, we just sat and brainstormed for one day and just started this journey, and he created a proof of concept in one week that just worked. And we created this simple proof of concept in Python, and it was just a simple graph of the pools, and we just tracked, and not even opportunities created by single transactions, but by the window opportunities that occurred after a block comes out. And, yeah, we just captured a single opportunity for $2,000, and this window was open for a week, and obed captured it. Yeah. So it was really crazy because the most searchers would capture the opportunities between known pools. So it looked like there wasn't really an automated pool discovery searches yet. So no one just did it in the automatic way, but just they whitelisted pools in their configs, and they arbitrage between different known pools, and we just did the automatic pool discovery.
00:06:59.934 - 00:08:00.194, Speaker A: So we discovered the pool that just no one saw for like a week. Yeah. After this success, like the instant settlements of the one transaction that was our first transaction for two k, we actually thought that it's actually working. It might be a good stuff to be doing for the next half a year. And we started iterating over this concept and improving our smart contracts, improving our code, rewriting everything from scratch. And at the current date, we did maybe ten completely different versions of our bot ten times, because we're doing it already, like three years. So we actually constantly rewriting on the stuff from scratch because we have to adapt to the landscape.
00:08:00.194 - 00:08:39.126, Speaker A: A lot of new protocols are being added constantly, and some of these protocols are just not fitting our current architecture. And so we have to rewrite it to be compatible. And sometimes it requires breaking everything, rewriting it from scratch. And so we had one bot, one version that was working for half a year without any changes, while we were rewriting everything from scratch to raise a completely new, very complex version of this new bot.
00:08:39.258 - 00:08:41.950, Speaker B: And what was the process of building the new iterations?
00:08:42.110 - 00:09:18.410, Speaker A: The pipeline was like the following. We saw that the new protocol comes out, and it becomes really popular, like it was in Univ. Three case. Right? So when the Univ. Three came out, searchers that did Univ. Three arbitrage were very profitable, orders of magnitude more profitable than other searches, because Univ. Three math is still something that most people are struggling with, even with ill being right, not even mentioning distortion on it and doing an arbitrage.
00:09:18.410 - 00:10:15.714, Speaker A: So it's still very complex math. Inside smart contracts and outside smart contracts, you have to consider a lot of things, and the pool logic is different, and et cetera. We saw the unity three gat comes out, for example, and we understand that it might not fit our current bot architecture. So what we are doing is we are just completely leaving the current version as it is. So it's just running, and we just forget about it, and we're just starting to rewrite everything from scratch. Considering the existence on the Univ. Three and how we will fit into our searching architecture, it just takes maybe one month to rewrite everything.
00:10:15.714 - 00:10:25.220, Speaker A: And then with a completely new version with a completely new set of bugs running the bot. Yeah.
00:10:26.970 - 00:10:33.894, Speaker B: Did you ever run the bot and then the bugs were detrimental. Like you lost money once running it.
00:10:33.932 - 00:11:11.246, Speaker A: Maybe there was problems like that because it was a thing on Ethereum in early days, in pre flash bot days, because you were actually sending the transaction to the transaction pool. Right. It was almost always reversing. So for ten transactions sent, maybe one transactions were actually lending and not reverting. And of course, you will be losing the fees paid for the reverted transaction. Right. So, out of ten transaction, you would pay for nine transaction for the reverts.
00:11:11.246 - 00:12:10.390, Speaker A: And the problem is, it's like one to ten ratio, but when it comes, like, zero to ten, you just pay the actually real hard to debug, because the transaction passes all the simulations and all the stuff that you would check before sending it. And in your simulations, it should land 100%. And when it doesn't land, you don't really know why it didn't land. So it might be like your competitors that frontrun you. It might be like hostel miner that excluded this transaction or put it in the place where it reverted. Yeah. So there was a multitude of reasons why it would revert, and it was no actually way to track it and even not any ways to troubleshoot it.
00:12:10.390 - 00:12:49.950, Speaker A: So there were actually days like, you go to sleep and you just wake up, and there's like $1,000 burns into just fees, reversing fees, and you didn't see like, ten pages of reverts on either scan, and you just crash. Yeah. And it happened many times. And this was actually the case how you can just lose a lot of money. Yeah. After the flashbots, it wasn't actually the case. I think because we did atomic stuff, we had like, two risks.
00:12:49.950 - 00:13:37.010, Speaker A: And this was the unbundling that was actually tested in practice by some guy that's currently known as slow carbo crusader. Right. So he unbundled, but it was the risks for sandwiches, and we did not do sandwiches. But if unbundled, our transaction might revert, and we'll still have to pay for the reverse. And the other thing is the smart contract vulnerability. So you might know the guy, big grug, grug capital. So he is known for just doing independent audits of searches, contracts.
00:13:37.010 - 00:14:13.614, Speaker A: Yeah, independent audits for vulnerabilities and callbacks and other stuff in unchecked permissions. This is also a great risk. It's not currently the case in our smart contract, because we use the flash loans for most of of our operations, because you can just do a flash loan in Univ. Two pool, and as far as I remember, maybe in Univ. Three even, but in Univ. Two for sure. Yeah, you can do that.
00:14:13.614 - 00:14:45.042, Speaker A: And you would not pay any fees for this, if I remember correctly, before we had to just had our own inventory and yeah, we were risking it when doing our transactions if there's any vulnerability in the callback and other stuff, but yeah, now, because we just do the flash loans, we don't risk anything in our bank. So, yeah, it's a really safe way to do this stuff on chain.
00:14:45.186 - 00:15:10.554, Speaker B: Yeah, the flash loans are super beneficial because you can just basically borrow millions of dollars and then make a profit with those millions of dollars and pay back the fee. Yeah, but then you've already made money, so it doesn't really matter. But it's really expensive as well, gas wise. So if you're trying to basically compete with someone that's got a massive incentive, then that's kind of a detriment. But it depends on how much money you're making. Right. And your strategies, et cetera.
00:15:10.602 - 00:15:46.426, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So that's the reason why the space is really competitive, and many of the top searchers have very unscure contracts, I think. So there is a trade off. Right. So, yeah, you might be doing stuff like flash loans, and it will spend a lot of gas, and you will be just using your own inventory for your operations. You'll be just risking it. And it's like all about risk perception of you as a team.
00:15:46.426 - 00:16:59.374, Speaker A: So I think for us, it's much more interesting to not risk our inventory, but rather just pay. Be a little bit more, a little bit less competitive on the market, but be safe because you might be seeing a lot of hacks related searches. And unlike hacks of protocols, where there's a lot of users affected, and there's a possibility that team would return something or hacker would return something in case of the searchers, like, there's no one that will stand for you. So if you get hacked, you just lose all the money and nobody say, oh, there's poor searcher. Yeah. So especially after the flashboards has popularized MeV, and the MEV has became a synonym of exploitative math, like sandwiches. Most people think that all the math is not good and it's harming the space and crypto end users.
00:16:59.374 - 00:17:29.882, Speaker A: So when you see news about this search got hacked, people will not care if we're doing sandwiches or we are doing atomic arbitrage, or if we're doing liquidations. People will say, oh, that's the right thing. You should suffer this loss because the bots are bad. I think it's really important just in this space to be safe because there's no one who will stand for you.
00:17:29.936 - 00:17:53.300, Speaker B: Yeah, especially sandwiches. People hate sandwiches basically more than anything else in this space, I think more than rug pools, actually. I feel like people, that rug pool, they get shamed on, but then it's forgotten about for a while. But sandwiches are always popping up and the reputation is just so bad because they make it worse for everyone.
00:17:54.230 - 00:17:54.980, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:57.590 - 00:18:08.070, Speaker B: I wonder. So you started with you and your friend, right? And then you said you have a team of three now. So how did you end up hiring or getting on board another person and trusting?
00:18:08.670 - 00:19:49.206, Speaker A: That's a really interesting story. Yeah, because this is one of the greatest problems of all teams that do searching, because unlike the companies, when you just have an IP right and you have the IP rights that are covering you and so you can sue someone IRL for stealing your ip. In the case of searching, you have almost no foundation, a legal foundation, especially if you are in the country where the laws regarding the crypto is not very stable and there's nothing that covers you in any way. So there's a big problem of trust in the searcher space regarding that. And it's really hard to hire someone, especially an unknown person previously that will do work with you. And it's also really hard to, unlike big companies, where you can actually split responsibilities very clearly and give access, very precise access to the information and the code, et cetera, to the new person in this searcher space, it's really hard because all your services are very entangled. You have almost like a mono repo, right? So you just have everything in one place and you should give a new person access to all of it.
00:19:49.206 - 00:20:56.010, Speaker A: And then you just risk it, because if it's a good code that doesn't have any bugs, critical bugs, someone just might copy it and just leave your team on the second day and just run it yourself, set the fees like 1% higher or like 10% higher and just be your competitor for free, actually. And you'll not be able to sue him or do something with him. Yeah. So that's a great problem of trust that all teams are facing. So we actually didn't solve the problem, but what we did is we just onboarded a person that we know. It was just our third friend. So we have all three friends, they have three friends, and we are doing the searching together and we all have the great background behind financial applications, et cetera.
00:20:59.490 - 00:21:57.650, Speaker B: It makes sense you have to basically trust them like a best friend that you've known for a long time. You can't really just bring on someone from Twitter and hope it's going to be all fine and dandy because they could share, they can sign an NDA and whatever, but that doesn't stop them from telling someone. And then that person doing something, you can't really trace it back unless you get basically access to their private dms or even if they just told them a personal over a call, it's so hard to trace. And then you can't really sue or even know if they've even told. So it's really a trust thing. And yeah, it's really critical, especially for those strategies that are high alpha and what we're building right now, which, let's say, has been in the works for months, and they just kind of leak it in any way to another team or even on Twitter on an alt account, I guess.
00:21:57.720 - 00:22:37.920, Speaker A: Yeah. I just thought we see very similar stuff in daos. Right. So there's a lot of drama in, like, when there's a lot of incentives for different entities that are inside one dow, right. But they just have competitive proposals and competitive fund spendings, and it's like all the code and all the stuff is open source, but there's still a drama if it's a problem in the open source space. So that would be even the greater problem in the closed source space.
00:22:38.370 - 00:22:50.500, Speaker B: Even like, finding new strategies. People want to leak that. But leading to that, how do you even find new strategies? Or were you just kind of like focusing on one and optimizing that until you're kind of like the best?
00:22:51.430 - 00:23:52.920, Speaker A: Yeah. So our approach, I think it's similar to the most top 1% teams. I think their approach is similar, is doing an automated way for finding stuff. So the soul searchers and I saw, I think I saw podcasts with soul searchers, and they were talking about almost like constant grifting for new opportunities. So they just constantly watch the chain and they just see very niche, long tail opportunities, and they just execute them for like one week, and they wait for other opportunities for half a year and they just see a new opportunity. They just exploited for one more week and just leave off these returns for the next half a year, something like so. And they just do that in parallel to their main job.
00:23:52.920 - 00:25:29.234, Speaker A: It's almost like a hobby for them. So if you are doing searching full time, especially in a team, and they have to make constant, stable returns. So it's viable to just set the automated way for finding new protocols and pools, and you'll not be able to exploit these niche opportunities that sole surges will exploit. But what you'll do is you'll have the constant fund flow revenue stream, right? So you're just sacrificing some of the performance for the stability that you have, and you just set up a lot of filters and checks and do all this stuff to find new pools in Defi protocols, you always know. And maybe you monitor for some new protocols and contracts that are appearing on the chain, and you just add the interfaces to these contracts to be included in your ology automated system, and you'll just check if it is included properly and added in your graph of pools that you are searching. This is the way we doing it. And I think most teams that are doing it full time have similar way of doing it, because else there's just no way of finding the strategies if you are doing full time searching.
00:25:29.282 - 00:25:45.340, Speaker B: Yeah. So you got to build some automated system, really, to just kind of. I guess the most efficient way would be like symbolic analysis. Right. And just go through every possibility. But that's also incredibly computational heavy. Right.
00:25:45.340 - 00:25:52.542, Speaker B: I guess if someone was a solo searcher, how would they even approach this if they didn't want to just mess around?
00:25:52.596 - 00:27:22.280, Speaker A: I guess that's really interesting question, because I started my Twitter account in 2021, I guess at the end of 2021, and the first mini thread I wrote is just, it's too late for solo searches to enter MeV competition. That's my first thread that got some attention from the other guys. In my opinion. It was late even back then, in the end of 2021, because there were already some cartels. It was called, like, mev cartels or something, because there was just a lot of teams that extracted mev along before flashbots, and they were really close relationships with miners, with large miners. And so these teams, they just were searching even after flashboss, and then they're switching their connections from miners to validators to large validators, and they switched their connections from miners to flashbots and et cetera. So now they have close connections to builders, and they didn't just lost their code base, right.
00:27:22.280 - 00:27:57.480, Speaker A: They still had their code base. And so the problem is not really in extracting, building a system that would be able to extract such value. Right. But the problem is in competition, because the winner gets everything or nothing. The winner gets everything, and loser got nothing in this space. So it's not like just a middle ground if your system is, like, 10% worse than everything else's, right? So you'll get nothing in return. And so that's a problem.
00:27:57.480 - 00:29:24.740, Speaker A: If you're a soul searcher, you'll spend maybe half a year for building an automated system that would just start up and would work somehow, but then you'll just figure out that you are just not competitive because your bundles will not be landing. Even if you set like 100% bribe to the proposer, it will still not land because currently the bribes are like 90% plus, I think because there's really tight competition. And especially it became more and more complex to stay competitive during the bear market because we are maybe almost two years in the bear market. All the searches, teams that started searching on chain in 2021 and starting doing it full time are still doing it today and mostly, but the market is different. So the revenues are like ten or just 100 x less that it was in the bull market. Yeah, the room for improvement. And in terms of bribes you give to the proposer is just really small and there's just no competition in there.
00:29:24.740 - 00:30:41.240, Speaker A: You cannot set the higher bribe with the worst system and just be competitive. And that's the problem for soul searchers, mostly because they have to build, not only build the working system, but the system that would be competitive with everyone else's systems. Yeah. So I don't think that the sole searcher can approach that easily, but if you will want to approach this. So one advice from me is just, you will have to figure everything out yourself. So this is the main point, I will say to everyone who will want to search because I see many people just asking someone, can you teach me, Amyv? Can you? You're just so popular and you're probably doing millions in revenue. Why wouldn't you share all your secrets and all the alpha with us? So can you please, can.
00:30:41.240 - 00:31:30.970, Speaker A: And so, yeah, I really saw a lot of people like this asking stuff on Twitter. Hopefully they were not in my dms, but in someone else's. Yeah, these people are just not going to make it. Right. So these people are just like went into crypto for easy money. But the thing is, two years of the bear market makes it impossible to get free money, even from airdrop. I saw the post yesterday that said that some guy did like 200, maybe a million volume on some exchange, on some exchange on optimism or arbitram or salana, I didn't remember.
00:31:30.970 - 00:32:06.930, Speaker A: And they just got $500 in a drop. They built this system to do the market making basically on the new decentralized exchange. Right. And they spent a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of funds for. They burned their funds for just fees, and they just got $500 in retard. So this is the current state of the market. It's really hard to enter for the newcomers.
00:32:06.930 - 00:32:17.880, Speaker A: And if you want to enter still, you have to have the mindset to figure everything out yourself, because there's friends in here.
00:32:19.130 - 00:32:43.700, Speaker B: Yeah. And everybody's trying to basically tell you the opposite of what's true, or try and play minding games with you to basically limit how fast you can get to their state or even catch up, because it's a zero sum game. And whoever basically can incentivize the miner the most gets all the money. Or let's say they have a strategy. They don't want you to kind of pick up on it and then copy them and then optimize it.
00:32:44.150 - 00:32:44.900, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:45.830 - 00:33:02.950, Speaker B: It's such a brutal PvP arena. It's kind of like hunger games, where there's only one survivor. But, yeah, I assume you guys run your own nodes, and now you've gotten into block building. Right. So how did you really get into block building? I think that's pretty interesting and quite difficult to get into initially.
00:33:03.610 - 00:33:53.430, Speaker A: Yes. So this is the interesting transition that we had. So I think that most searchers that are doing searching with flashbots have. One problem is that the current PBS design is not really optimized for the rich feedback. It is designed like, you just create a bundle, you send a bundle, the receiver of this bundle do the simple validation, right, that your transaction is actually well signed, and the bundle is not malformed and et cetera. You just do very simple checks, and it will give you a single feedback that it gives you is just hash of the bundle. So if your bundle is correct, like flashbots will give you hash of this bundle.
00:33:53.430 - 00:34:40.786, Speaker A: That's it. So you'll get no further feedback from the builder or from relay or from anyone. You just send it one way and hope it will land. And if it will not land, it's very hard to troubleshoot your system. Like why it didn't land. Maybe it wasn't really competitive with other bundles, or maybe the original targets reverted, and maybe a lot of really stuff could happen. You could have not enough gas for your transaction to execute, and you'll get no feedback, so you'll get no loss because your transactions will be included onto the chain and reverse door.
00:34:40.786 - 00:36:18.360, Speaker A: Right. But you also will get no feedback, so you will not be able to even know if your transactions have reversed during the building and they will not include it. And this is the problem that we faced especially, right, because we had a constant stream of bundles coming to the builders and we wanted to understand what's going on because at some point we just have really very little bundles that actually landed on chain for some reason and we didn't know why it happened. So our profits were like zero for several days because no bundles were included. And we just wanted to figure out what's the problem. So did we set the low bribe and lose this competition, this auction, right? Or we had some new bug in our smart contract or did we had the bug in the fees calculation or in our simulation? There's a lot of modules that can just stop working in such a system and we don't really know what was the issue and especially the blood builder, because the blood builder is a black box, actually, right, as I said. So we wanted to make our own blog builder that will give us very rich output in terms of what's going on.
00:36:18.360 - 00:37:40.238, Speaker A: Initially we wanted to simulate the block building process from the real block builders, right. And understand what's going on with our own bundles. And then we thought that if we are doing such a content system, right, if we are doing actually our own block builder to simulate other block builders, maybe it's worse, like putting it in production and make our own real block builder, right? Why not? Because it's actually the same like the model of block builder and the block builder is the same, except the real block builder is putting its blocks on. And we just built our block builder. We finalized it just maybe a month after the PBS came out and the prophetic hard folk were in. We just, we did a little bit after all the other block builders. But what we found is that we were not really quite competitive on the block builder market because our hypothesis was that we create a lot of our own order flow from intrachain arbitrage, right.
00:37:40.238 - 00:38:00.502, Speaker A: And so we can subsidize our blocks with this order flow. It was exclusive for. Right. So instead of sending to the competitive blog builders, we will send to only our blog builder and thus we will win all the blocks. Right. But it turned out that it's not enough. So it was actually very important.
00:38:00.502 - 00:38:19.062, Speaker A: So what we found is that to be competitive in the current blog building market, you have to do sandwiching. That's the first thing. It basically doubles your blog building profit from our statistical analysis. And we didn't do savaging.
00:38:19.126 - 00:38:42.658, Speaker B: Yeah, sandwiching basically is like you got double the transaction inflow, right. And even I think liquidity sniping as well, but it's not as frequent. So that's why basically the more transactions you got going into your bundle and more transaction inflow, the more share of the market you're going to have and the more frequent you're basically going to have the confirmations. Right?
00:38:42.824 - 00:39:32.082, Speaker A: Yeah. And the other thing we discovered is that I may be wrong, but if I know correctly, the current leaders in the blockbuilder market, except boss of course, are deeply tied with startup teams that are arbing Texas with Dexis. And so I think the major part of their revenue of the blood builder revenue are coming from this. So not even sandwiches, but the startup, it's really hard to also evaluate the amount of the startup of being extracted because it's like not atomic transactions. Right. You don't see all the legs of these trades, so you don't see what they're doing on success. You don't see what they're doing.
00:39:32.082 - 00:40:27.320, Speaker A: Maybe OTC even, right? And we just only see that some transaction, maybe even transfer transaction, right. If it's OTC are going on chain. But the most profit the builders are getting right now I think is from startarp. And we didn't have the connections to start harp teams at that time. We just bowsed our production of our block builder. So we just produced some blocks for a little time and we even produced the block with 300 e revenue. If I remember correctly, it was during some NFT mint and it was like probably a bug in this NFT UI that we're also doing transfer to the coinbase for some reason.
00:40:27.320 - 00:40:57.230, Speaker A: So to mint nft you should pay some eth, right, to mint. And there was probably some bug in this smart contract of this NFT that instead of doing transaction to the contract, they will do transaction to the coinbase or something like that. So the block ended up in paying like 300 e to the validators and we mined this block.
00:40:59.810 - 00:41:29.078, Speaker B: And another thing is, if someone does a front run, an exploit or any kind of exploit, basically, and they want to bribe their way with, let's say a MEP searcher is like a front runner and they do a fixed gas price or a fixed fee to basically pay for the bundle to incentivize the confirmation. If they front run a hack, they're basically giving you like 60%, for example, of a hack, which could be millions.
00:41:29.254 - 00:42:01.154, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's what we found out basically. And we had to come with some strategy that will more long term strategy, right. To become competitive in the block building market. And we had to offer something to the market, right. And adapt that other builders cannot. So what we came out with is the idea of this reach output, reach feedback from the builder that we were struggling ourselves with.
00:42:01.154 - 00:43:07.030, Speaker A: So current builders just don't give you any feedback. As I said earlier, and I talked to other searches and this was not only our problem, of course, but it's the problem of almost any searcher, or not even a searcher, but just a user who just submits their transaction to the builder for some other reason rather than searching. Right. So this is the problem. And we wanted to address it in our own builder because we did it for ourselves and we just wanted to put it in production, expose it into APIs like do the load balancing and do the 100% uptime for the rest of the market and just provide it in exchange of transactions coming directly to us. And that's what we are building basically. And our goal is to be very user friendly, developer friendly and our target audience, not like even interchange searchers.
00:43:07.030 - 00:44:07.846, Speaker A: Because I think we are covering most of the strategies right now and we are mostly targeted towards startup teams that are very used to text APIs because the text APIs are very developer friendly. That's mostly a good experience. And we want to make similar set of APIs, but for on chain because right now you have to do a lot of stuff yourself, not only run the nodes, but you have to modify these nodes and you just have to build your own set of APIs and you have to simulate everything. You have to have all the math re implemented from solidity to russ or something, right? Yeah. And it's really complicated, right. If you want to do swaps in Univ. Three or you want to do instant liquidity provision for Univ.
00:44:07.846 - 00:44:45.990, Speaker A: Three, it's really hard to evaluate everything. And so what we want to do is to make our, basically we already have everything, right? So we just use it ourselves. And what we want to do is to just expose it to everything else and just say, you can use us our APIs, but just please send your transactions to us. So we'll become more competitive on the market of the block building and we will be able to additionally subsidize our blocks with our own order flow that we are creating.
00:44:47.870 - 00:44:50.730, Speaker B: So what would your own order flow look like?
00:44:50.800 - 00:45:51.450, Speaker A: So our order flow is basically backgrounds that are going after user transactions that are uninformed order flow. So the user sends transactions to somehow we see this transaction as from transaction pool or from some private channel, but we see the transaction, we do the background and we also want to pay the user. So like the mapbutter does currently because it's an additional incentive for users to send transactions for us privately. And we want to pay the user basically, as I described, we do the arbitrage and our order flow is mostly an arbitrage, non extractive. Right. So that's beneficial to both users and both lps users and us. So, yeah, that's our private order flow we want to subsidize our blocks with.
00:45:51.450 - 00:45:56.350, Speaker A: So we would just not send it to other block builders, but exclusively to our block builder.
00:45:56.930 - 00:46:08.020, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically, when you see like a transaction and you do an arbitrage, you're basically subsidizing them and paying them for basically. Thank you for this opportunity. Here's a little cut.
00:46:08.630 - 00:46:47.374, Speaker A: Yeah, not even a little cut, but we are planning to give maybe 50% or maybe even more to the user. Yeah. Because we just cut a lot of intermediaries. Right. And we don't have to pay everything to the validator, because if the transaction, because currently the transaction that came to the transaction pool is seen by everyone and the auction is basically that there's a competition in terms of bribes paid to the validator. Right. So 95% of the bribe is going to validator, but when your transaction is private, it is private to you.
00:46:47.374 - 00:47:05.990, Speaker A: You don't have to pay any bribe to the validator. Right. You can pay everything to the user back to the user. We are saving 100% of the bribe mostly, and we just split it in half and we just pay half to ourselves and half to the user, I think. Fair deal.
00:47:06.060 - 00:47:32.000, Speaker B: Yeah. How did you even get into basically block building? Sorry, not that question. Basically, if you were to get back into block building from scratch, where you didn't know anything about block building or even like node creation, how would you even approach that now, knowing what you know now, how would you accelerate that sort of a process?
00:47:33.650 - 00:48:23.418, Speaker A: I don't think it's really that easy. At the same point, as I said, in terms of searching. Yeah. But technically it's much more easy right now because Flashbus did open source all their stuff, and you basically can just copy paste the code and run your own builder for free. And this actually, it will even receive bundles and et cetera. So you just have to set up the middleware and maybe it's centrinodes, et cetera, and the database and just run it so it's very complete. Because when we did it, we built our builder, we coded out our builder, there wasn't any reference.
00:48:23.418 - 00:49:26.254, Speaker A: And currently there's flashboss, open source builder code and everything called bid upon it. That's how actually one can get started in blob building. But as I said, it's really hard to be competitive. You should have some connections to someone who has order flow, like private order flow, to subsidize your blocks. And unfortunately you'll have to accept also this extractive toxic order flow like sandwiches because unfortunately in the current auction you will not be competitive without it. And that's what Yuri Klarman from black Trout were saying, basically, is that it's actually a great problem because there's just no way you can accept these toxic bundles. Yeah, this how the current PBS auction is designed.
00:49:26.254 - 00:49:30.354, Speaker A: And that's one of the many flaws of it.
00:49:30.552 - 00:49:48.750, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a big one. It's basically accepting detrimental transactions to users. But if you don't accept that someone else's, and then you're not going to get transaction flow. Right. So it's just going to always get on chain, I guess. What does a day in a life look like for you when doing block.
00:49:48.770 - 00:49:53.020, Speaker A: Building and Mev day in life, like in the real life?
00:49:54.110 - 00:50:00.090, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you structure your day so you can kind of juggle everything and keep up with competition?
00:50:01.810 - 00:51:16.198, Speaker A: That's a really painful question, leah, because I don't know, you might be seeing a lot of youtubers doing their videos about their day in life and they're called like day in life of the Facebook coder or day in life of the Google coder. And basically it's like an ideal life where you just stay awake and you just drink the coffee, go to the gym, and then it's like a life of a superman, basically. I think in reality, reality is pretty much different. And so my reality is mostly just normal life, but it's not really normal. It's worse than normal because if you are doing any sort of startup, I think all startups know this, that if you do any sort of startup and you're wearing all the hats possible, you have to work not even twice as much as like normal coder. Right. So you should be aware of everything's going on like twenty four seven, right.
00:51:16.198 - 00:52:04.850, Speaker A: And it doesn't give you any room for personal life. You're basically sacrificing your life and your young years, like your best years in your life, you're sacrificing them for your performance. And that's actually my case too. So what I do is mostly sit on the computer and coding or thinking about coding. Then I monitor Twitter for some news hacks, protocols, dramas, et cetera. So that's a day in life of a normal Internet user, basically, except that I'm coding a lot.
00:52:05.000 - 00:52:05.700, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:06.710 - 00:52:09.320, Speaker A: So there's not really much to brag about.
00:52:09.930 - 00:53:06.040, Speaker B: It's really like that you've got to basically be hands on all the time and sacrifice personal life for basically your career, right. Because if you're not going to do it, someone else is going to do it. And the only way you can kind of keep up with performance and optimization and even competition. So it is brutal, but it's like a necessary evil. And if it all turns out well, then it's somewhat worth it, I guess, in the future because then you've just kind of sacrificed short term partying and I don't know, like healthy lifestyle for future success and then you live the rest of your life with less worries financially if it all turns out well. But you've also got the experience of doing the startup and you can spend the rest of your life with I guess, your loved ones and whatnot. But if it doesn't turn out, then you just get experience and then you just move on to the next one until it works, right?
00:53:07.290 - 00:53:36.098, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's all about the perception of life and also the risks involved. Right? So as and everything. If the experience that you get in the most negative case is worth it, so then you just go for it. Right. And I think it's also very tied to all the responsibilities you have as a person in your life. So if you like, for example, that's why I don't recommend going searching for most people, right.
00:53:36.098 - 00:54:26.706, Speaker A: Because if they're not 18 or like 20 years old, they already might have a family to care about, right. So they have already have a personal life and they just don't have to sacrifice it because they already have a good life and there just should be improving it. Right. So they shouldn't break everything and go in the woods with your laptop and starting your own tertiary bot from scratch. Yeah, because you have something to lose, right. But if you're like a young person, young, ambitious, and you understand that parents may take care of you if all goes wrong, right. And you have no responsibilities, so that actually might be worth it.
00:54:26.706 - 00:54:50.300, Speaker A: So you're young and hungry, so that's what you are doing. Like you do some sort of startup. But I don't think searching is a popular thing right now. Everyone's pivoting to AI. Actually, I think most young and hungry persons will do their own wrapper around gt four.
00:54:52.990 - 00:55:48.220, Speaker B: Yeah, it seems pretty common right now. And I totally agree with if you have less responsibilities, you should definitely be trying to maximize risk as long as you can keep your head above water, because if you're not taking the risks early, then you won't be able to take the risk later when you have more responsibilities, I guess, with family and trying to keep basically a healthy lifestyle with friends and whatnot. Because that's kind of like life is kind of about, in my eyes, at least without friends, it gets kind of boring, right? But, yeah, I think this has been quite an interesting talk, and it's been a pleasure to have you on, and I'm very thankful. We've got to have this chance to chat and create a connection, and I hope a lot the people listening, if there are people listening, enjoy this talk as well. Very insightful from an experienced sort of Mev searcher as yourself.
00:55:49.950 - 00:56:10.974, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for the inviting me, and I really enjoyed our conversation as well. And to talk about it and to let people know how it is to be a searcher and what struggles, reality and search and have. That's basically it. Yeah. Thank you, guys.
00:56:11.012 - 00:56:22.600, Speaker B: Yeah, next time we definitely got to talk about the war stories of past experiences, but that's for another episode, so definitely have you back on. But until then, take care.
00:56:23.050 - 00:56:24.740, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. You do.
