00:00:00.330 - 00:00:21.178, Speaker A: Everyone wants to sell the token rewards, which dumps the token onto your liquidity, which means your lp position keeps losing a lot of money and maybe more money than you were ever gaining by getting your rewards and dumping them. There are some questions to these models, but that same ethos that there will be this ecosystem and ways for everyone to participate, hopefully we can find ways to make it survive and make it even more sustainable.

Maximize your eth staking value with me v exclusively on MeV IO and composable execute any intent on any chain. Coming soon to mantis app. That's M-A-N-T-I-S-A-P GMGM. Everyone, my name's Degachi, the host of scraping bits today. I'm with Cassandra from Maracas.
00:00:52.294 - 00:00:53.162, Speaker B: How's it going?
00:00:53.296 - 00:00:55.726, Speaker A: Hey there. Going good. Excited to be here.
00:00:55.828 - 00:01:01.486, Speaker B: Excited to have you on. And just for the people that aren't too familiar with you, who are you and what do you do?
00:01:01.588 - 00:01:33.798, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm Cassandra E. I'm the CTO of Arrakis Finance, which is this DFI protocol built on top of decentralized exchanges, specifically uniswap v three right now, where we basically help everyone who's trying to provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges on chain in different ways. So those can be protocols, retail liquidity providers, different kinds of sophisticated actors, but trying to build something that people can use to provide liquidity in a more optimal way and sort of harness the tools of onchain liquidity provision.
00:01:33.894 - 00:01:54.340, Speaker B: I think that's really important for V three and beyond because it's just becoming exponentially more complex versus V two. Like V two, you could just throw in liquidity and forget about it until next year. But V three is on the ranges. That's the core thing. And then V four has the hooks and whatnot. So tell us about that. How do you automate this kind of stuff?
00:01:54.790 - 00:02:20.438, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. And I like your framing. I think it's always really interesting to remember. I think it's really important, actually, that univ two came first, because that really was the one that created the dream of anybody can be a market maker, right? The liquidity in the market can be sourced from anywhere. And this design was actually very approachable. Right. It really did allow anybody to participate.
00:02:20.438 - 00:03:07.494, Speaker A: If we had realized that we needed to jump to v three right away, maybe that dream never would have become as metabolized across the crypto ecosystem, right? And instead it would have always only been specialized actors. But because that came first turns out like it was wildly inefficient, or at least we know it sort of needs to improve and thus complexify. And then maybe even it does make itself better for these more specialized actors because we got that dream at the beginning. I think that'll be really important for at least the next five years of how we try to build things like amms that make that dream, keep that dream at least alive in certain ways. So, yeah, with VR, product was really built right after V two. When V three launched, this seemed like a watershed moment. In fact, at the time I thought like, okay, this is it.
00:03:07.494 - 00:03:44.754, Speaker A: This was the watershed moment. Now with V four coming out, you realize that maybe this is even a bigger leap in terms of complexity changes to how the sort of market structure of amms. But anyway, V three already felt like a massive change. And I could tell that they weren't doing it for no reason because they were making it way more complicated. But the things that they were touting of way better capital, efficiency and so on. And you could at least notice, right, that if you can have these ranges that for things like stable coins, Univ pools made no sense whatsoever, right? Because why would you have liquidity when one die equals 15,000 USDC, right? It just makes no sense.
00:03:44.792 - 00:03:47.540, Speaker B: Well, it's what deep hex like it's done a couple of times.
00:03:48.790 - 00:04:25.282, Speaker A: True, of course, right? These things aren't actually fully stable all the time, but still, right. That opened up the opportunity for, I don't know, I guess a curve, right, came in and filled that niche because uniswap pools didn't work for everything. They certainly didn't work for that. So V three was like a really exciting, interesting development that I was pumped about. And I think the issue then, of course, is exactly. It makes the liquidity provider's job changes fundamentally, even just with this slight addition of not that many choices. But now you can pick a price range and liquidity is not as democratized, right.
00:04:25.282 - 00:05:09.406, Speaker A: Because we used to all take a share of all the volume and everybody had to run the exact same liquidity provision strategy. The only choice you had was when to provide the liquidity and when to remove it. Now, just by adding one more choice that you can put a range on your liquidity. Actually everything changed. And us as liquidity providers are now PVP against each other, where you want to be more concentrated than the other, to pick up more of the fees and so on. And you have to make all these choices and then you might have to adjust these choices because you might pick a price range and pick a price range that makes a lot of sense for the prices today and would help you to capture a lot of fees in the market because it's highly concentrated. And then of course, regimes change, prices move.
00:05:09.406 - 00:06:19.446, Speaker A: And then you need to decide, do I want to rebalance my inventory and eat some losses to provide deep liquidity around this new price range at this new regime? Or should I have had a wider range to begin with? Or when I notice the market moving, should I make my range much less concentrated in order to avoid the sort of losses I'm taking to the more informed participants who know the price needs to move in that direction? All of these questions make it just way, way more complicated for a liquidity provider, even just moving from v two to v three. And so in this ethos of can we still keep an Amm world alive where anyone can feel confident to provide liquidity to this new exchange, which has many more complicated choices for people and dows and everyone who might be providing liquidity in the v two setting, can we keep that dream alive somehow? And the idea that we had in Aracus is basically to, and it comes straight from, by the way, the Univ. Three kind of the first documents they came out with, they pointed right to this. There's like a sentence in there where they say, and Univ. Three positions could be tokenized at the periphery. And I basically read that before Univ. Three even came out.
00:06:19.446 - 00:07:50.258, Speaker A: And I thought, yeah, let's do this. Let's create a wrapper around Univ. Three where people can deposit liquidity into this wrapper and they'll get back a fungible token, and they can basically subscribe themselves to one specific liquidity strategy. Since now your liquidity providing actually needs to have a strategy where you might either have a full range and then you don't need to do anything, but you might also have tighter, more concentrated ranges that you might want to update for different reasons. And could we create this standard, this vault standard, where you get back to having the fungible liquidity, and for those actually providing the inventory, it goes back to this simple Univ two like experience where you just provide the liquidity and you earn your share of the fees and of the profits, but then have sort of a platform where it's possible to encode exactly what the rules might be of these different liquidity strategies. And what are the trust assumptions there? Who can manage it? Or is it entirely on chain and create like a whole potential ecosystem for this? So that's really where we came from, was really just reading the Univ three white paper and noticing that there was going to be major complexity there and deciding to do something about it. And because at that time, everyone was so excited about V three, we were hit with really organic demand right away because it turned out that dows actually, right, dows and do have a protocol and liquidity, and people issuing a new token, they wanted to put liquidity on chain on Uniswap, but now they were like, oh, but wait, what price range should I pick? Is it good? And so on.
00:07:50.258 - 00:07:52.110, Speaker A: So we were able to fill that hole.
00:07:52.190 - 00:08:36.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think a lot of people would even know about what price range to do, unless I guess they had a price range in mind and like a presale. But I guess if it's open market, what do you even choose? You're like, oh, I think this one. But then a bunch of people buy, and then it's broken out of that range by maybe tenfold. And you're like, oh, well, shit, how do you even do it? And I think the math behind v three is marginally more complex than v two. And maybe people don't have the skills behind that. I know I don't. I'm not a math head, so I think someone made a book on it, on explaining everything in v three, and that's how I kind of learnt it, but not to the intuitive level of understanding everything behind it, but at least working in a test, and I can just kind of play around with it, given the formulas, I guess.
00:08:36.910 - 00:09:12.282, Speaker B: But a lot of people don't know that and maybe don't have the time to do that, especially if they're running a protocol, because protocol in itself is hard enough. They don't want to focus on learning math for one specific thing. They want to build the actual thing. And so I love the aspect of the PVP element that is introduced with vfree because it's ranges. Now, there's one variable that determines basically how much fees you get rather than everyone chuck in the most amount of money you have. You can be less capitalized and actually do better than someone with a shit ton of money as long as you know what you're doing. Well, to a degree, I think, yeah, for sure.
00:09:12.336 - 00:10:01.802, Speaker A: In theory it's possible, right? In practice, I agree with you. Yeah, probably the more money you have, the more you're realizing you need to be a little more sophisticated about how you might distribute that liquidity. But in theory, and you do see it all the time in uniswap, at least in short timeframes. Where one actor with not that many funds, but just with all their liquidity in, let's say one tick is for a little while absolutely dominating the fees, taking all the fees, essentially. And this happens routinely. One reason is because people use uniswap p three as a limit order, a place to kind of have this sort of very rough limit order like experience where you just put in one sided liquidity and then you wait for it to get fully crossed and then you remove it. The reason it's not really like a limit order is you actually have to do this active action to remove it.
00:10:01.802 - 00:10:27.890, Speaker A: But a lot of people actually do place these limit orders. Sometimes you can see them in the book and like a really tall spike in the ETh USDC market, like 15% up or down or something. And that's definitely someone who's really just very likely using it like a limit order, but with the benefit of at the time, while it's actually churning through that specific tick, then the lion's share and there might be 200 million in the pool, but they're getting all the fees for that day or that time frame.
00:10:28.050 - 00:10:33.666, Speaker B: And even just mev strategies of JiT just works. I mean, that introduced that strategy.
00:10:33.778 - 00:10:37.222, Speaker A: Yeah. That this completely didn't exist pre univ three.
00:10:37.276 - 00:10:59.054, Speaker B: Yeah. And I wonder what v four will introduce, especially with Unisop X as well, the limit orders. And I think they probably using account abstraction for it. How do you really automatically determine these ranges and shift and rebalance? Because obviously there's so many pools. Right. So I assume you're not covering all of these pools, however many tens of thousands there are. So what is kind of the process of doing this?
00:10:59.252 - 00:11:52.350, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question, I think. So when we started we were really optimistic and uv three didn't even exist yet, and nobody really understood these concepts that well yet. Nowadays it's starting to look more and more like merging with the traditional financial world's ideas around liquidity and how order books work and so on. But at that time, because Univ two was the model, everybody thought lping was like its own universe, totally as still kind of very sectioned off from traditional financial thinking and markets and so on. And so nobody had that much of a clue. And we at least were pretty naive at the very, very beginning thinking, for instance, that just by keeping a very concentrated range and just keeping updated to keep following the price and rebalancing to move there, that was like our first experiment on Eth die or something. And we thought that, oh, maybe we're just going to print money and it's going to be amazing.
00:11:52.350 - 00:12:31.098, Speaker A: And you realize very quickly that we were very quickly losing money and we went, oh, okay. This range rebalancing is a really hard problem because of the fact that in order to get yourself back in range, if you're very concentrated, your assets turn over very quickly and then you have to buy back in in order to get back in range. And if the price is highly volatile, right. If you can get very chopped up in the market, right, the price skyrockets up. Now you have to buy really high, buy back in really high in order to provide liquidity there. Then it shoots way down, then you have to sell low to buy back in. And now you're buying high and selling low and you're losing money.
00:12:31.184 - 00:12:36.480, Speaker B: LP, how did you start this out? Were you just doing one, just seeing, experimenting with that?
00:12:37.010 - 00:13:36.070, Speaker A: Yeah, first there was internal experiments with LP and we realized, wow, these volatile markets, this is going to be really complex, right? It's not just have basic pieces that you want to be very concentrated and it's going to work and that you automate it and it's going to work. No. So what we did actually is first we realized that the tokenization was still very, very useful, and so we made the problem easier. And we started with stablecoin pairs, actually, right? Because here you can provide a very, very concentrated range that basically never has to change, or maybe only a little bit should change every so often. So constrained the problem at first to something easier, because we realized that for very volatile markets, it was going to be a very hard problem. So, like, stablecoins is one place that we were able to really innovate at the very beginning and provide a lot of value, just because it was way more composable and integratable, because you'd have a fungible LP token again. So you could do things like liquidity mining on top really easily, or use this LP as collateral, which we did with Makerdao for DaiUsDC.
00:13:36.070 - 00:13:44.018, Speaker A: And so just adding that composability was useful, even though the strategy was basically nothing. It's either static or very simple.
00:13:44.104 - 00:13:47.198, Speaker B: Like, everyone would do the same if it's just a stable coin pair.
00:13:47.294 - 00:14:53.070, Speaker A: Yeah. In general, actually, for liquidity mining, it's quite helpful because the liquidity mining on top of v three, when you make it more about like only when you're in range, do you earn the liquidity mining rewards. And for everybody can have their own range. The issue is it gets dominated by these jit jit like players or people kind of game it and it doesn't get what you want, which is like really sustainable deep liquidity over a long period because people will go in with super concentrated liquidity for very short time frames to lap up a lot of rewards. And so what our thing also unlocked, even if it was, let's say just like a static, very wide range, but you could incentivize, a project could choose to incentivize a particular range that they thought was sort of good for the market and fair or whatever. And then all the lps could earn the liquidity mining rewards by subscribing themselves to that range, let's say, even if it doesn't even move. So not very sophisticated nowadays, we had to build a whole second version of infrastructure to feel comfortable building strategies that would actually active strategies that would outperform something boring and simple for volatile markets.
00:14:53.070 - 00:15:26.318, Speaker A: Now we finally have that. And so you can even do liquidity mining on top of some designated strategy. But in my view, all of these things work way better than the sort of liquidity mining by who's in range, because you democratize it. Again, everyone earns together the same and thus the project can get more of what they're targeting, what they want. Like I want liquidity like this. So this will autonomously run a liquidity provision strategy, like so. And then anyone who feels like pledging their funds to that can earn rewards, but all of them in lockstep, right? Just based on how much prorata.
00:15:26.318 - 00:16:22.978, Speaker A: So these were the things we tackled at first to avoid the complexities of the active management. Nowadays, the things you have to look into to active manage correctly are a couple of different things that are at your disposal, which is having multiple ranges is very, very helpful. Like having asymmetric liquidity, right? So maybe it's more concentrated on one side of the market than on the other. And in general, you might make these distribution type shapes that make more sense for your kind of estimation of the volatility and how this particular market moves around. Volatility is very, very important, right? So like sort of table stakes for making markets in general is that you need to thin the book when volatility starts spiking because you don't want to expose your inventory at the wrong price. And if the prices are moving around very quickly, then one way to just get more conservative is provide less size around any given price. So being reactive to changes in volatility.
00:16:22.978 - 00:17:10.742, Speaker A: So get more concentrated when you're in a very, very low volatility setting and less concentrated when you're in. High volatility can help a lot as well. And then finally, we use kind of these limit order techniques where you can create artificially create bigger spreads because you place an order 2% off the market. If you place some liquidity 2% above the current price and 2% below, and then you think of them as limit orders. So if it gets filled, you remove it on one side and then the other side gets filled and you remove that. Then now you're making a spread like a traditional order book kind of market maker, right? And that spread is whatever, two or 4% that you just made there, which doesn't have to do with the fee. Usually when you think of amms, we think of the spread as the fee, right.
00:17:10.742 - 00:17:27.110, Speaker A: But now you can take a 2% spread on a 0.1% fee tier if you want, by executing such a liquidity provision strategy. So these are some of the domains that we look into today while we're trying to make strategies that are actually competitive on volatile markets.
00:17:27.190 - 00:18:16.666, Speaker B: When I think about these ranges and you have a concentrated liquidity for what you think is the average of the day or the week, but the inherent risk of, you know, sandwiching, like let's say Jared or something. If Jared had his own JIT strategy combined, he's basically targeting every single normal swap. And within that swap you could just do JIT before the entire kill chain, quote unquote, like top bread, the meat and then the bottom of the bread for the sandwich. But you can encase that within a jit. And then if you have enough capital, all these people that are providing liquidity, they're kind of there. They don't get any fees if they have enough money to just it, for sure.
00:18:16.768 - 00:18:37.118, Speaker A: Right. The providers, it's a really big problem. If JIT were to become gigantic, it's quite interesting that it didn't become that huge yet. There's not that much jit inside the uniswap, different markets, surprisingly little. Right. For how much is talked about. Actually, though, maybe it will keep growing.
00:18:37.118 - 00:18:55.590, Speaker A: But yeah, it's a huge problem because not only do you basically never get any fees if you're always getting JIT whenever real order, big orders come through, but you're exposing yourself to the stale price and then your inventory moving. Right. So you're taking away all the gains and you're still taking this massive risk of inventory.
00:18:56.010 - 00:19:24.174, Speaker B: I think a solution to that would be a time variable of entry, of put in x amount of money today. And you wait a week and someone does a jit in a week's time for the exact same range, but with like, let's say 100 mil or something, you have the time variable, and so it might scale for you because you've been there longer. That might work, but I don't know, the repercussions are just kind of a first initial thought of how to counter it.
00:19:24.212 - 00:20:10.190, Speaker A: Well, you can certainly write, you could add Jit protection into uniswap b four hook for sure, right. By enforcing that, all lps need to make a certain time commitment. This is one way to make jit impossible, right, is you add a rule that you can't provide liquidity and then remove it in the same block or something. Though I don't love this, actually, because this is something we do a lot at Arrakis. Not on purpose, not because we're doing JIT, but because sometimes when we rebalance our positions, we'll remove a bunch of positions and then place new ones all in one big transaction, which I guess, depending on how you make the JIT protection, you might over discriminate for stuff like us, which isn't actually manipulating at that. Using it as a jit tactic. Exactly.
00:20:10.190 - 00:20:14.714, Speaker A: But it is just trying to reposition its liquidity efficiently in one transaction.
00:20:14.842 - 00:20:57.786, Speaker B: Interesting. And we talked about the stablecoin ranges, but when you think about volatile scenarios, like in a bull market, for example, the food coin craze, where there was just like tons of people going to yam finance, and all these rebalance tokens where they'll auto adjust every 24 hours, just massive shifts in price. And obviously there was v free back then. It would be a giant game, and I hope there would be another food craze, because v free would be very interesting in that kind of condition. And it would be quite a big strategy, I think, especially for anyone really, like vault managers, even Jit would be giant, because trading like hundreds of millions.
00:20:57.978 - 00:21:03.038, Speaker A: And another bull market in some. I don't know if food tokens are coming back, right?
00:21:03.124 - 00:21:06.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think so. But that was like the master chef innovation.
00:21:07.830 - 00:22:03.326, Speaker A: Exactly. Liquidity mining. Right. And that's what's cool too, right? Liquidity mining, which is also maybe a thesis that who knows if it'll live forever. But this was a huge unlock in terms of people actually participating, wasn't only that anyone could provide liquidity, but also there were these systems and these new tokens that were inflating and so on that would actually incentivize you to make the markets deeper. And then these markets were actually uniswap b two markets were actually getting quite deep, even though they weren't that efficient because of all these interesting games that were being created on top. And all of this time period, I think it was so important for, again, this ethos of that it is possible to have a very super permissionless ecosystem and environment that's creating these deep markets where anyone can trade, but that's actually being sourced from any sort of participant anywhere through all these different financial games of we'll give you a reward and liquidity mining.
00:22:03.326 - 00:22:55.714, Speaker A: And I think hopefully something of this spirit definitely lives on. It just needs to become a bit more adult and complex or something, because of course a lot of liquidity mining looks a bit like it ended up being a way to lure people into providing liquidity without knowing what they were doing. And then you get this token. If the token dumps, right, the classic thing is some sort of death spiral where everyone wants to sell the token rewards, which dumps the token onto your liquidity, which means actually your lp position keeps losing a lot of money and maybe more money than you were ever gaining by getting your rewards and dumping them. And so there are some questions to these models, but that same ethos that there will be this ecosystem and ways for everyone to participate, I think hopefully we can find ways to make it survive and make it even actually a little bit more sustainable.
00:22:55.762 - 00:23:05.750, Speaker B: I guess the only time I ever provided liquidity was during that food, that food craze. And that's because the apys were so high for providing liquidity.
00:23:06.650 - 00:23:07.702, Speaker A: The rewards, right?
00:23:07.756 - 00:23:46.070, Speaker B: Some incentives, but without the incentives, the risk versus reward doesn't seem to align. So I've never really done it beyond them in terms of, you have the inherent risk of everything moving the underlying token. So if you're doing like ETH and token a, you really just want eth. So you're taking this risk of holding token a and the price might change. Well, high likelihood of changing to not what you want. Like 90% of tokens are kind of useless. And so if you're doing that, plus the fees you get, if someone's like JT or you just don't have a lot of money, then you're probably not going to make a lot.
00:23:46.070 - 00:23:52.454, Speaker B: And loss is just. No, man. It's usually a better bet to just hold the eth instead.
00:23:52.652 - 00:23:55.398, Speaker A: Absolutely right, absolutely.
00:23:55.564 - 00:24:04.870, Speaker B: So why would someone want to even jump into LP nowadays, at least if there's just so much downside versus upside?
00:24:05.030 - 00:25:22.894, Speaker A: I mean, it's a great question, right? And then we add into this, I think this is what we analyze and talk about all the time is like, will there even really legitimately be a space for this? Or was this ethos only naivete? Right? And it really doesn't make sense because the risk reward for making markets in general is really difficult, right? That's why it's these highly specialized actors who end up doing it in the traditional financial world is because there's a lot of risks and they're difficult to understand and quantify and hedge and so on. And the rewards are kind of, they're good, but it's often a little spread on top of everything. It's kind of collecting a small reward all the time, right? With massive risks. This is the domain of market making, and it's why who does it. These super sophisticated hedge in the traditional world, right? These super sophisticated hedge funds who know how to fully, perfectly hedge these positions so that they know they're not going to lose to a big move in the underlying, or at least not too bad. And they can just collect on the spreads that they're making, facilitating a lot of trading. But the idea that you and I, and anybody and someone who just started a project who now also needs to become some liquidity manager can become this specialized actor is, yeah, potentially questionable, right? It's really going to work because it's super confusing.
00:25:22.894 - 00:26:09.118, Speaker A: And actually, even today, you have to add into this that just the structure of the amm itself is making most liquidity providers lose money because of the toxic flow that you take on, isn't compensated well enough by the fees. And when you look at, especially when we got to v three and you could have many fee tiers and everybody wanted to get a lot of volume. So we've really been super aggressive in terms of the way that the fees have been driven down for lps. The biggest pool is 0.5 for ETH USDC. And I think Uniswap, my guess, if you look at when it started, they were really thinking that ETH, USDC and classic major volatile pair would live on the 0.3% fee tier.
00:26:09.118 - 00:26:45.274, Speaker A: And I think that's because lps actually are getting undercompensated on the 0.5% fee tier. Here's a great example why Uniswap is now charging 15 bips on the front end just to use it. I don't know if you saw this, right? Uniswap just released that. Now they're starting to. You can use Uniswap permissionlessly, but if you use the front end, then on certain tokens like ETH, you actually pay a 15 basis point fee directly to Uniswap labs, not to the lps. So they're willing to put a 15 basis point fee on there, but the lps only take five, and the lps actually take on the underlying risk.
00:26:45.274 - 00:27:48.398, Speaker A: This shows that lps are probably being too greedy for volumes and not actually paying enough attention to the risks they're taking on and or basically are being undercompensated. Right. If people still want to trade ETH and they're willing to add 15 bips, no problem, just because it's convenient and they like the pink front end, then probably we should be charging at least 15 bip ourselves to be the ones who have the assets that they trade against, right? Yeah, I mean, it's definitely really questionable. I think mainly your view is actually the same as real world market makers, crypto market makers like winter mute, right. They don't provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges yet, because they don't see it as the risk reward profile being good for them yet. Maybe that'll change now as the AM get more sophisticated. But basically, the biggest problem is not only are these all these complexities we talked about, but there's also these slow block times, right, and prices move in the real world, but then they don't move on the block.
00:27:48.398 - 00:28:31.966, Speaker A: And that means you open yourself to top of block, like on a liquid market like ETH, USDC, there's just top of block arbitrage that just leaks every block to the arbitragers. And this is what we call loss versus rebalancing. Right. And this is just a running cost for providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges on an amm, right, that you wouldn't even have. Like, it's already super complex and sort of scary to provide liquidity to any market, to be a market maker. But now if you want to be an on chain market maker, you also have to add this super severe running cost that you just can't get around right now until we make the amms better. So in general, your view is the right view, which is, should you be providing liquidity? Oftentimes, probably not.
00:28:31.966 - 00:29:03.466, Speaker A: And why does Arrakis still sort of thrive and exist? Well, because getting liquidity on chain is so valuable for other reasons, for composability, for, like, if you want to be a collateral token and you need to do liquidations, all these different things, for these permissionless projects and ecosystems where they want anyone to be able to go in and out of their token, there's so much value that people are willing to spend and lose money in order to have deep on chain liquidity for now until things get better. Feel like this is really all Arrakis can do is make it as good.
00:29:03.488 - 00:29:21.486, Speaker B: As possible, but still pretty not good. Yeah, I think majority of probably liquidity is naive or know a large player knows what they're doing, has a kind of plan, but still, I don't know for the small player, it just makes zero sense to do.
00:29:21.668 - 00:29:22.400, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:29:23.010 - 00:29:28.498, Speaker B: But what do you think b four is going to do to kind of change this field as well?
00:29:28.664 - 00:29:38.194, Speaker A: So I think there's a lot of talk though. Basically the classic line would be we need to solve this loss versus rebalancing lever or LVR.
00:29:38.322 - 00:29:39.542, Speaker B: The top of block thing.
00:29:39.676 - 00:30:10.106, Speaker A: Yeah. This top of block problem, this running cost that amms constantly have, where informed people always get to get a better price, often against you just because the system is too rigid. So people are really working on that top of block issue for sure. For the highly liquid markets, it's not as important for other long tail markets though, right? If they don't have off chain prices and so on. Right. If it's the main liquidity source is uniswap, that changes things already there. And if you're on a higher fee tier.
00:30:10.106 - 00:30:32.454, Speaker A: Right. This also makes that less of the most important thing. So I've heard the classic answer is we need to build hooks and so on that will solve these structural problems. Like mainly LVR is what people talk about. But really I'd say more than that. To make it more general, you need to add functionality into the decks that increases the makes, helps the lps make more money. Right.
00:30:32.454 - 00:31:01.454, Speaker A: The profitability for the lps in general, that's the big problem. Like you say, nobody knows why, but even Dan Robinson from Uniswap has been heard on podcasts and so on. To say it's this big question that nobody really knows, which is like, who is providing all that eth, USDC liquidity that everybody is on Twitter all the time being like it's losing so much money, why is it there, right? And it's still don't even. Uniswap doesn't even know why. So it's a big interesting question.
00:31:01.572 - 00:31:36.202, Speaker B: Maybe it's just some big player that doesn't know what to do with their money and that's the only, you know, an alternative to that would be sold eth. But at that point, Ethereum wouldn't even thrive because everything is built on these tokens that people trade. So it's like you kind of need liquidity for everything to work. So maybe some giant player is like, okay, we have a ton of this token. We need the ecosystem to survive, and the only way it survives is us providing liquidity. And maybe if you're in it long enough, maybe all these downsides aren't really a downside. It kind of equals out.
00:31:36.202 - 00:31:38.842, Speaker B: But yeah, I haven't done the map on that.
00:31:38.976 - 00:32:46.798, Speaker A: General this is really definitely one of the main segments, right? Because think about if you're a token issuer, you created a project, you're willing to pay a cost for this market to be more liquid and people to be able to trade it on chain without the price moving insanely all the time, or just not even know how to trade it on chain. And you're okay with maybe losing good amount of money there, especially losing money where you lose the opportunity cost of holding your own token if it goes up, right? Because technically you'd lose money, but it's like it's your token. So probably you already have a lot of those tokens anyway. So this kind of limits already some of the price moving kind of risks you have as an LP because you lose out on some upside if you sell a lot as the price goes up. But you have this other position, right? Just spot holding a bunch of the tokens that should make it so you were willing to lose something to opportunity costs there to make the market liquid, and you didn't lose everything because you already have a ton and might even be the same. You can imagine the same for ETH. Some giant player in the Ethereum world goes, well, Ethereum needs to succeed.
00:32:46.798 - 00:33:56.022, Speaker A: I have a gigantic eth bag, but Ethereum succeeds if uniswap is constantly used and super liquid and so on. And so I'll collect a bunch of fees, take on some risk, maybe I'll even lose money. But in general, it'll be worth it for me. Because if all of this makes the whole ethereum ecosystem worth way more, I have this other position that the rest of my eth bag that goes up to ten or whatever, and it was all still worth it. So that's why often token issuers themselves, or token issuers giving auxiliary incentives for people to put the liquidity there and then the final one for ETH USDC, right? Like who's doing that one? Because that's a little weirder, right? Who has such a big eth bag? The last way you could think who might actually have an incentive to do this would be the mev actors themselves, because they get to make a lot of money. Sandwiching everybody's trades, but only if everybody's trading. So maybe they're willing to lose some money as being the kind of base liquidity that helping to prime the pump there so that then they can backrun all these markets and sandwich things and so on and still end up kind of the whole thing being net positive for them.
00:33:56.022 - 00:33:59.338, Speaker A: This is one theory for who's actually doing it.
00:33:59.504 - 00:34:05.340, Speaker B: Maybe because I think they would use the money themselves to do like JiT, for example, or something.
00:34:06.030 - 00:34:14.874, Speaker A: Exactly. If there's not this long term big well of money in there, is anyone going to be trading on Uniswap?
00:34:14.922 - 00:34:23.680, Speaker B: I mean, it can't just be like one giant player. I think it would be maybe like an institution that would just buy a fuckload and be like, okay, what do we do with this?
00:34:24.290 - 00:34:46.120, Speaker A: My view is actually that it's actually people, there's enough people in crypto that's not this smart. There's enough people in crypto who just want to participate so badly and even maybe they have a ton of ETH in USDC and stuff, but they're still kind of naive and just like, uniswap's amazing. I want to participate, I want to play market maker and they're just not that sensitive to losing a bunch of money.
00:34:46.490 - 00:35:06.414, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I think the v four hooks will be interesting as well, with people doing their own thing and then the masses kind of deciding which one to choose. It'd be quite interesting. We also did some stuff on stealth addresses as well, and that was kind of a nerd snipe, I feel like. So how did you get into that and why did you do it?
00:35:06.532 - 00:35:46.346, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. I just read, had a blog post that was on stealth addresses, and stealth address technology is pretty old, actually, really basic cryptography in a sense. And yeah, I'd say it's like two things. I have this background in more traditional cryptography, like, not cryptocurrencies. Before I was in cryptocurrency, I was already a researcher in multiparty computation and thinking about cryptography even outside of that domain. And so I have some familiarity with public keys and elliptic curves and so on from first principles that surprisingly, a lot of developers on the applications level don't really engage with that that much because you don't have to. Right.
00:35:46.346 - 00:36:24.838, Speaker A: Ethereum extracts that away from you. You don't think about the ECDSA algorithm when you just want to transact and so on. But I have some background there and I read the blog post that came out relatively recently about stealth addresses from Vitalik just really resonated with me of is, this is elegant, and I could implement this. It's simple, it's not like building Starknet or something, which is actually very complicated. Right. This is like cryptography, that if you've taken the courses, the first course in the undergrad or whatever, and you know what's going on, it's pretty doable, tractable for even anyone as a weekend project. So I really liked this.
00:36:24.838 - 00:36:57.522, Speaker A: And I guess the last part is, yeah, I think my belief to bring it back to Uniswap. Right. Uniswap is an application that I always felt my framing of how it got built is like Vitalik made an ETH research post and then Hayden was the person smart enough to just be like, I'm just going to implement that exactly how he said it, without any frills. And then you end up with the uniswap, a very powerful thing. So my view is that whenever you see a Vitalik blog post and you go, I could just implement that. Just do it, you never know what's going to happen.
00:36:57.576 - 00:37:26.794, Speaker B: Could be the next big thing. And I think it's important as well. Like the privacy stuff, especially with ZK coming out and that kind of new wave. I thought all my wallets were private, but then I looked at Metamask and saw they were all tracking ips and I was like, oh, sick. Cool. And then I kind of went bit deeper into the infosec side of things, of, oh yeah, nodes probably track your ip and all this other stuff. So how do you kind of limit this? And then it just becomes like a classic web two cybersec problem.
00:37:26.794 - 00:38:07.670, Speaker B: But I think stealth addresses are cool, though, especially for dows, the people that want to be anonymous and do the anonymous work and get paid from a Dow, you can just get paid the wallet that actually holds the tokens, but they can see it. And I think that is quite cool as long as you don't leak it or leak your ip and anything. So, yeah, I think especially with the increasing surveillance of the world, all these wallets tracking your ip and whatnot, I think it would be kind of cool to have an open source wallet that would implement some kind of stealth address or anonymous privacy solution, privacy by default. I think a lot of people would shift over to that, actually care about it at least.
00:38:07.820 - 00:38:28.766, Speaker A: Well, that's the last reason that I did it as well, that I feel like. So, yeah, privacy is definitely a value and something that's been hard to actually get moving on chain. Even though we know that it's really necessary. Because on chain is like the most transparent place to transact today. And you have really hard to get privacy. And also where we have gotten privacy, it's been extremely politicized. Right.
00:38:28.766 - 00:38:59.990, Speaker A: And you oFac sanctioning of tornado cash and so on. So privacy is a big issue. And finally, privacy is this thing that everybody says they care about but nobody actually, in practice, people say they care about it. But then when it comes down to it, and if there's any inconvenience, they are very quick to default to. Like, okay, forget privacy. So basically it has like tragedy of the Commons type thing where it really needs to be a public good. Because if I make you pay even five cents more, you might actually go, well, then forget privacy.
00:38:59.990 - 00:39:21.598, Speaker A: And that's really bad for the whole thing. Right. Because everybody has privacy. The whole crypto ecosystem becomes the global financial sediment layer or whatever. But that can also sort of support people being private, which is very important for the financial substrates. Like why cash is so cool. So, yeah, I just feel like all of this meant that.
00:39:21.598 - 00:39:53.162, Speaker A: Why not you read this blog post, you can hack on it. And in privacy, I feel like really the things that will matter are things that are more just like open source and not thinking just about how they can capture it as a business. And this was tractable for me as a couple of weekends. I could do a project here and now. If I deployed the contracts to Ethereum mainnet, there would already be like a sort of very janky, very developer focused but credible way for you to start transacting with privacy all the time by yourself on chain. And so let's do it.
00:39:53.216 - 00:40:03.690, Speaker B: It's interesting about the tornado cache, how they sanctioned that. But then there's a whole ecosystem ZK vms coming out which would enable basically infinite tornado caches.
00:40:04.990 - 00:40:28.530, Speaker A: Remember also though, yeah, that there are two. Most of the Zkevms, they're only using zero knowledge technology to compress data. Right. So that you can provide a proof to the l one that everything happened correctly. But also it's still totally transparent. So they're only using the compression aspect of ZK. They're not actually doing the privacy.
00:40:28.530 - 00:40:43.914, Speaker A: There are a few that are actually interested in privacy. Aztec, great example. The inventors of Planck. I think that's super cool. So there are some. And probably, I bet they will eventually have some. They'll have to worry about their legal strategy and so on.
00:40:43.952 - 00:40:58.222, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be interesting. But if it's like a decentralized network, which is ZK, then how do you even shut that down? I guess you have to track every single node. But if it's just open source code, kind of like a tor node, what do you do?
00:40:58.356 - 00:41:24.418, Speaker A: Exactly. And that's why Zcash and Monero, right, they're in this more gray area where they still run, even though. But they have gotten regulatory pressure and so on. I do think it's sort of tough for them to thrive right now. So hopefully, people will get more hip to the idea that this privacy is actually good and useful. But it's a very hard sell right now when crypto is already seen as very scary and bad and so on for bad actors, and then we say we want it to be private.
00:41:24.594 - 00:41:56.782, Speaker B: Yeah, I think why regulatory is coming so hard on it is because it's so powerful, and it does actually dethrone them completely. When you think about cash, countries are getting rid of it, like Australia, for example. They literally took all the cash away. You can't really do anything in cash because you can't withdraw it anymore, or at least very minimal amounts, and there's a lot of paperwork to even withdraw it in cash. That just begs the question, why? And it's just digitalize everything. And then you ask why? Again, it's just surveillance. And what stops surveillance? Privacy.
00:41:56.782 - 00:42:57.986, Speaker B: And that's why they're shutting it all down, or regulatory processes to it. But when you go deeper into those meanings, it's such an important point in history, I think, and something that can really change the tide of normal people living versus these big constitutions and a small group of elites that can control everyone. And that's why cyber becomes even more important. And all this other stuff, cyber privacy, crypto in general, even though it's kind of a shitcoin Ponzi fest, it still has the inherent value of, I think, being an essential, like a monumental step in the right direction for financial freedom and self sovereignty. And if you don't want your money in a bank where they can just freeze it or take it all out, if the country gets into some debt, some really bad debt, or they need a reset or something, which I think they've done in the past with the gold standard and stuff, they just kind of withdrew everything. But I remember reading this when I first got into crypto. Crypto is the only thing where you can't just get rugged from the person holding everything.
00:42:57.986 - 00:43:07.474, Speaker B: If a bank goes under, I mean, GG for your money. But in crypto, the only thing really stopping is the cryptography behind it. And I guess the amount of nodes and whatnot.
00:43:07.602 - 00:43:19.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Some economic incentives as well. But even those are more dubious. Right. We're still figuring them out with proof of stake. And do the economic incentives actually hold even if we scale up tremendously? Right. And there's a lot of unknowns there.
00:43:19.514 - 00:44:29.390, Speaker A: But one thing that I think you touched on that I absolutely agree with, and it's sort of where I come from, my ethos, just cryptography itself has been a very important thing that governments have fought against every step of the way, but is just huge for human freedom. And in the 80s, just public key cryptography itself without any applications. They tried to make it military secret, and there was all this fighting with the government and they lost. And then we got an Internet with HTTPs where we could actually put our credit cards in there, and the world changed like crazy. Right? And now you utilize that same exact public key cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, and you get bitcoin and tor and things like this, which are even more intensely undermining this state power with things that are just better and less corruptible. Right. And of course, they always, every time they create also a fear of uncertainty around this really scary future that seems anonymous and, like, how is it going to be okay, and how do I know that I'm safe? And so on? Because we're so attached to, the only way to have security and safety is by sort of, like, centralized participants creating a curated environment.
00:44:29.390 - 00:44:38.582, Speaker A: But again, cryptography just unlocks a new direction, which is so incredible and fascinating, and I'm just really committed to.
00:44:38.636 - 00:45:23.300, Speaker B: And when you look at history as well, like World War II with the Germans, they were using the enigma, right? And that was, you know, when Alan Turing and the British decoded that and figured it all out, it really turned the tides of war. In today's society, the war is really not physical. It's all cyber, and you can't really see. And that's why nobody's really. You don't really understand it until you're in the game yourself. When you think about the underlying reason of, I guess, governments and cryptography, that kind of war, it's really a testament to the power behind it and why it's so important. And I think more people should definitely get into cryptography, but the learning curve is much harder than just being able to fuck around, find out with a random project.
00:45:24.150 - 00:46:21.874, Speaker A: Oh, for sure. And that's, again, why we have to abstract these things and make them have a nice ux. And so when I think about this stealth addresses stuff like, what would I love to see it's totally some kind of browser based, I would be so cool to see a browser based wallet where you have public address and your ens name cassandra eth. And one of the sort of records for that ens cassandra eth name is your stealth meta address, which is the thing that allows you to give me private payments without anyone knowing that you're paying me, and also without coordinating with me. This wallet would sort of handle these stealth addresses under the hood on your behalf, so that you as a user wouldn't even know that you're having these privacy guarantees, and even that you have multiple addresses, kind of like how in bitcoin you usually don't reuse addresses. So your wallet was an abstraction. You have a coin in a lot of little addresses, a lot of utxos, but you see it as just one balance.
00:46:21.874 - 00:47:56.994, Speaker A: You could have the same thing here in your I can think of it as, oh, this is just me opening my cassandra eth wallet, but inside it are actually all these received payments sitting in all these untouched addresses that give me this privacy, even though I can see it perfectly well. And whenever I send to you, I just want to send to Dagotchi eth, but I actually send to one of these fresh addresses that I generate from looking up your stealth meta address on a public registry or from your ens name or whatever. And this can just completely be built, even with this really simple proof of concept I had there. You already have all the tools to build this is just now doing sort of the front end and thinking about all of these little details that you could get right for people about the ux, like, okay, well, so then how about when you want to sort of conglomerate all the assets or use defi? One big problem with stealth addresses by themselves is that then imagine now I want to take all my money and I want to provide eth to aave, but I had privacy, and I had privacy because people sent me eth a million times, and each time they sent it to a fresh address. Now, I'll leak my privacy either way. If I either try to conglomerate all that ETH into one address that sort of links all of those together, or even if I had some weird protocol where actually what's happening is I, in one set of transactions, provide liquidity to ave with all those addresses, well, a, huge gas overhead, and b, still pretty obvious to link all those addresses. So that's where what I was saying about this, there's this nocturn protocol interested in stealth addresses that I think what's cool is they're using stealth addresses, but also something kind of like a tornado or something so that you can deal with this linkability problem later.
00:47:57.112 - 00:48:20.186, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a big issue because when you think about the tornado, if you do send in like one mil, then try and take it out, you obviously know you can link it. And the self addresses, if you is the same problem, there's just multiple addresses. Sure, you send it to unlinked ones, but as soon as you try to use a protocol and try and use all the money in one go, then it's back square one and negates the.
00:48:20.208 - 00:48:50.338, Speaker A: Whole or even smaller problems. And you can see this in Vitalik's blog post and stuff, which is just like, what if I sent you some tokens? One really cool thing about stealth addresses is unlike tornado, it doesn't just have to be one class of assets or anything. It immediately works for all tokens, all nfts, whatever I want to send to your address, because I can just sort of send something to this random, fresh address and it could be anything that works on Ethereum. However, let's say I sent you an NFT stealthily, right? I sent you some stealth malady, and you don't want anyone to know you've.
00:48:50.354 - 00:48:53.190, Speaker B: Got the malady, secret malady, undercover.
00:48:54.090 - 00:49:39.658, Speaker A: And this is all great, but now you want to go do something or move that milady to somewhere else or sell it or something. That address has no Eth in it. Are you going to add ETH and from what address? Because you don't want it to be a linked one or you lose all the privacy. And so these little edge cases are what this kind of like wallet that I'm envisioning would be able to sort of manage for you under the hood somehow, amazingly, where maybe it's tornadoing eth all the time and then depositing eth a little bit in each of these, and then sometimes conglomerating things or all these sort of really hard problems you'd have to solve, but that eventually the idea would be to give you a seamless experience. So it's just as simple as your existing wallets. Today, you feel like it's just one wallet. But actually we've made a huge advancement in everybody transacting with much more privacy.
00:49:39.658 - 00:49:46.070, Speaker A: And the cool thing is, once you and I, and the more people that do it, the privacy kind of has this nonlinear thing.
00:49:46.220 - 00:50:15.760, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the only bad thing about privacy is that in the future, I think there'll be huge kycs on every single exchange. And so you would be limited to the crypto ecosystem. And then it comes like, okay, if you want to use the IRL, how will people even accept it? And so then it becomes worthless if you can't use it IRL only within this crypto game of itself, you kind of get it out in any way, and it's like, oh, well, what's the point in it, for sure?
00:50:17.410 - 00:50:50.986, Speaker A: The only thing I would say back to that, right, is, of course, it's extremely lofty, but the dream would be that you have protocols like this all like, yeah, super open source, really easy for everyone to use, so everyone's opting in all the time. And then also eth for payments is a real thing. And so then I can just pay you an ETH to your stealth address and to get my IRL goods and so on, which, of course, again, right, nobody buys this. This is pie in the sky thinking. But this would be a really cool future again, for the sort of future of transacting and freedom to transact and so on.
00:50:51.008 - 00:51:16.174, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Privacy is something that I hope will get a lot better, especially in a day and age of Internet and AI coming on. You imagine, like, AI agents just kind of roaming the Internet in the future as well. It would just keep on getting worse and worse to the point of privacy is hard to have. I think there was a book on this, something similar. It was like 2057, something like that. They kind of talk about the future and surveillance and whatnot.
00:51:16.174 - 00:51:23.430, Speaker B: It's pretty scary, and it could be pretty realistic as well. But until that day, we'll just keep playing Ponzi nomics and crypto.
00:51:25.290 - 00:51:59.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I think surveillance is a really cool issue. I also think surveillance will just keep getting better, too. Right. So even though cryptography has been massively accelerating and helping us, also, surveillance just always keeps finding ways to keep surveying you. And in a world of AI agents everywhere and cameras and so on, maybe even if we have all this amazing cryptographic tech and stuff, there are still new ways where they try to surveil and pinpoint you. So I don't think it's going to be easy to kind of slay the surveillance state in any way, but at least there's some optimism with crypto.
00:51:59.406 - 00:52:20.120, Speaker B: Slowly chip at it until you hit a breaking point where they can't do anything about it. Crypto is getting there. It's a good step. I don't think we've ever seen something like this before. It was great chatting with you and very thought provoking conversation, and it'll be interesting to see how the future plays out. And we look back at this and be like, oh, sick. We were right or completely wrong.
00:52:21.370 - 00:52:59.414, Speaker A: Yeah, I love watching it play out in crypto because it's so messy. But over the really long term, there will definitely be some effects where we can say, whoa, that really happened. But it's like, it's real timescale. The funniest thing about crypto is all these short term thinking people all the time in this Ponzi nomics, like you say, the real timescale of crypto is tens, 50s, hundreds of years. That's how even the person who designed bitcoin, whoever they are, thought about at least 140 year schedule in advance. So we'll see what happens. And I love that it's going to take that long to see, like in 10, 20, 30 years, I think, is when we'll even just validate was Eth or bitcoin the right road? Do applications matter or not? I have no idea.
00:52:59.414 - 00:53:03.206, Speaker A: So, anyway, I'm pumped to just see the future out in front of me.
00:53:03.228 - 00:53:07.158, Speaker B: So, yeah, thank you so much for jumping on cassandra, and I'm sure we'll speak again soon.
00:53:07.244 - 00:53:10.886, Speaker A: Yeah, it was awesome meeting you. Thanks for having me, and, yeah, see you around.
00:53:10.988 - 00:53:12.020, Speaker B: Likewise. Take care.
