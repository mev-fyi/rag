00:00:00.330 - 00:00:19.310, Speaker A: I teach people on Twitter, I create threads, I create articles. Just basically give value. That's how you build your name, build your brand. And in general, in life, once you want to get value, first give value for free and help people. And that's how I basically built my brand.
00:00:20.130 - 00:00:26.950, Speaker B: Gm. Gm. Everyone, my name is Tagarchi. Welcome back to scraping bits. I'm here with Johnny time. How's it going, man?
00:00:27.020 - 00:00:29.654, Speaker A: Awesome. Glad to be here. Thank you for inviting me.
00:00:29.692 - 00:00:44.540, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. It's great to have you on. We've had great conversations in the past. You've done tremendous things, made massive strides, especially with content creation, teaching a lot of people to get to that next segue. It's basically, what do you do?
00:00:46.110 - 00:00:59.290, Speaker A: Yes. So my name is Johnny, goes by Johnny time, if you don't know either. On Twitter. On YouTube. Also on LinkedIn. Yeah. So I'm doing smart contract auditing.
00:00:59.290 - 00:01:53.730, Speaker A: I'm cybersecurity researcher of twelve years experience in traditional cybersecurity. Also got some quite experience in blockchain development, bitcoin, ethereum, solidity, and shifted to web3 security around two years ago. So I founded Ginger security together with my partner Gershon. We offer smart contract audits and I also create a lot of content, educational content on YouTube. I have my YouTube channel, Johnnytime, where I create a lot of educational content about DeFi, about smart contract hacking, auditing and such. And I have launched the smart contract hacking course and the blockchain security academy around three months ago, I believe. And since then it's going pretty well.
00:01:53.730 - 00:02:41.322, Speaker A: The students are super happy with the course, with the community. They have some awesome results. They show them on Twitter, on LinkedIn, and I'm getting a lot of very positive messages and reviews, and they definitely love it. So I'm glad to contribute to the space in education. I've been doing education all my life in my military service in the IDF back then. In 2013, I was the graduate of the first cybersecurity course in the IDF, and then I was chosen to be commander and teacher. So I basically trained the next generation of cybersecurity defenders.
00:02:41.322 - 00:03:36.098, Speaker A: This was traditional cybersecurity. I started my education journey back then, teaching journey, and since then I did it in many more places. If it's in the private sector, after I finished the service, if it's in foreign countries, I was sent to manage and teach courses, build materials, exercises in traditional cybersecurity. All this kind of stuff of designing networks, attack scenarios, also how to find incident response, how to find the attack a bit of malware analysis. And this is what I was doing for, like, ten years, like cybersecurity education. And in the last two years, I shifted it into web3 security education, because I do believe that the future is there. There is a lot of potential in Defi and cybersecurity there.
00:03:36.098 - 00:03:44.050, Speaker A: And, yeah, I think I've talked too much. So I will let you ask more questions because I have a lot of things to explain and describe.
00:03:44.630 - 00:03:59.482, Speaker B: We love all that information. It's really interesting that your background is with the IDF. So the Israel Defense Force. So did you choose to get into teaching, or was it kind of, like, assigned to you? Yeah. How did that go about?
00:03:59.616 - 00:04:35.774, Speaker A: So the way that it goes, it's actually a very interesting question, because initially I didn't choose to go for teaching. Usually the staff, they offer the students, the best students to come and do the teaching. Initially, I didn't want to because there was some kind of, like, lucrative units that I wanted to reach. And then I reached some kind of specific unit, actually, in the Navy. In the cybersecurity unit of the Navy. I've done that for one year. So I've built the whole SoC operation.
00:04:35.774 - 00:05:06.878, Speaker A: There wasn't SoC back then, so I helped to build this SoC operation and the security for the network, this particular network. And these are things that I cannot talk about much because it's classified. But then after one year, they basically were searching. I mean, I wanted to do something else. I wanted to try education. And there was a vacancy. They also searched for, like, a teacher or commander for the course, and it was perfect.
00:05:06.878 - 00:05:11.358, Speaker A: And I just changed my unit, and I moved to teach the course.
00:05:11.444 - 00:05:20.610, Speaker B: Very interesting that you're teaching cybersecurity in a military. I think that is probably the best credential you could probably have in cybersecurity.
00:05:22.550 - 00:06:00.586, Speaker A: Yeah. And I not only teached, I did one year of practical in cybersecurity unit. So I got the practical experience and I got the teaching experience. And to be honest, I learned much more while teaching, I got to say. And we also have some kind of competition, like CTF, but cybersecurity, CTF. So imagine you have, like, a huge room, one full day, and you have a lot of tables. Every table is like a group of, like, three or four people from different units, and it's like 20 teams that are all participating and trying to hack a network or capture flex.
00:06:00.586 - 00:06:44.014, Speaker A: It's like DFI, CTF, but in computer networks, you need to hack machines to jump from one web server to another server, to jump between segments of the network and eventually to achieve all the flags. And the funny story is that we were a team. We participated as a team of all the commanders against all the other units. So it was Navy, Air Force, it was like 20 teams, different units. And we took the first place. The teachers, the commanders of the course, the ones who doesn't. People usually say that the teachers that don't have the actual experience or like they go to teach because they don't know how to do the job.
00:06:44.014 - 00:06:58.642, Speaker A: But eventually we show that we were the best. And I learned so much more just in this unit of that educate and teach. Because once you teach something, you need to know it like 100% and be sure and do the research. Very good.
00:06:58.696 - 00:07:40.042, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. In order to teach, you have to be a master at it, or at least be insane, like really comprehensive in it, where you can basically simplify any complex topic and convey it to the person you're teaching and make them understand in a very concise way, basically relaying information as easy as possible. So having said that, I guess what are sort of the techniques to teach effectively? And I'm sure you've applied this to your course and you've learnt it over the years in the military and even now you're still learning. But I guess, what are the core things that make you an effective teacher?
00:07:40.106 - 00:08:05.586, Speaker A: It's a very good question. And actually, before you teach in the IDF, you go through a course, one and a half months of how to be a commander and a teacher, and they teach you seven things. Seven things. Now, I don't remember all of them, but let's see what I can recall. So first of all, it's like frontal teaching. So it's like in a classroom. I used to teach a lot in front of students, like 30 people, 40 people in a classroom.
00:08:05.698 - 00:08:06.070, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:06.140 - 00:08:34.930, Speaker A: So they say one of the most important thing is excitement. You should be excited about what you're talking about. And once you're excited, the student is going to be excited and is going to listen to you more. Okay. There is also a lot of tips about. So every subject that you talk about, you should be super excited and interested about. If you are not, it will be the difference between, like, okay, let's say I want to teach about reentry attacks, so I can teach about.
00:08:34.930 - 00:08:52.774, Speaker A: Yeah, reentry attacks. There are some kind of attacks in smart contracts. This is like without excitement. So reentry attack is a very interesting attack when it comes to smart contracts and it leads to millions of dollars being. You see the difference, right?
00:08:52.812 - 00:08:53.110, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:53.180 - 00:09:30.180, Speaker A: So this is like the excitement. There are some tricks of how to play with your voice, so you cannot have the same tonality all the time. So the interesting thing about reentry attacks, so you go up and down with your voice to make it more interesting. All these kind of things I learned in the course, and you learn them once you teach more, you learn the techniques, use your hands. So if you just. I cannot show you right now because you cannot see in the frames. But when you speak, you talk with your hands, basically your whole body expressing what you're saying.
00:09:30.180 - 00:10:14.762, Speaker A: Eyes, you keep eye contact. It's a bit different than content creation in YouTube because you don't have the audience and the students, but you keep eye contact with your students sometimes or ask them questions, make them be active. So instead of just talking about replay attacks, I would just ask. All right, guys, take a look at this code snippet and tell me what's the problem here? What do you think? How would you exploit it? Or like, anyone knows how accounts works in the EVM, because once you activate their brain, they are like thinking, they are active participants, they are active learners. And not just listening, listening. So these are just some points. There is also movement.
00:10:14.762 - 00:10:30.646, Speaker A: You move around the class, you don't stay in a single spot. So it's like seven rules of thumb that once you follow them, your teaching level goes like beyond. This is something we can talk of, 1 hour talk, just how to public speak and how to teach, for sure.
00:10:30.668 - 00:10:58.522, Speaker B: Yeah, they go hand in hand and it's a skill, right. It's not something you just kind of like naturally. I mean, you can be naturally gifted, but it's something you can also develop. And that's obviously why they were teaching that. And I think it's a perfect skill and credentials to have to basically create this course in web free where you're teaching security. You've onboarded the best to take part as guest lecturers. You've had trust Owen Byteso, 32 and Pajov.
00:10:58.522 - 00:11:19.766, Speaker B: Hopefully I said that name right. These are like the elite in web3 and they're featured on your course and hundreds of people are using this course. And I remember when I first saw it, I actually bought it instantly because I was super hyped as well. But basically, why did you start this? Why did you choose to do teaching in web3 as well? And how did you really build this course from the ground up?
00:11:19.868 - 00:11:43.374, Speaker A: Yeah. So you asked some very good questions. First, if it's a skill or you can learn it, I definitely believe that. I mean, if it's a skill or something that you are gifted with or something that you can achieve, I believe that anyone can learn how to teach and anyone can learn how to public speak. They need to want it. They need to like it. And if you like something, you can do it.
00:11:43.374 - 00:12:29.594, Speaker A: That's my belief. Whatever you like, whatever you have passion to do, you can do either. If it's smart, contract auditing, cybersecurity, or public speaking, just go and work and practice. It's a skill you can practice. And more than that, every once in a while, when I learned how to teach, and also during, when I'm teaching, we come to each other classes and with a notebook, and we give feedback to each other. So when I teach, let's say I teach like web application hacking in front of the students, I have my other colleague that is sitting there and it's like checking, okay, how I enter the class? Do I use my hands enough? How is my excitement level? Oh, here I missed a student that was, I don't know, he wasn't focused. So it's a skill that you improve every time.
00:12:29.594 - 00:13:02.614, Speaker A: And I saw how I improved the skill. This is one about a course. Yeah, we have all kinds of awesome goats, Webtree people on board. This is awesome because I want to give the most amount of value to the student, and I know that, okay, I have my experience. I am good at public speaking and teaching and education. But if they can learn more from other awesome professionals, my goal was to bring them on board so they can show their experience. The students can learn from them from the best.
00:13:02.614 - 00:13:19.834, Speaker A: I'm happy that those people were on the same mindset and they were willing to join. And this is amazing. And everyone is happy, so I'm happy as well. And what was the last question? Sorry, the main question, how did you go?
00:13:19.872 - 00:13:24.798, Speaker B: Why I decided building this, building it from the ground up. And what was that process like?
00:13:24.884 - 00:13:45.742, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very good question. So it's like a startup. It's like a project. There is nothing. And you have an idea, you have a vision and the whole idea and vision. And then it started for me, start basically learning myself. I wanted to shift from web two security to web3 security, because I see there is lack of talent.
00:13:45.742 - 00:14:07.482, Speaker A: There's a lot of hacks going on. A lot of money is on the stake. Unlike traditional cybersecurity, where people hack databases, information networks, here, when you hack a contract, that's it, the money is gone. You can anonymously steal the fund using mixtures like tornado cash and such. And get your money. And that's it. It's gone.
00:14:07.482 - 00:14:39.842, Speaker A: So I was motivated to go all in into web3 security. And then I started obviously learning myself. And I went through different tutorials and videos and articles and GitHub repositories and it was all over the place. And then I thought, okay, it's good. It means that there is a lot of things to contribute here because we are in the beginning. So probably there are not that many people that are doing that. And if I come now, I can make it better, I can make it bigger.
00:14:39.842 - 00:15:14.158, Speaker A: And one of the things that I saw lacking is like structured education process, structured practical education process. And I said, this is a match. I literally woke up some morning and I thought, I believe in God. And I'm like, okay, God, I know what you want me to do. This is my goal. This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to improve the education in the space and create a complete practical course, a to z, taking all my experience of like ten years of education in cybersecurity and apply it to web3 security.
00:15:14.158 - 00:16:02.222, Speaker A: Because I also believe in learn by doing, learn by practicing every course that I teach, either if it's in the IDF, in the private sector or later on Singapore. This is another story. Always it's like 30% lecturing and teaching concepts and 70% hacking practical experience. Okay, so if I used to teach people about SQL injection, yeah, I teach them the concept. I show them some examples, some demos, but then they sit 3 hours on their ass and they are trying to hack websites with different kind of SQL injection. And I wanted to apply the same method because I know that it works the best and that's how you create ninjas to web3 smart contract hacking. And this is exactly what I did.
00:16:02.222 - 00:16:24.280, Speaker A: I built something from scratch with the same concepts, same education concepts that I know to web3 security. So you have like a lecture where you learn a concept, let's say access control vulnerabilities. Right after you have four exercises where you need to sit and break your head around them and observe this knowledge while doing.
00:16:24.650 - 00:16:53.780, Speaker B: You've had to go through that process of doing it all yourself as well. I guess when you're looking back at it, you know the exact path to take to get to that point the fastest, right? And I guess that's how you bring that sort of structure to the course as well. Since you've done it, you know how to get there fastest. And you can convey that in a way that it's so efficient and so concise that you actually get them faster than if you were to do it again.
00:16:55.430 - 00:17:28.186, Speaker A: Exactly. And it's funny that we have a repository of all the exercises of the course. So initially when I started this repository, it was for me to learn smart contract hacking. So I learned access control. Okay, I searched all over the web for exercises or attacks that happened where the vulnerability was lack of access control, and I did it on my local machine, I took the smart contract and then I wrote a test and I tried to hack it and then I was like okay, let's convert. Okay, I did it, I learned it. Let's let other lens in.
00:17:28.186 - 00:17:53.314, Speaker A: So let's make out of it an exercise. So that's how it started actually I learned myself. I created this repository because this is also high island, the best. I can read 2 hours or watch ten videos about access control. That's not enough, you need to actually do it with your own hands. And then I converted this repository to exercises repository. So this is the infamous exercises repository that all the students are now taking.
00:17:53.314 - 00:18:06.914, Speaker A: It started from like they won't see the commits because it's like I just copied the exercises to another repository for the student. But the first commit it was like learn access control vulnerabilities or learn some other kind of vulnerabilities.
00:18:06.962 - 00:19:04.246, Speaker B: It's funny, learning step by step like different kind of attack vectors and then basically making proof of concepts and then building your own exercises and then applying it. Right. And then after that you turned it into an exercise more concise with basically step by step. Okay, this is what you have to do, turning into like a format where you could basically produce other hackers and yeah, I think that's really interesting because I did the same thing with my articles when I was learning about call data. I was actually learning step by step as well. And I was like okay, how do I keep note of this? And then I started building an article actually just for my own personal benefit, but it just turns out that I did such great research on it that I could convey it to anyone that reads it for the first time in a very simple way and they understand it the first read. And somehow that kind of blew up my reputation.
00:19:04.246 - 00:19:24.906, Speaker B: That's the same thing that happened with you as well. Your course and your education has really boosted your reputation and I'm sure your network as well. But during building this course, what were the difficulties of really building it? Like the process? What were the hardest things that you've encountered while building this course?
00:19:25.028 - 00:20:07.662, Speaker A: The difficulty is that you're doing something new, like a startup, you're doing something from scratch. First of all, I never built an online course from scratch. I did create YouTube videos, I did teach a lot, but I never created a course a to z. So it starts from the syllabus, what should be inside, what should be outside, is it too much? Is it not enough? This is one difficulty, decide what's going to be in the curriculum of the course. Then obviously it's tons amount of hours of work. I'm working on this course for one year already before it lands, it's several months where I just.
00:20:07.716 - 00:20:08.830, Speaker B: Was that full time?
00:20:08.980 - 00:20:47.562, Speaker A: Yeah. So initially I had like a part time job in a webtree company as a consultor, consultation job one day a week. And also we had some audits in ginger security. So it depends on the month, but the majority of the time I invested on the course. So it was almost like full time, part time, like half time plus, I would say. And the more we got to the launch date of the course and the timeline, the schedule was more pressuring. Then I made more time for the course because I had to launch it on time.
00:20:47.562 - 00:21:19.094, Speaker A: I don't know if you remember, we sold it before it was launched. Yeah, we sold it before it was launched and there was a deadline. You got a chance to buy it cheaper before it's launched because you show believe in the course. So it's obviously like early bird ticket kind of sale. And then on March it launched. I would say that February was the most stressful month. February, march, finally finishing up all the lectures, all the exercises and launching it on time.
00:21:19.094 - 00:21:48.590, Speaker A: It was very challenging. So this was another challenge. Another challenge is like how do you do course online? What platform to use? You record the videos, what if there is something that you are not happy about? Re record them, the exercises. How do I make sure that the students are not getting too many hints or is it too hard, too easy. You really need to think through and design it. Yeah. Choose the platform, where to host the videos.
00:21:48.590 - 00:22:29.594, Speaker A: How do you fight piracy? This is another thing, you work so much on it and some people just download it for free or like, okay, what out of value do we give them apart from the course? So it wouldn't make sense just to try to search it. Partly because they also get community, they also get certificate. All these kind of things are extra perks, extra bonuses that they get. And it's more fun through the platform because it has some kind of gamification. You complete classes, you mark them, you see your progress bar. So it's a lot of things that wouldn't make sense to do it. Partly why it's just small.
00:22:29.594 - 00:22:56.134, Speaker A: There are so many challenges also, okay. It's a decision to make. Time is valuable, and once you do something like this, you think, okay, what if there will be only ten students buying? What if it's not that interesting? It's like new market. It's something that no one did before. I don't talk about courses, but courses for web3 security. So I don't know, what if it's not going to be good. You have all these questions around your what if? No one will be interested.
00:22:56.252 - 00:22:57.858, Speaker B: What if syndrome?
00:22:57.954 - 00:23:03.090, Speaker A: Yeah. Like every other project, every other startup. It's like a startup.
00:23:03.170 - 00:23:52.870, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. And there was also some release backfire. I remember there was like a tweet, people kind of talking down on paid courses and web free because they were mentioning basically all the information is out there, which is correct, right. Like all the information is free, but the value is you've spent hundreds of hours building, doing this, basically catering for the person reading. So you basically aggregated all the resources, built some kind of system to teach this effectively, and that's basically what they're paying for. So it's like value for time. Sure, they can go basically do their own research, do it all for free, but that's going to take far longer than this very structured kind of source.
00:23:52.870 - 00:24:41.714, Speaker B: Instead of scattering different tabs, not having any real progress or pathway, they might diverge or it's harder to stick to that. So that's where the value really is in courses. And people like Johnny spend hundreds of hours on this stuff, so it's really valuable. Even if the price looks pricey. You've got to realize the amount of time they've put in their past credentials, basically how much time they've put in and how well they've structured it. Because Johnny's got a dozen years, well, he's got years in the IDF, and that's let alone in teaching in the IDF. And that, let alone is incredibly powerful.
00:24:41.714 - 00:25:07.998, Speaker B: You're learning from a cybersecurity master that was basically teaching people, the military. Right. And good luck trying to find someone like that teaching for free on the Internet. Right. And then he's built this course for you in a structured way with all this experience behind him. So just keep that in mind when buying a course. I think a lot of people don't want to buy courses because it looks pricey, but in the long run it's really cheap for the information you're getting.
00:25:07.998 - 00:25:10.158, Speaker B: Would you say that's kind of spot on.
00:25:10.324 - 00:25:39.900, Speaker A: Yeah, that's very good points that you said over there. Usually I'm trying to shift my focus from bad energy to good energy. That's why I had to react to this post. But I said what I had to say and I don't want to engage in more conversations because I prefer to focus on good vibes and good energy. That's why. Also, whenever we get a refund request, it doesn't happen. Often it doesn't happen.
00:25:39.900 - 00:25:56.826, Speaker A: It barely happens, actually. We don't even argue with a person. We have maybe five or ten refunds of students. Some of them took 50% of the course. And they say, okay, we are not happy with the course. We don't even argue with them. We just immediately, okay, that's your refund.
00:25:56.826 - 00:26:25.266, Speaker A: Get a full refund. Because we do believe that the course is so valuable and we see also the reviews and the messages that I receive from people. I have so many messages that people are affecting me. Thank you so much for this course. It's the best course I've ever taken in my life. I got one message that said that I never paid for a course, and this is my first Paris course, and I'm super happy I've done that. And next week I have an interview as a junior smart contract auditor.
00:26:25.266 - 00:27:06.578, Speaker A: I wouldn't do it without your course. So once you get these kind of messages, like 99% of the time, you kind of ignore the negativity. This is my motto and this is how I look at things now. What do you say about why would people pay such amount of money? We get also messages of people that say that they paid thousands of dollars for sans cybersecurity courses and it doesn't come nearly to the level and quality of this course. And they are shocked that so much value is being given to them for such low price. This is the kind of messages that we get, and I have like print screens and testimonials for so many people now. What you said is right.
00:27:06.578 - 00:27:49.474, Speaker A: You can go and take the long path. It's okay. I also am a self learner and I like to learn from free resources like YouTube videos and articles and githubs. But I know for sure that if I had a chance back then to take something like this, like some kind of structured course, like this, practical, with exercises that can take me from complete beginner to intermediate level, and also I would get a chance to involve in a community and meet people and eventually also do some kind of test and get certificate. I would not think twice. I would just purchase it right away because I believe in buying time. I believe in paying money to buy yourself time outsourcing stuff.
00:27:49.474 - 00:28:35.106, Speaker A: And if someone worked for me and did the whole course and someone with so many years of experience, and if it can save me time, like two, three, four months of learning, and it can be even better experience for me, I would be more than happy to pay money for that. And this is what we're bringing. This is the product that we're bringing. We are basically making the learning time shorter, making the learning experience much better, giving you the opportunity to go through a community, learn, meet with people, engage with people that help you. Or maybe we have some people that are collaborating and doing auditing contents. We had other interesting opportunities in the community. Like we have some students that are participating as interns in audits for ginger security.
00:28:35.106 - 00:29:13.454, Speaker A: Obviously it's a paid position. They get money for that. Sometimes we bring small audits closed for the community where they can also earn money, but it's mostly to test their skills and to get some practical experience. So if I would get all of that back then, when I started learning web3 security, it was a no brainer not to get a course. So this is like the main value proposition as I see it. And we also have some students that already made so much more money thanks to the skills they gained or if they were participated as interns in general security than the amount of money they paid for the course.
00:29:13.652 - 00:29:33.550, Speaker B: Yeah, value, really like the time you're saving is just remarkable. But yeah, I just want to also touch on how did you really build this brand from scratch and how did you really get that first client to come in and take a risk?
00:29:33.630 - 00:29:35.700, Speaker A: You mean the chorus or ginger security?
00:29:36.390 - 00:29:51.660, Speaker B: Both, because it's kind of the same, right? You're building a brand and then you have to give them trust and security and all that stuff. So how did you go about building a brand? And you've done a great job so far, and it's obviously working. So let's hear it.
00:29:52.670 - 00:30:25.698, Speaker A: Yeah. So first of all, I created a website that represents the course. It got through some kind of evolution. It already always got better. I use my existing social media channels like Twitter and LinkedIn and YouTube to tell to people about the course. And initially it was very wasn't. There were some people who bought it, and I remember the first, 2nd, 3rd time that people actually purchased it before it's even ready.
00:30:25.698 - 00:31:10.734, Speaker A: Initially we promoted it for $200 in the early bird cell. It was like one week, the last week of 2022, and we got, I don't remember maybe 20 or 30 people purchasing, and I was like, oh my God, I was shocked. People are actually paying money for me and they believe in me, and they don't get a course yet. It was like this was my validation that, okay, I'm doing something right, I'm doing something in the right path. People need it, people want it, and there is a demand for that. And it gave me even more motivation to continue and finish the course as soon as possible, because now I also have obligation to these people who paid. So that's also one of the reasons that I did this early bird.
00:31:10.734 - 00:31:43.102, Speaker A: It's also a secret. It's some kind of trick to motivate me and to push me to finish the course, because you can always do more, you can always add more subjects to the syllabus, you can always create more exercises to make the slides look better, the edits better. But it's like a startup. You need some kind of deadline. You need some kind of deadline. And the fact that I gave a launch, that it pushed me to really finish the creation of the course. If not, I could work on it for two years.
00:31:43.102 - 00:32:27.066, Speaker A: It's like an artist, you can go and work on a painting for three or four years, and it's something that happens to a lot of startups. Instead of ship the product, they just work and work and work, and they don't validate it with the market. So I wanted to validate it with the market, and I was able to validate it. And then it put me this deadline over my head that I have to deliver the course by this kind of date. And that's how it started. And then I started to mingle with people in the space. And before, actually I, Andy interviewed it to his channel, and I interviewed Pashov to my YouTube channel when I just started working on the course.
00:32:27.066 - 00:33:09.414, Speaker A: And because I had those connections, I was able to bring this idea of bringing collaborators to work with me on the course, or create some guest lectures and also become affiliates of the course. Because I had these connections back then, it was easier for me to approach people in the space and tell them, hey, guys, I'm building something that no one has built before. It's going to be great for the community. I have a proposition for you. Do you want to join me? And that's why I reached out to trust to Pashov, to Owen, to bytes 32. And they were on board because they saw through my vision. Even though they are very busy people, trust is super busy.
00:33:09.414 - 00:33:43.026, Speaker A: His hourly rate is extremely high, and 1 hour of trust is expensive and he was willing to work on that and to see it and record lectures. And this is good. Also Pashov. Pashov also very expensive. Hourly rate. Actually yesterday we had a video call like catch up and there is also interview coming with Pashov, like part two. I was the first one who interviewed Pashov and now we're going to do part two to observe how he progressed through this time and what kind of news.
00:33:43.128 - 00:34:20.622, Speaker B: And even these really top tier people, I'm sure they would even get benefit from these guest lecturers as well, like Peshaw maybe listening to trust's lecturer and then the reverse. I'm sure they would also pick up some valuable insight. Yeah, I guess let's theoretically say that nobody really knows you right before you've released this course and you want to build a name for yourself from the ground up. So basically start, let's say Twitter from scratch. Your whole identity is from scratch. What would you do differently to really accelerate the rate? At what?
00:34:20.676 - 00:34:57.850, Speaker A: To be honest? Yeah, it's going to be much more challenging for sure, because once you have an identity and you have a brand, people trust you more. And actually when I started I didn't have identity in web3 security. My identity was in Johnny time. I had like ten K subscribers on YouTube, but I was teaching people mainly DFI. I didn't teach them smart contract hacking and auditing. So I didn't have much identity in the web3 space and I built it actually also from the ground. When I started the YouTube channel, I basically taught people what I'm doing.
00:34:57.850 - 00:36:03.022, Speaker A: So I was a DFI user, I was exploring liquidity pools, amms, lending protocols, and I taught people, hey look, you can deposit, I don't know, 10,000 uSDT in ave get 10% a year, then you can borrow eth and you can take this eth, put it on this and that protocol. So I taught them and when I shifted my focus from DeFi to web3 security, I shifted my channel obviously to teaching about web3 security. So I just publish value, publish content, publish, teach people about cybersecurity, I teach people on Twitter, I create threads, I create articles, just basically give value. That's how you build your name, build your brand. And in general in life, once you want to get value, first give value for free and help people. And that's how I basically built my brand. And yeah, it helps obviously, because people trust you, people know you, people know that you know how to teach how to simplify concepts, they know that you have the skills, the experience, for sure.
00:36:03.076 - 00:36:20.982, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. You got to provide value to basically receive value. Right. I think that goes with anything in life, whether it's building a startup. You've got to provide time and effort, just working hard, and then eventually it's going to pay off, hopefully. Right. And then you get some value back in the long run.
00:36:20.982 - 00:36:31.706, Speaker B: But I'm guessing that's the same thing with Gingersec, right? Like building that clientele, getting your name out there, and providing high quality work to really get them on board and other people. Is that kind of correct?
00:36:31.808 - 00:37:06.126, Speaker A: Yes, definitely. With Ginger Sac, we had another value proposition because both Gershon and I have plenty of years of experience in traditional cybersecurity, like IDF experience. And this is a very, like you said before, it's a very strong certificate. I was on the defense side. Gershon was on the attack side. Gershon was the one who is creating malware, attacking networks. But both of us know how to think like black hats, because I saw live attacks and I defended against live attacks.
00:37:06.126 - 00:37:59.030, Speaker A: And Gershon was an attacker in networks, in remote networks. So this is a very strong value proposition when you have this kind of real life experience, black hat experience and white hat experience. And when you come to projects and you tell them, look, we are like a team of hackers with years of experience, and we have so many credentials and testimonials, they are like, okay, that's interesting. It's also a bit like, funny to say, but when you say like, you are in Israel and the IDF, it's known that Israel is like it and cybersecurity nation. And it's also helped in terms of the credentials. And it's also true because a lot of cybersecurity companies are started in Israel and checkpoints. Palo Alto is us.
00:37:59.030 - 00:38:41.458, Speaker A: But yeah, there is a lot of cybersecurity startups and companies in Israel because the IDF is also known as one of the best in cybersecurity. So this also helped to build to get clients and to get our name out there. And also, actually, before I knew that Owen is using the PPV PayPal vulnerability model, we came up with this model without even knowing. We came up with this as well. So we offered clients like base fee, which is just to going through the code base and getting familiar with it. And then they pay per vulnerability. So they pay only for every vulnerability that we found by classification, easy, medium and high.
00:38:41.458 - 00:39:26.574, Speaker A: And this was no brainer for them. Like, okay, the risk, okay, only $2,000, but for every extra dollar that I pay, it's basically, I save dollars that could be stolen for my protocol, for my users. So it was a very good model and they really liked it. And, yeah, so these two value propositions were enabling us to get a decent amount of clients. And also Gershon went to a lot of conferences and met many founders and many people in the space. Basically, the more is like from personal connections and from people who recommend us. So there is client that was happy with the audit, and he tell to another client, and we get leads and calls like that.
00:39:26.612 - 00:39:32.750, Speaker B: And that's kind of how you build like a network. You provide great value, then they just refer you to other people they know in their network.
00:39:32.830 - 00:39:55.610, Speaker A: Definitely, yeah. And for every audit, we try to give the most amount of value and to find a lot of vulnerabilities also in the mitigation process. Even though we don't charge for the mitigation process, we are 100% there for the client to make sure that they apply the fixes and the patches in the right way without leaving other vulnerabilities or creating new ones.
00:39:55.680 - 00:40:15.138, Speaker B: Another thing is, how do you really separate yourself from the competition? Let's say you're a new firm coming out with no basic prior experience, no reputation yet, because you just started. Right. How would you go about, I guess, getting that initial client and then going from there?
00:40:15.224 - 00:40:22.306, Speaker A: You mean like as an initial firm, single smart contract private auditor or a.
00:40:22.328 - 00:40:28.838, Speaker B: Firm smart contract auditor and firm. You still need to get that initial client, right?
00:40:28.924 - 00:41:05.026, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very good question and very interesting one, I would say. Always focus on the value that you bring. So if it's initially to bring value, even for free, go for it. Okay, so this is also something that Owen shared in one of this video, how to lend your first client. Just give know, go to a protocol, just audit the code, or, I don't know, take some observation on the code, give them some tips. Reach out to the devs or to the protocol. Hey, I saw that you're doing here and there.
00:41:05.026 - 00:41:35.370, Speaker A: And just give value initially for free. Either if it's directly to protocols or just on your channels, if it's like YouTube channel, Twitter account articles. Yeah, just bring value and eventually offer your services. And once you bring more value, we'll get more exposure. People will see your skills and qualities, and eventually you can charge money for your skills and get clients.
00:41:35.790 - 00:41:54.802, Speaker B: Definitely. Another thing I wanted to touch on was within while auditing right now, what do you think is kind of like missing from the space and what you wish you could have. If you could bring a tool into existence to make your experience as an auditor easier, what would you bring?
00:41:54.936 - 00:42:07.146, Speaker A: I would say it's something that I didn't explore much, but, okay, I will compare it to web two security. In web two security, you have a tool called burp suite suit.
00:42:07.198 - 00:42:07.510, Speaker B: Okay.
00:42:07.580 - 00:43:12.070, Speaker A: It's a tool that basically it's a local proxy where you can set up and every request that goes from your browser to the web server, you can capture and hold a proxy. You can say, okay, this request, don't let it go. And I want to look at it to observe it first. It's called local proxy, and it's very useful when you want to hack websites because you can just, for example, let's say I have a website that I'm trying to search vulnerabilities in. I have some kind of overview of all the endpoints, all the API endpoints, all the resources, all the folders of the website, all the requests that my browser created. I can take particular requests, send it into in the intruder, and then create some kind of brute force and send a lot of requests, if it's for enumeration or for trying to guess a password or some kind of authentication page. And this is something that I feel that we don't have in Webtree space, some kind of tool that connects your local machine with a live blockchain and live protocol.
00:43:12.070 - 00:43:52.678, Speaker A: So for example, I go to Uniswap or to sushiswap, some kind of local proxy that will monitor my wallet and all the transaction that I send and then show them for me. It will be very useful for bug hunting and bug bounties, because then you have an overview of uniswap. You can take every transaction and analyze it like in burp, in web applications, and try to send different parameters and see how the smart contract reacts to it. So, yeah, it's a very interesting question, and this is something that just jumped into my head. It would be very cool if there is some kind of tool like that that is doing that.
00:43:52.844 - 00:44:04.298, Speaker B: So just like something that you could just throw different inputs in, it gives you an output and you can just basically spam different ones and see how it reacts in a step by step process, right?
00:44:04.384 - 00:44:15.994, Speaker A: Yeah, one. And also gives you some kind of overview of all the transactions, all the functionalities that you get through this dap. Now, direct, you can go directly to the contract and see all the functions.
00:44:16.042 - 00:44:17.760, Speaker B: But like a control floor, right?
00:44:18.450 - 00:44:43.078, Speaker A: Yeah, some kind of control floor. Also fuzzer. You can have a fuzzer inside. You can have inside install either. If it's like, okay, let's say it's a transaction that receives an amount, you can basically send, I don't know, thousands of transactions with different amounts. Fuz it yourself, create some kind of ruling system.
00:44:43.244 - 00:45:04.960, Speaker B: Yeah. So you're basically using that to find critical bugs, right? Do you really just focus on criticals or are you really looking for, okay, what's inside the contract, within this contract? Or are you looking outside more in like game theory, whole context of the EVM and whatever's possible to interact with us. So what's your kind of approach with that?
00:45:06.770 - 00:45:58.590, Speaker A: So every audit that we get first, the first focus is to find criticals, highs and mediums, because we believe that once we find these kind of vulnerabilities, we bring the most amount of value. It would be more interesting for the protocol. And you bring more safety to the protocol once you reveal those criticals and highs, obviously because you save money of users and protocols, or you make sure the protocol, the smart contract won't be dossed and no one will be able to use it forever. So this is more interesting, but if we have some low issues, low severity or gas optimization, we also mentioned them and eventually once we assemble the report, we add them as well. But the first focus, the first priority is criticals and highs to make sure that the contract is safe to use, that user funds are safe, that the protocol is safe.
00:45:58.930 - 00:46:08.446, Speaker B: Right. And you mentioned that you go for criticals and highs first. So what is your strategy for finding, identifying and developing these critical vulnerabilities?
00:46:08.558 - 00:46:28.022, Speaker A: The first two depends how big is the code base. But the first days is really getting into the head and the mindset of the developer. So it's basically running the test, reading the docs, reading the solidity contracts from top to bottom, adding comments along the way.
00:46:28.156 - 00:46:33.194, Speaker B: What if they had no docs and no tests? Then how would you go for it?
00:46:33.232 - 00:47:03.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it happens sometimes. Then you have only your contracts to work with. So you have to read the contracts again and again until it's very bad when they don't have it. But it happens sometimes, reality. And then you work with what do you have? So if you have the contracts, you just read the contracts and try to understand them. And once you have some kind of good understanding of the protocol and what the dev was trying to achieve, what the dev was trying to do, then minually do it. You also leave some comments.
00:47:03.086 - 00:47:59.030, Speaker A: So if you see something odd like, I don't know, no check SFX interactions or no access control, or they use some kind of signature or I don't know. So you leave your comments and then you can come back and visit them. But once you know the protocol, you go to every process, every flow of the contract and see, try to think like an attacker. So, okay, a normal transaction would look like, okay, user is taking x amount and then he's getting some, let's say it's a staking contract. So user go through the stake function, he stake this amount of tokens, he supply the amount of tokens. Okay, what if he supply an amount that he doesn't possess? Does the contract check that? Maybe I can just say that I stake 1000 tokens, but I only own 200. Okay, so try to think all of the things that the developer, once he wrote the code, he didn't think of.
00:47:59.030 - 00:48:53.682, Speaker A: Try to apply the creativity and your curiosity of what would happen to the state if that, if the transaction is being sent from, I don't know, from a smart contract if I would, oh, here I have an external goal. What if I do something, enter another function, enter another contract, what happens to the state? And then you really try to apply your attack mindset thinking to find all those vulnerabilities. And sometimes when we have time, we also write fuzzing tests like using a chidna or foundry to fuzz the contract. But usually we see that the most value we can bring by just manually looking at the contract and trying to think with this kind of attacker mindset and find those exploits.
00:48:53.746 - 00:49:34.978, Speaker B: That's what differentiates you and other auditors, is that you basically go for the criticals first, try and think of out of the box solutions to basically interacting with that contract and then going from there, right? So I guess that's the real mindset of an elite hacker, is just thinking of out of the box creative ways to basically do what the dev was not intended, even thinking of if that was even going to happen. Right? Like for example, if you're using a flash loan and you're borrowing millions of, let's say, tokens and inserting that into a pool, how does that affect your contract? And are you accounting for something like that? Is that kind of right?
00:49:35.064 - 00:50:02.838, Speaker A: Exactly. It's the exact same thing in web two security. Once you write a web application, you create some kind of user flow or admin flow. You think about the user, but you don't think what a malicious user would do. Right. Also, I'm a developer as well, so when I write code, I'm very paranoid and I'm trying to write the code in a way that will be secure. And I always try to think myself how I would exploit it.
00:50:02.838 - 00:51:21.442, Speaker A: So sometimes I have too many validations or like when I create a right code, it takes me much more time because I'm trying to design it in a secure way or make sure that the validations are sufficient. But most devs, they don't have this kind of knowledge, they don't have this kind of critical thinking, this paranoid thinking. And this is a thinking that I developed through the years, because while I was defending system or sometimes doing penetration testing and trying to hack systems, I always think, what the developer missed, what did he miss in this web server? Okay, what if he didn't update his Nginx server for a while? What if when he created this kind of, I don't know, purchase process, what if I can bypass it or just don't pay for my product? So what if I can just send some input that will trigger SQl injection? Or what if I can run execute commands on the operating system? And this is the exact same critical thinking. And once you have the belief that developers make mistakes and they don't think mostly in this manner when they write the code, because they think only in the legitimate path what a legitimate user would do, you see that there are so many mistakes and so many vulnerabilities that you can find in smart contracts.
00:51:21.506 - 00:52:20.474, Speaker B: A lot of developers, I know this from experience because I started with just solidity development and I didn't know anything about cybersecurity. And I was designing my contracts in a way where I was thinking about the user and not a malicious user. I think Owen did this exact same thing and then that's what made him get into guardian audits. But yeah, it's extremely important to know what basically an adversary is going to do and what they're going to try and achieve, how they're going to steal and manipulate all the variables so it suits what they want. You can't just think about the user that are participating, but because there's going to be a user that wants to basically take over the whole contract and steal all the money. So you got to think of this as well. And it's incredibly important skill and it's not easy to learn, but people like Johnny make it much easier to get into and onboard yourself into that space.
00:52:20.474 - 00:52:43.054, Speaker B: Yeah. So definitely learn cybersecurity. And it's actually a very exciting field as well, isn't it? It's not really boring. It's constantly changing and problem solving as well. It's a different mindset for sure, but it's a fun one. Yeah, it's like PvP instead of, I guess, pve with just normal development. Right.
00:52:43.054 - 00:53:06.982, Speaker B: But we are running out of time. Johnny, it's been a pleasure having you on and basically teaching us how to teach, right. I think is a very important skill to have in any aspect of life. And if you know how to teach, you're going to master what you're basically teaching, right. The underlying content and knowledge. You're going to solidify that and be the very best of the best. And nobody can take that away from you.
00:53:06.982 - 00:53:18.018, Speaker B: You're going to even help others, which is very satisfying as well. And you'll build connections through that. So it's an endless cycle of positivity, and I think it's terrific what you're doing. Thank you so much for sharing.
00:53:18.114 - 00:53:27.920, Speaker A: Thank you so much. It was a real pleasure and you are a great host. I really enjoyed the time and I hope that the viewers also enjoyed and learned something today.
00:53:28.450 - 00:53:33.806, Speaker B: I'm sure they will, man. We'll definitely chat again soon. But until then, take care.
00:53:33.908 - 00:53:35.280, Speaker A: Thank you. You too.
