00:00:00.330 - 00:00:21.402, Speaker A: My vision is to say, can we have users pay lower fees, lps make more money, and validators make more money. The way I see that is to exceed and not participate in mev auctions. Defi will never compete with Defi if it sucks and it can provide better execution. But my alternative to say let's not have an auction, let's not reach a maximum point, but be bigger.
00:00:21.546 - 00:00:57.054, Speaker B: Scraping bits is brought to you by the following sponsors. Fastlight Labs trustless mev mev protocol. Maximize your eep staking value with me V exclusively on Mev IO and composable execute any intent on any chain. Coming soon to Manchis app that is M-A-N-T-I-S-A-P gm Gm. Everyone. My name's Tagachi, the host of scraping bits, and I'm back again with someone special, Uri, the CEO and co founder of Blockstrap. How's it going?
00:00:57.172 - 00:01:00.286, Speaker A: It's good. And you called me special, so now I feel even better.
00:01:00.388 - 00:01:04.466, Speaker B: Just for the people that aren't familiar with you, who are you and what do you do?
00:01:04.568 - 00:01:36.374, Speaker A: So, Uri, CEO and co founder of Blocks Route. We're called blocks route because we route blocks and transactions. So blocks route is the infrastructure company. We propagate transactions and blocks really fast, basically at the speed of light. And it kind of started from my phd thesis in computer networks, where in 2010 or so, we're kind of like, oh, can we propagate blocks faster? Can we propagate transactions? And back then, these were the block size war days off. Bitchcoin. Maybe we can scale blockchains.
00:01:36.374 - 00:02:08.762, Speaker A: Maybe we can allow larger blocks, shorter time intervals if the information moves faster. That was the initial idea when blockchraft came out. And then fast forward to the DFI summer of 2020. All of a sudden, everybody is using our services because it's the DFI summer, and everybody wants to see everybody else's transaction. They want to front run them, they want to send it privately and not to be seen. They want to hear what's happening really fast and want their transaction to reach the miners really, really quickly. So all of a sudden, we became the go to infrastructure for anybody trading defi.
00:02:08.762 - 00:02:49.458, Speaker A: So we're not doing anything regarding scalability. We found product market fit then, and since then we've been very, very deep in DFI and in Mev. I think in the peak of the bull market, we were routing one and a half billion dollars of trade per day for our users. So that's something like 40% of all DFI on all the chains out there. So people use it for Ethereum and BSe and polygon and Salana. These are the kind of stuff I'm really a networking geek that had that idea how to send information really fast. And I was on my way, I was doing my phd and wanted to be a professor, but then like, oh, here's a cool idea, and it's a really promising product.
00:02:49.458 - 00:02:59.390, Speaker A: So find myself starting a company. Blockchain is like 50 people right now, and we're making millions of dollars per year, and it's successful. So that did not go how I planned.
00:02:59.470 - 00:03:12.330, Speaker B: Wow, super crazy. What were the early days of this? What did it look like? And what were the biggest hurdles within this journey? Because we all see the success, right? And it's like, oh, yeah, overnight success, but there's got to be some kind of struggle within this, right?
00:03:12.400 - 00:03:21.002, Speaker A: Oh, there's a lot of hurdle and difficulty along the way. Anybody who tell you the success stories just not tell you about all the stuff that didn't work well along the way.
00:03:21.056 - 00:03:21.466, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:03:21.568 - 00:03:39.410, Speaker A: Yeah. So there are two things, one on the personal and one on the ecosystem. I'll start like, ecosystem wise. And we started by doing one thing, sending information path and getting all the miners and mining pools to connect to us. And that was a lot like two years of work to get them connected. And then Defi became a thing. And everybody started using us.
00:03:39.410 - 00:04:15.338, Speaker A: Then flashbot came out and we're like, okay, is this competing with us? Is this supported for us? Turns out it was great for us. So we started running a flashbot relay, and all of a sudden, everybody who's anywhere between winter mute and jump to search or in a basement in Taiwan and anywhere in between, everybody started using us. Then the merge and the move to Pos and PBS came out, and we became an MEV relay. And we're also the small builder, we're provider. All the big builders are working with us. So really, things changed constantly in the ecosystem. We had a paid private transaction before even flashport existed.
00:04:15.338 - 00:04:35.454, Speaker A: Then we started to give it for free because everybody, people stopped want because they had other options. So on the ecosystem, things are constantly changing. Even people were now looking at the MeV landscape like, oh, we know where this is going. You have no idea where this is going. Things are changing drastically. Pos the merger happened like 15 months ago. Nothing is set in stone.
00:04:35.454 - 00:04:56.710, Speaker A: Everything is still moving in this landscape. And you have to be super nimble and open minded in this space to succeed. So that's kind of like on the ecosystem side, like challenges along the way. I think my favorite story in our second round, I think Pantera invested in us. I like pantera a lot. And they wanted to put a big check, 7 million. And I was like, oh, no, I'm not giving them that much equity.
00:04:56.710 - 00:05:15.370, Speaker A: I'll have higher valuation. I took five, no more than five. And then March 20 happened, and Covid. And this was before the. Everything came crashing, right? Stock market crashes, cryptocurrency. Everything crashes. And, like, wait, we have Runway for a year, tops.
00:05:15.370 - 00:05:34.066, Speaker A: I don't see any like, me. We had a round going. It failed. We didn't manage to raise anywhere close, not to the valuation nor the amount that we wanted. If we don't find a solution, I will have to fire 75 of the people in the company to continue going. Like, we can't go on this run. And this was a giant burden.
00:05:34.066 - 00:05:57.022, Speaker A: People I spoke with, and they left their job because I told them, join me in this journey. This is going to be awesome. This is going to be great. This is going to be a giant success. And they left their easy, steady job, and they joined blocks out, and they came up, okay. How can I even let them go? That's not a possibility. So then we had the bull market, and things turned out fine eventually, but these were hard months.
00:05:57.022 - 00:06:19.446, Speaker A: This is like, anywhere I go. This was at the back of my mind. If things don't turn around, I will have to fire everybody. And these are people that trusted me. I persuaded them to leave what they were doing, and joining me in this journey, it was a really hard decision. So the lesson I learned there, by the way, and anybody listening, always raise more capital. Don't count.
00:06:19.446 - 00:06:43.206, Speaker A: Oh, I'm getting too much equity. Our latest round in the previous bull market was led by Softbank. When I started it, we were basically cash flow balanced. So the amount that we were spending was basically that much. We went, and I had, like, $14 million at the bank I didn't need to raise. I know there's a bear market coming. I want a giant vortex so I can keep going.
00:06:43.206 - 00:07:02.178, Speaker A: Always raise more, raise more. And then when things don't go the way that you think they're going to go, then you're good. Don't make the mistake of rejecting money so not to over dilute yourself, et cetera. This is a lesson I learned the hard way. And I tell every first time founder that I see, make sure you raise more than you need.
00:07:02.264 - 00:07:09.910, Speaker B: It's agreed. You don't want to give away the equity, but in turn, if you don't have the capital, will never grow. And so it doesn't matter anyway. So it's always better.
00:07:09.980 - 00:07:25.802, Speaker A: It's exactly that. It's a bull market. I'm selling like an evaluation after throwing a number, $8 million valuation, but in two years it could be 800 million the value. Why would I sell it now? I should keep it and you keep that. And then the market changed. Nobody was expecting Covid. Covid hit.
00:07:25.802 - 00:07:37.514, Speaker A: There are drastic changes that you don't know where they're going to come. You don't know what the market is going to do. Make sure you have more than you need. Do not reject money. Worst case scenario. Okay. Your upside is slightly smaller.
00:07:37.514 - 00:07:38.362, Speaker A: Boohoo.
00:07:38.506 - 00:07:55.618, Speaker B: You mentioned proof of stake 15 months ago, and I believe you had a builder out as well in that time. And I wonder, did you eventually wind it down? I think today it's still running. Obviously not as competitive as the top three of Titan, Wintermere and Beaver build. I think it's at like zero point 12%.
00:07:55.704 - 00:08:19.222, Speaker A: We're really a service provider. We have a builder, but just so more than anything, so we could provide a few additional services. And eating your own dog food. Basically, if we don't run a builder, then we don't know what it's like to be a builder. So our builder has like 1% win rate or something like that. What we really do is work in collaboration with the builders out there. All the big ones are our partners.
00:08:19.222 - 00:08:44.334, Speaker A: Some of them are also among our investors, also some of the smaller ones. But definitely anybody who matters is in collaboration with us. What we really work on is providing better services for the validators, for the proposers, for the builders, for users, et cetera. If we wanted to make our builder better, we could have kept. We have some order flow, we give it to that, we don't give it to somebody else. It would have improved, but that's not our business. My business isn't being a builder.
00:08:44.334 - 00:08:55.314, Speaker A: Just like when I was doing more defi and less Mev, somebody else would be the best trader. My job is to give the infrastructure for all the traders. So I always like to be the house rather than a player.
00:08:55.362 - 00:08:57.682, Speaker B: It's like giving the shovels during a gold mine.
00:08:57.746 - 00:08:59.080, Speaker A: It's exactly that.
00:08:59.450 - 00:09:16.154, Speaker B: Speaking of gold mines, the relayer has got to be a gold mine of data, right? I never really knew this until recently, just because I've never experimented with relays. There's got to be some kind of edge you can acquire there. And funnily enough, there's not really any competition in relays either. You just have flashbots.
00:09:16.282 - 00:09:53.062, Speaker A: That is the absolutely wrong take. Okay, for the audience, what are relays? And just to keep everybody, like, on the same level, you have the validator, the proposer that can propose the next block, and you have all these block builders who want to offer it. Like, I build a block and it would pay him a dollar. You build a block, it would pay him two, somebody else would offer three, et cetera. And the proposer would, generally speaking, pick the one that pays it the most. But you have a problem of trust between them, right. If the builder would just give the validator the block, the value would say, oh, I could just unbundle the block.
00:09:53.062 - 00:10:27.890, Speaker A: I just let, like, it kept some money to yourself, I will take the entire thing. Or even worse than that, take sandwich bundles and then just unbundle them and just have their front running leg happen, and then steal their money with the back, et cetera. Sandwich the reaper later changed name to low carb. The crusader did an attack, which is basically that, okay. Like, it used a bug to achieve it. But basically, the validator potentially could wreck the builder, could direct the searcher. If you're lido or you're coinbase, you probably don't have an incentive to do it because you're playing a repeated game.
00:10:27.890 - 00:10:44.554, Speaker A: But if you're a sono validator, this is your single shot. Just steal $20 million and disappear into the sunset. Turn off the value. Like, who care? Even if you get. So the builder have a problem trusting the validator. The validator also have a problem trusting the builder. Okay.
00:10:44.554 - 00:11:05.858, Speaker A: If the builder just says, oh, sign this blindly, this would pay you a million dollars. And then he doesn't pay him a million dollars, promise this would pay you $100 million. Okay. The validator signed that. The builder actually don't pay him $100 million. It would actually take all the money to itself and disappear into the sunset. So you have this problem of trust.
00:11:05.858 - 00:11:53.498, Speaker A: And so relays are these trusted entities which sit in between. There's flashblops, there's floxroute, there's agnostic, and there's ultrasound, and also now istooth, which is a small one. And basically they act as, like, custodian is the right word for it, but basically as a trusted entity in between, get the block from the builder. The builder promised to pay some amount, give it to the validator to say, oh, it actually pays you the amount that it says without actually revealing. The validator signed it blindly, and the relay broadcast it into the network. So the relay sit in between it is just being trusted by both entities. And it does it for free and for no good reason, and just try to be a good actor for the good of the ecosystem.
00:11:53.498 - 00:12:23.142, Speaker A: And that is very unsustainable. And the reason that, wait, what? Because you were right, the relay has an edge. It could look what everybody are doing and outread everybody else. But if it did that, then it won't be a neutral relay. Builders would stop working with it. And so originally, no incentive was set in place for the relays, because you can't make relays that's got incentive compatible. The incentive for the relay is always, oh, just steal the money and disappear.
00:12:23.142 - 00:12:55.426, Speaker A: Take the best block from the best block builder, change it, promise stupid amount of money to the validator to sign it. The validator signs it and then just take the money and disappear. So because there wasn't a good solution for that, basically there was no incentive was set in place for the relays, which in my opinion is stupid and fragile. Okay, right now, it adds fragility to Ethereum. We have trusted entities, trusted entities in Ethereum, and they're building 93% of all blocks in theorem. I think people should be aware of.
00:12:55.448 - 00:12:57.302, Speaker B: It and say, like, is this crazy?
00:12:57.436 - 00:13:14.982, Speaker A: Yeah. So there isn't an edge. We're slightly different than that because we're an infrastructure company. So we actually send blocks faster and we improve latency. And we're the only relay, as far as I know, who actually can make money. Ultrasound, the largest relay. Bleed money agnostic.
00:13:14.982 - 00:13:40.514, Speaker A: Bleed money block native used to bleed money. Now they shut down the relay because Matt Katler, who I really like, said, it doesn't really make sense for us to subsidize the staking pools. Right? It's going to think all the validators think Lido, think Coinbase, think binance, think rocket pool. All of them. The validators make part of my language shitload of money. And it's going to, okay, we relay, subsidize it, and run infrastructure for like half a million dollars per know.
00:13:40.552 - 00:14:23.658, Speaker B: Speaking of validators making shit tons of money, I was looking at Lib Evm's cryptic woods, the leaderboard, and they recently added how much profit and tips and how much profit and tips that the validators and the builders are doing. And actually today, as of the 19 December, Titan tipped 204 e for 3.7 e profit, and that's for a total of 1690 blocks. And the validator for the day, they got 800 e of profit versus the builder profit of the day, 28.5. So it's a remarkable amount of money is going to the validators.
00:14:23.754 - 00:14:49.174, Speaker A: My job in this interview, or this conversation is to contradict you and disagree with you on everything. So let me take my counterargument with that. Validators don't make as much money from MeV as people think. Okay. Why? I just looked at the numbers two days ago or something validators make from MeV. Something like $300 million in 2023. $300 million.
00:14:49.174 - 00:15:18.686, Speaker A: For me, it's a lot of money, and for you it's a lot of money. And almost for everybody in the world, $300 million is a lot of money. But if you are all the validators with all the stake, and you have $60 billion worth of eth stake, then this adds your apY. It moves it from 4% to 4.4% APY. So this is 0.4% APY.
00:15:18.686 - 00:16:18.962, Speaker A: This is big money for anybody except for the Ethereum validators and specifically ethereum stakers. So I argue that MeV is actually smaller than people think. It isn't big money. Compared to the large bag of e that validators have, it only increases APY by less than half a percent. That's my contrarian point on that. And the follow up on if it's not that big of money, is to question, did we make the right decision by changing how ethereum works, by centralizing the block builders, by using trusted relay, because we were so afraid from the centralizing force of NeV? And at the end of the day, the centralizing force of MeV is less than half a percent of APY. Is it as big of a deal as we were making it to be? And I'm arguing that it isn't.
00:16:18.962 - 00:16:25.474, Speaker A: I think we made a giant mistake with PBS, and we made the wrong decision and we should maybe reconsider.
00:16:25.602 - 00:16:46.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of private transactions. I think it caused more harm than Good, even though the intentions were good. You mentioned your solution to this would be the validators will build the blocks and you would split profit 50 50 in some regard. I forgot how it was. But this was like a talk in Paris, I think.
00:16:46.612 - 00:17:20.578, Speaker A: Yeah. So I gave my talk in Paris on that, which the TLDR is. Validators could make more money instead of front running and extracting the most meV, they could actually make more money by being a service provider and provide real time pre confirmation. But before maybe going into that, let's understand why we did PBS. Okay. We knew block builders are going to be centralized, and we knew they're going to be an order flow, and we knew they're going to be trusted relays in the middle and we knew it's a bad thing. Nobody thought that private order flow is a good thing, instead of sending it to the mempo.
00:17:20.578 - 00:18:09.798, Speaker A: And nobody thought that it's a good thing that all the builders are centralized and that we use trusted entity in order to build blocks the argument, and I think Vitalik made it almost two years ago in the Nev salon in Vienna was, we know it's a bad thing, but we're intentionally choosing to do it because we don't want centralization. So the thinking before the merge was we don't want all the stake to go to the best validator who does the best mev and has the highest APY. The rationale was, if I have e, who do I give it to? The validator. That makes 4.1 Apy or 4.24.2, obviously. So the fear was that MeV would cause a centralization and all the stake would flow to the validator.
00:18:09.798 - 00:18:41.198, Speaker A: That makes the highest Mev and highest Apy, and that's really bad. So this is centralizing the validators, et cetera. So the idea was, maybe we can prevent this doom scenario. Maybe we can, instead of it say, listen, there's going to be economies of scale, they're going to be centralization. Let's make validators into dumb pipes. They would just get blocks from others and the centralization would only happen in the builder space. So builder would be centralized, but they would offer it to all the validators.
00:18:41.198 - 00:19:24.606, Speaker A: So prevent validator and stake centralization by containing the centralization in the builder space. That was the rationale. And at the time it sounded like a good idea. We don't want to centralize the validators, but it's been over a year since the merge and the move to Pos, and we see that the assumption that people would just move to the highest APY is wrong. In reality, it's just not true. Why? Coinbase base charges 25% of the yield from its stakers and it still has like, I think like 14% of the stake. People stake with Coinbase, despite they'll be making way more money somewhere else.
00:19:24.606 - 00:19:54.330, Speaker A: And why is that? Two reasons. One is because they trust Coinbase more than they trust others. Second, it's not that they're not smart, or they're idiots, or they're retail, so they don't know what's good for them. No, the average taker at Ethereum in a coinbase has something like $600 worth of heath. So if he moves it to somewhere else, it would cost him, let's say like $12 or something. It would cost him 2% opie's amount to move it to somebody else. And it would take like two years to break even.
00:19:54.330 - 00:20:20.782, Speaker A: Even if somebody else offers slightly higher apY, just the friction of moving it to somewhere else and staking it. So they're not dumb. It just doesn't make sense for them to move, which is why Coinbase can charge that no charges 10%. So if there are two groups, retail and institutions, you see that for sure. Retail is not going to where the highest APY is. They go to Coinbase because they trust it, or because they're already there. They go to Lido because they like the LST.
00:20:20.782 - 00:20:58.394, Speaker A: They go to basically everybody are charging between 5% and 25% off the yield. And people still use that. It just doesn't go to the highest APY. So that's like one group, that's the retail group. If you think about institutionals, then they actually care more about bips and like, okay, this one is slightly better, they will play that game, but a little about making a higher APY. They care much, much more about legal liability and visibility. So if you think about an entity, I'm just throwing an think Blackrock.
00:20:58.394 - 00:21:43.402, Speaker A: Blackrock takes it ease and says, okay, I'm going to stake it. You think Blackrock wants to run a validator which front run and backrun and sandwich users, and does all sorts of stuff which isn't necessarily clear from a regulatory perspective. Of course not. Blackrock would not extract Mev given the choice, because the slightly higher API nowhere nearly is good enough to push them to do that. Even think of Coinbase. Coinbase, who really, really like leading the charge for good defi and crypto and value, et cetera. You think their legal team is going to say, oh yes, it's fine that your validator front run and sandwich users, and you see this transaction no run vanilla.
00:21:43.402 - 00:22:18.022, Speaker A: So this initial assumption that all the stake would just go to whoever has the highest APY is wrong. Like it makes sense in know game theoretic model, which glazed over all the real world details. In reality, it doesn't happen. So we centralized builders and we added trusted relays, and we did all of that, and we introduced PBS to prevent a thing which isn't happening. We're seeing that stake isn't going to the highest APY. So I'm actually wondering if this was a mistake. I wonder if we wanted to do the right thing here.
00:22:18.022 - 00:22:42.910, Speaker A: But we over indexed on how smart we are and that we can predict how things will play out and things are playing out completely different. And so, back to the original point. How big is MEP? $300 million plus 0.4 APy less than half a percent. That's how big the centralization force off MEb. And I think this is something that people should kind of rethink.
00:22:43.490 - 00:22:46.826, Speaker B: Is that including sex decks or is that just Mev?
00:22:46.938 - 00:23:27.866, Speaker A: This is just like, if you look at leap ebm like dashboard, this is how much is actually being paid to the validator. This is how much money they're making. This is how much money blocks have paid them. This includes CFi Defi arbitrage, which from conversations with builders Frontier, and Stefan and Keith from Frontier, who I really like, wrote in their post that they think that Cfi defi arbitragers keep something like half of the value. I think that's a strong overestimation. Seeing some of the data and some of the other stuff around it, they pass something like 90% of the value to the validators. So CFI d five arbitrage are like, they have risk.
00:23:27.866 - 00:23:49.560, Speaker A: They won't necessarily, they obviously make a profit, but the profit isn't, oh, we keep half of the value. They pass along something like 90% of the profit of the value that they expect. If this numbers the 300 million per year is how much is actually being paid to the validators. So that's including everything. This is the amount being paid.
00:23:50.170 - 00:24:15.934, Speaker B: I think it's a good rationale if you think about it from an institutional point of view, they don't want to test the waters with being doing front running, back running sandwiching. From a legal point of view, it's just not good risk reward. Right? Whereas the retail keep switching to aprs, you're just paying a fee each time. And so you're eventually never going to get to the point of breaking even in a short amount of time.
00:24:15.972 - 00:24:16.126, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:16.148 - 00:24:39.990, Speaker B: The incentives are not there. So then it does make sense. But maybe it does change. If we did change it from the builders being centralized, and then a new game occurs, and then all these unexpected things happen again. You never know until you're in the game itself. We already predicted this stuff and it turns out to be not what we predicted at all. You never know until you're in the game.
00:24:40.060 - 00:25:14.510, Speaker A: I agree. So I think step one, which is like, oh, maybe we're not as smart as we think, okay, let's not over index on how smart we are and how we can predict how the future is going to be. I think that would be a good starting point. The model that says everything else being equal, stakers would move their stake to the validator. That makes the highest apy gladiators over optics, legal liability, cost and friction of moving the money and changing, et cetera. So putting that aside, like, okay, maybe our mental models aren't necessarily correct, and that's true for all of us. I don't know everything.
00:25:14.510 - 00:25:30.806, Speaker A: You don't know everything. I remember speaking with Ms. Alex at 2017 and he was kind of like explaining to me how light clients are just around the corner because it's a sole problem already. And it's kind of like it's a matter of eight months or something like that. And I love Vitalik. I think he's awesome. This is not a criticism of him.
00:25:30.806 - 00:26:13.438, Speaker A: It's kind of like nobody here knows what's going to happen in the future, how that's going to play out, right? We had plasma, we had all sorts of stuff, and we evolved over time. So let's not think that we know how things are going to play out. Let's not drastically change everything that we do in the decentralized and censorship resistant context based on what we think how things are going to play out. Now, going back to your earlier question, okay, Corey, smart hat. So what are you actually proposing? Step one is that grain of salt. Let's rethink if we know how things are going to play. Second thing is to point out again, the goal isn't to make all the validator make the same APY.
00:26:13.438 - 00:26:47.434, Speaker A: We don't centralize the block building and ethereum and add fragility. So the solo validator could make the same amount of money as Lido. It would be nice, but that's not the goal. The goal is to make it censorship resistant. If you have all sorts of gangs trying to steal money from travelers, you don't go around and say, well, you know, the small gangs aren't stealing as much money as the big gangs. Maybe we'll have like an organized professional group to steal money from the users and then distribute it equally so all the gangs, small and big, would get the same amount. This isn't the goal.
00:26:47.434 - 00:27:20.906, Speaker A: The goal is censorship, resistance and neutrality. And the only reason we introduced PBS was to prevent validator centralization. If this isn't happening, then we should rethink everything else. My third point, which goes back to your question, is, okay, so what do we do? I argue that Mev auction, it's not a zero sum, it's a negative sum game. Okay, when you do an auction, then validators, it maximizes the slice of pie that they extract. So you have an auction, and they extract the most value. That value isn't made of thin air.
00:27:20.906 - 00:28:15.114, Speaker A: It came from DeFi, lps and users losing money and getting sandwiched and crumbling and all these kind of things. If DeFi and users and lps bleed money, then DeFi is less useful, right? If I have a want to buy eth, I'm better off going and buying it on Coinbase than trying to buy it on Uniswap, because at Coinbase, I would get the current correct price. And on uniswap, if price goes up, my transaction would fail. If price goes down, by the time it executes, I would still pay the amount that I was willing to make. So the more value they extract, that value comes from DeFi, DeFi is less useful. So DeFi will have less activity and less liquidity, because people would stay in centralized finance in CFI, and the more they stay there and the less liquidity and activity there is less mev for the valuedators to capture. So this is a negative sum game.
00:28:15.114 - 00:28:31.578, Speaker A: The more mev they capture now, the less mev they're going to make to act in the future, because they keep DeFi a niche and not being capable of competing with DeFi, which in my mind is the end game. DeFi should compete with DeFi, not be this cartwheel running behind Defi.
00:28:31.674 - 00:29:01.958, Speaker B: The worst thing you can do. I was speaking to Josh from Aori, actually, about this, and if you think about Mev, right, and LP is, if I'm an MeV team, I'll do a JIt, right? So if I see someone doing a swap, I'll just dump in a bunch of money into that LP at that specific price. If it's v three, if it's v two, just dump it all in, and then you take out majority of the fees when they do the swap. And so the people that have been lping for, let's say months or weeks, right, have just been roped from someone that's been in there for one block.
00:29:02.054 - 00:29:30.494, Speaker A: So you're right for two reasons. One, if somebody makes a swap, then if that trade is a bad trade, then people would add liquidity. But if that trade is a good trade, people won't add liquidity in. Okay, so this is like just in time. Liquidity comes only when the user make wrong trades, trading in the wrong direction. They won't add liquidity and lose money helping somebody else. So this isn't like, oh, this helps all the users no, it helps only the user making bad trades.
00:29:30.494 - 00:29:47.190, Speaker A: That's 1 second, really. The lps who are there, they provide price discovery, but eventually all the fees go to whoever did the JIT, the just in time liquidity, because they're being used to discover price is being discovered through them, but they're not the one to actually benefit from the fees. So I agree with you.
00:29:47.260 - 00:29:52.394, Speaker B: Yeah, they're just getting completely wrecked. They're basically exit liquidity is what they're doing.
00:29:52.512 - 00:30:52.394, Speaker A: I agree. And so going back to like, okay, Uri, what are you offering? My vision, which needs to be proven still, is that can we have users pay lower fees, lps make more money, and validators make more money. And the way I see that is to exceed and not participate in MeV auctions, which again, it's kind of like an auction reaches a maximum, right? It's the slice of the pie off the validator, but it's a local maximum, it makes the pie smaller. Defi will never compete with Defi if it sucks, and it can provide better execution. And so my alternative to say, let's not have an auction, let's not reach a maximum point, but be bigger. Okay, so my thinking, my end game vision is, can a validator offer real time pre confirmation? Basically, all validators need to do is say like, oh, this is one, this is two, this is three, this is four. Think basically arbitrary sequencer who sees transaction, okay, this is what, just do this in real time.
00:30:52.394 - 00:30:54.782, Speaker A: And when the block comes, just actually do that.
00:30:54.836 - 00:31:09.218, Speaker B: But then if you're doing it instantaneous transactions, then you have the argument of equality, right? You just have this firm, right, they have the best compute in the world, best latency, and they have an insane edge over everyone else.
00:31:09.304 - 00:31:44.718, Speaker A: So here I agree. That's another contrarian argument here. Everybody hates hfts. Why do they hate HFT? Why are the higher frequency trading are so hated? Not because they correct the price, but because they front run. If I am the user and I have $1,000 and I want to buy ETh, I actually want high frequency traders to invest in their infra and trade really fast. So anytime the price moves, they correct it. Okay, so price goes up, but now it changes on Coinbase or on binance or somebody else, they are priced in one exchange, affect others.
00:31:44.718 - 00:32:19.638, Speaker A: And if defi was real time, it would also be equal in this game. But if price goes up, I want them to correct the price and be super fast. So when I make a trade, I don't have like seven monitors open in front of me, what's the price on Coinbase? What's it binance? I just want to send a trade and get the current correct price. I don't want to be faster than winter mute or jump or any of the others. I'm not trying to be pico like, I'm not trying to capture the pico second arbitrage opportunity. I just want to get whatever is the right price right now. So arbitrage groups are actually a good thing.
00:32:19.638 - 00:32:44.078, Speaker A: They correct the price. They make sure everybody, anywhere, any venue, you get the correct price, because if not, they would already capture the arbitrage. The reason people don't like them is exactly for what PBS calico normalizes. It's front running. Okay. If I'm about to buy eth, I don't want somebody else to say, oh, he's about to buy eth. Let me buy eth before he buys because he's going to move price up.
00:32:44.078 - 00:33:07.014, Speaker A: And now my trade gets a worse price, and then he sells after me just to capture. He bought it before I moved the price up, then he sold after I moved the price. And he makes using this sandwich capture some of the value. So HFTs suck. Not for doing arbitrage. Arbitrage is the good thing of their existence, and it's okay for them to make money. They should do that.
00:33:07.014 - 00:33:40.770, Speaker A: They should correct the price anywhere. The bad thing that the reason people hate them is because they're doing front running. And in the context of defi sandwiching, which all of a sudden, we're kind of like normalizing and say, oh, this is fine, it's okay. It's part of how the system works. So, to your point, if we have equality, then I want all the arbitragers and I want all the HFTs to work and try to correct the price. So users who aren't arbitragers can send a trade, and anywhere it executes, it gets to the value. They say, oh, this is one, this is two, this is three, this trade is next.
00:33:40.770 - 00:33:45.218, Speaker A: And that will always, always have the correct price. Does that make sense?
00:33:45.304 - 00:34:03.290, Speaker B: Yeah. The thing is, sandwiching, if you're a user, you don't really know about slippage or any of the stuff if you're just retail. But like the other day, I was shitcoining, and I purposely set my slippage to zero so I wouldn't get sandwiched in a public membo. And I don't know if I did. I didn't check. But if there's no slippage, we'll see.
00:34:03.360 - 00:34:39.262, Speaker A: There's nothing to abuse, but let's talk about it. You send the trade, there are three things that could happen. You send the trade and will execute in like 6 seconds or 8 seconds or two when the next block is mined or when it gets to the block builder, and the block builder gives it to the relay and the Gilbert block. But within a few seconds, if you said slippage is zero, I want this price, and price goes up. Your transaction failed, okay? You just paid, and if this is ethereum, then you actually paid a lot for it. So you send your transaction, so it fails, and you just spent money on that. If price goes down, on the other hand, you're still going to pay the price you are willing to pay.
00:34:39.262 - 00:35:03.806, Speaker A: Okay, if fees go down and say, oh, this guy is willing to buy it at $1,000. Price already just dropped to $900. I'll sell it to him for 1000. Right? I'll buy it at 900. So you're going to pay that amount. And if you're going to try and prevent the transaction from reverting, then you're going to add a bit of slippage, because price moved just a tad. I'm still willing to do it, at which point you just signed off yourself.
00:35:03.806 - 00:35:24.222, Speaker A: I will accept this price no matter what. You'll get that worth execution price. So it's not just retail or dumb. No retail, unless you can see the future. Like, okay, I know what the price is going to be in 6 seconds. Then you have no choice. You're choosing between adding slippage and paying higher, and taking the chance of your trade just faded.
00:35:24.222 - 00:35:45.562, Speaker A: And so you go to some, you're shitcoining super volatile. I don't know, it's bonk on Solano or something like that. Okay. Like, it moves up, it moves out or mobile, any of these, I don't know. What's the correct price? Like, it depends on the millisecond. It really is changing really, really fast. It is impossible for me to set it to the right slippage and say, what's the price? I just want the current correct price.
00:35:45.562 - 00:35:56.922, Speaker A: Whatever is the price right now, I want that, which is why I like arbitrage. I forget the trigger. Their job is to correct it at any point. So when my trade comes, I know they already captured the arbitrage.
00:35:56.986 - 00:36:15.026, Speaker B: I wonder what it would look like if we had the private transactions by default. And when they're sent to the mempool, all you see is the value of eth, basically. So then the block builders can still order them, but then they don't know what the transactions are to abuse it. I wonder if that would be an interesting game.
00:36:15.128 - 00:36:49.386, Speaker A: So let's say a few things here. Private transaction. As somebody who provides private transaction and provided private transaction before flaspot existed, like mid 2020, we were the first to do it one inch, were the first big consumer facing company to use our service to offer to users to avoid front running. Private transactions suck. Basically the model is I would give it to you guys, and I trust you not to screw us over. Okay, so you could be blocksworth, you could be the builders, you could be something else. And the entire point was to remove of crypto and Defi is to remove intermediaries.
00:36:49.386 - 00:37:15.174, Speaker A: The entire point is not to have to rely on them, including blockstock. Okay. We make a lot of money off all these things, and I still think it's a bad thing. And so private transaction isn't just like great utility or something. Oh, I just give it to flaspot and I trust them not to front run me the alternative for that to say, okay, let's do encrypted transactions. Okay, threshold. Basically, you propagate transactions, you don't know what's in them.
00:37:15.174 - 00:37:46.186, Speaker A: And then after they are kind of like confirmed, et cetera, then they'revealed after the fact. Once majority of key holders agree to reveal them. The downside of something like that. Who's doing that? I'm thinking scroll, but I want whisper blacking on the name. Just three potential downsides of it is, okay, now, MeV extractors, nobody knows the order. So just spam transaction, try to capture arb by just statistically you might be making money out of that. So just spam the network with trying to capture Arb.
00:37:46.186 - 00:38:02.466, Speaker A: And maybe you're send a lot of them and some of them would land somewhere. That makes sense. So that's one bad thing. Second bad thing is that, as I said earlier, I actually want arbitrage to correct the price. So when I send my trade, I don't get the worst. Again, I'm a user. I'm not an arbitrator.
00:38:02.466 - 00:38:18.650, Speaker A: I just want. Of course, oh, yes, of course. I want to buy e set a dollar. But I'm not getting that right. I want to just get the current correct price. I don't want to get screwed over. I'm not asking for any special treatment somehow to get a lower price, but I do want to get the current correct price.
00:38:18.650 - 00:39:03.090, Speaker A: If arbitragers can't correct the price, they don't know when this thing is happening. Then when my trade executes, I don't get the current correct price, I get what used to be the price. Maybe price went up since then, maybe price went down since then, but I'm not going to get whatever is the current correct price. So that's another thing that you lose in doing something like encrypted mempool. And the third thing is, in my view, the role of Defi is to compete with DeFi, okay? It needs to be at least as good if you want people to be capable or large entities to trade on Defi. Saying something like, well, you make a trade and you don't know what price you're going to get. But then a bit afterwards, you'll know what transact executed and then you'll know the price.
00:39:03.090 - 00:39:30.414, Speaker A: And if you're like, I don't know, a hedge fund that have to be like Delta, you can't make trades and not know what price are they going to happen and know about afterwards, right. You have to kind of make transaction in tandem. I'll sell this asset and I buy that asset to hedge. And all these kinds of, you can't have stuff that you do. Adding this additional latency makes defi less useful and b, making less useful, less capable of competing with CFi. So encrypting the transaction has its own cost to utility.
00:39:30.542 - 00:39:38.818, Speaker B: I think it might just be better off to be on the roll ups and other chains like Aztec. I think those are pretty interesting. I wonder how they'll really progress.
00:39:38.914 - 00:40:17.650, Speaker A: If you move to an l two. You have two types of l two. You have an l two that using like a single sequencer, like arbitrarium, or you could have a committee, right, and be decentralized. If it is a single sequencer, let's say this, it's a us entity, and tomorrow there is a war with Russia or with China or something like that. And the DOJ, whoever knocks on you and say, you're not allowed to touch any wallets, which, here's a giant list, these are all chinese or russian citizens, related, they're ofAc, do not touch them if you do, 30 years in jail if you do that. So it's a rollout. They could still just trade on l one.
00:40:17.650 - 00:40:37.926, Speaker A: They were just off boarded, so they can't use the l. The l two fallback is not to exist and not to provide the utility, but it isn't censorship resistant, providing this thing that we're trying to build here. So if you have just a centralized sequencer, I'm not sure what you're getting. If you have a committee, you have exactly the same problem. How is that different from an l one?
00:40:38.028 - 00:40:54.566, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. I think Salana kind of solves the problem in a way, because it is significantly cheaper than Ethereum and faster, and it is an l one. But when people think about crypto, they think about Ethereum or bitcoin, they really think about Salana.
00:40:54.598 - 00:41:26.390, Speaker A: I agree. Solana has a lot of proving still to do, et cetera, but they're basically trying to achieve that. Also, I really like the Jito team. Jito is doing something similar to flashbot, very similar to Flashbot, and I like Buffalo, and I like the team, and I really like them, and I hate their product. They have the staking product, which I admire, and I think it's super cool and kind of like, okay, let's have all that happening on chain. It's super cool. But their idea to MEP, and I told them that, I told Lucas, this breaks the value proposition.
00:41:26.390 - 00:42:15.734, Speaker A: Solana, if Solana is aspire and again, needs to be proven, needs not to halt. It's nowhere as mature and stable as we want it or people want it to be. But if you have these fires and you have fire dancers, a new client, and it spits out, I don't know, 1000 or 10,000 transactions, but then every important transaction that touches beef, put it on hold, send it to an auction, have the auction wait for, like, I don't know, 1.2 seconds to the less shred off the block, off the last block in the sprint, and then try to front run, back run. If you bring all this, pardon my, if you bring all this shit to Salana, what did Salana achieve, really? Right. If they're going to do exactly the same thing, then that's not going to be a useful d five ecosystem. Because if I want to trade, you have Phoenix, which is like an order book.
00:42:15.734 - 00:42:30.620, Speaker A: And okay, I want to buy, I want to sell. But if all my trade first go to somebody who gets a peek at it and can front run and back run and whatnot to it, then it's a dancing. So I hope they do something better than the mev option on Solana. I think there are better options out.
00:42:31.790 - 00:42:53.874, Speaker B: It's just, it's such a hard problem. But if you do crack it, then it kind of changes everything. But there's also the underlying, if it did all work, it's still not the same as CFI, because you have the underlying risk of getting, if you're staking, let's say, or lp into a protocol, that protocol could have a vulnerability, and that's inherent risk of the code.
00:42:54.072 - 00:43:29.758, Speaker A: So let's separate the two things here. I agree and disagree with you. So first thing, the first argument here is, forget about cracking the problem. Forget maybe Uri doesn't have a good solution. But the first part is, should we change how, or were we right to change how Ethereum works and how blockbuilding works, and centralized blockbuilding and use trusted relay and all of that to prevent stake going to the highest APy validator and ruin Defi and play this negative sun game? And then we're kind of like, well, you know what, in retrospect, stake doesn't go there. So we did all of that kind of like for nothing. That's one thing.
00:43:29.758 - 00:44:34.580, Speaker A: Even if I don't have a better solution, maybe not having a solution is potentially better. Okay, the point number one is, do we want Ethereum to be decentralized and censorship resistant? Which is achieved, it achieves by being decentralized, right? If you have validators all around the world, and they're not limited by a single jurist or four entities of relays, or, I don't know, twelve builders or something like that. So that's one point. Even without solving it, were we right to change how Ethereum worked to solve this nonexisting problem? In my opinion, no, obviously. But I think people should be aware of it, should think about it, definitely, before we enshrine this thing. The second thing is like, okay, what can we do? And what is a solution for that? And can defi compete with Defi? So I'm a giant defi bull, okay? And my favorite story about Defi and why I think it's valuable is that when I was in, again, Pantera name comes up in Pantera summit 2019. There was the former head of the CFTC, and he was telling the story how in 2008, during crisis, he was at the White House.
00:44:34.580 - 00:45:04.810, Speaker A: Leevan Brother is about to crash. They all sit there and they have to decide whether to save Lehman brother or to let it crash. And they look and they're like, well, we actually have enough money to prevent Lehman Brothers from crashing, and we can save maybe two more or three more. But if there are like 20 such banks out there, we can't save them. We'll use our bullet to save something. And then target is going to crash anyway. And they had to reach a decision whether to save Lehman brother or let it crash.
00:45:04.810 - 00:45:46.742, Speaker A: And as you know, they did let it crash. 2008, subprime crisis, everything around it, giant global economic catastrophe. And then like four years later, they end up thumbing the books, because each one of the banks have a different book, and they each have these weird ask, like, okay, I have mortgages, then I put them together, then I slice them, then I sell it to other banks who take them and smoosh them together, and then make that into slice and sell to others. So they're all holding some part of financial instruments off one another. And then it took them, like four or five years to look up all the numbers. They're like, oh, you know what? There are, like, two banks, like, that. They could have prevented the entire 2008 financial cris.
00:45:46.742 - 00:46:24.422, Speaker A: They had the funds, but they didn't have clarity. They didn't have insight into how these banks, how much they actually have and don't have. Now, this information, this isn't like a business secret or that. This is public information. Regulators have it very spread across 30 different systems, each one different, and et cetera. And so if banks were on DeFi, the global financial system is on a thing which is completely transparent. And you actually know, we're saying that by itself is of immense value, that people don't understand this company.
00:46:24.422 - 00:47:11.046, Speaker A: Is it okay? Is it not okay? What are actually holding all this? Even things like SVB, right? Like the silicon, like banks falling and et cetera. If that information was out there, and it should already be out there, just like not very accessible, then that by itself is extremely valuable. Having a single global, always on permissionless financial system for the world, for me, is the reason to get up in the morning, the reason that we're trying to make crypto, the reason that we do all that we do, and we work on it, and we're so excited. So is there a smart contract risk? For sure, there are a million other risks. We're still building it, right? People make Ach transfers and then it gets lost. Kind of like how mail get lost. They don't know where the packet went, and they don't know where the money is.
00:47:11.046 - 00:47:29.158, Speaker A: Okay. That doesn't also work. Then they have to pick up the phone and call other banks, figuring out where the money went. So is a system perfect and ready for production, for global use? Of course not. But that doesn't mean that it's not valuable or that it's less valuable than CFI in any way, in my opinion.
00:47:29.254 - 00:47:33.322, Speaker B: No, I 100% agree. I super hate banks, with my experience with them.
00:47:33.376 - 00:48:02.194, Speaker A: I don't know if you run a company, but the simple thing that if I have money and I want to send it, then I can, is a thing I can do in crypto, and I can't do with banks. It's kind of like, oh, I'm abroad and I'm trying to use my credit card and keep, oh, this is potentially a fraud, and I'm in a different country. This is how I pay for stuff, and I have to figure it out or I want to make a transfer. Oh, it's a big transfer. You need to come into the bank and stand in line and spend an hour. Like, if you're speaking with investors and entities and et cetera. The value of something like USDC is immense.
00:48:02.194 - 00:48:12.300, Speaker A: Just how would you send something? I sent it anywhere immediately. Done. Do not underestimate how valuable and what a giant product market fit this has.
00:48:12.750 - 00:48:29.230, Speaker B: Oh, no. I was sending money to buy from Australia, and four months later, or six months later, they hold my account and give me, like, a 15 question document to unlock my account. I'm like, what? I've been using you guys for years.
00:48:29.300 - 00:48:30.318, Speaker A: What is this?
00:48:30.484 - 00:48:36.286, Speaker B: I was paying rent. Guys, come on. It was just like a giant doc, just to unlock my account.
00:48:36.388 - 00:49:13.786, Speaker A: In 2015, I moved here from Israel to the US, and I did my phd here, and me and my wife bought a condo. And so to put, like, a down payment, I needed to transfer money from Israel to here. And then I don't know if you know it, but in the US, when you start a contract, you need to pay some it. If you fail to put that amount, then you lose the good faith, or I don't even remember the term for that. I was that close to lose money because the money didn't arrive in time, because my bank in Israel was kind of like, wait, you're moving that money to us? How come? And they're calling me, but when they call me, it's the middle of the night, I miss the conversation. Then it's the weekend. The weekend here is not the same as the weekend there.
00:49:13.786 - 00:49:33.090, Speaker A: It took me, like, I don't know, five days to solve it. And I was so close to losing my honest money, or whatever it's called, because it just took me so long to transfer. And these weren't even that big of sums. Like, let's say, I think it was, like, under 100k. Okay, like, big money, definitely for me. Definitely then. But not like, oh, I'm moving $10 million.
00:49:33.090 - 00:49:39.654, Speaker A: No, one hundred k to buy a house somewhere else. And it only cost me quite a lot. Yeah.
00:49:39.692 - 00:50:01.374, Speaker B: I was just trying to get money out of my bank in Dubai, and it took them two months to even enable the withdrawal, and that was ridiculous. And I still haven't got it. It's been like four months now, so it's just kind of just still there and I can't touch it, which is insane to me. They want me to go into the country to the specific branch to get it out.
00:50:01.412 - 00:50:16.966, Speaker A: I'm like, what? Every time you interact with trunk and like, oh, you know, what we're making here is actually is valuable. That at least has been my experience. Every time you have to actually do something and you're like, oh, wait, yes, this is terrible. This system suck.
00:50:17.098 - 00:50:32.402, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that's super bad. The future is definitely going to be a mixture of AI, crypto and robotics. It's just going to be the money of the world eventually. It's just the system right now is just so inefficient. I don't want to live in that world of banks.
00:50:32.546 - 00:50:33.890, Speaker A: I totally mad.
00:50:33.970 - 00:50:45.642, Speaker B: It's just time consuming and too much tape to go through just to get your money out. It's ridiculous. Like, it's your money, you should be able to move it instantly, right? It seems like a given, but apparently it's not.
00:50:45.696 - 00:50:52.378, Speaker A: Yeah, if I can send an email somewhere and if I could send a text somewhere, I could probably send money. It literally bits. It's the same thing.
00:50:52.464 - 00:51:03.314, Speaker B: I feel like it is all a game though, because it is the business for them. And so they want to keep your money as possible. They make it way harder, which is understandable from their point of view.
00:51:03.432 - 00:52:02.686, Speaker A: I remember speaking with a director at Mastercard a while ago, really like a few years ago, and he was kind of like, do you think it doesn't really cost them that much money to make a transfer? Percentile of cents, obviously, because if it could be cheap to be done on chain, it's much cheaper to do it like in the centralized setup. And so most of the money and all the fees that they're taking, a, they need to make a profit, b, a significant amount is also okay, like fraud protection and whatnot. Because depending on the country, they lose money on that. But the biggest thing is, okay, they will charge 3% from the retail and then pass 2% as cash back or something like that to the retail user. So the retail user like, oh, I make a trade and I get 2% discount anywhere I go. So most of the value is passed back to the retail. So each feel like it's cheaper, but then prices increase because now everything is now 3% more costly.
00:52:02.686 - 00:52:24.570, Speaker A: But it keeps that network effect. If I buy something with a credit card, then I get 2% back. If I buy it in a different way, then I'm not getting that 2% back. So I am very incentivized to do that. It is extremely cheap for the existing traditional to actually make payments, payments. It's not costly. Anyway, that's my rent on that.
00:52:24.640 - 00:52:25.670, Speaker B: We hate banks.
00:52:25.750 - 00:52:29.994, Speaker A: Tldo every time I go there, I remember why.
00:52:30.112 - 00:52:43.534, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just like PTSD every time I step foot into a bank. In terms of defi, if someone wanted to get into the relay game, man, what do you mean? Obviously you're already kind of dominating.
00:52:43.662 - 00:53:19.430, Speaker A: We're really dominating as a service provider. Our bin business is to work with builders and work with BSE valid and work with Ethereum validators and offer them more features and all these kind of. That's our real business. We do a relay because it's a good. Again, we're the only entity that actually can make charge money on that. And we have partnership with builders to capture some of the value because if they don't use us, they make less money. So it's kind of like, okay, it's easy for us to capture that because we spent the last five years building infrastructure for that purpose.
00:53:19.430 - 00:54:01.954, Speaker A: And so there's no business currently in being a relay. So if you want to do something cool, go try to be a builder, go try to be a searcher. I'm not sure if the thing that you want to do is be a relay that offered services for free and try to be nice for everybody and kind of help facilitate the trades, et cetera, and not get paid for it. So that's what I would tell people, I think don't understand how that relays aren't a business in most cases. Again, we are, because relay is a thing that we do to support everything else that we do. The other relays just bleed money. Think about like one hundred k per year off cost, plus two engineers.
00:54:01.954 - 00:54:17.438, Speaker A: DevOps says this need to be super high performance, blah blah, blah blah blah, half a million per year. So if you're thinking about it, you can recoup. Maybe you should speak with the relay first. Go speak with Justin, go speak with Martin, go speak with Max for my. I'm not sure they'll tell you. It's a smart business move, man.
00:54:17.524 - 00:54:20.410, Speaker B: You think it's one hundred k to run a relay?
00:54:20.570 - 00:54:49.226, Speaker A: A, yes, b, think about this is a high performance server that connected to get bit. Everybody keep hammering it to get what is the highest, latest bit. So it has like the real cost is sending traffic outside. So you keep sending messages outside. And then when somebody signs it, then you broadcast the block and you try to make as fast as possible, et cetera. So this just means that's it.
00:54:49.328 - 00:54:53.462, Speaker B: It's basically high frequency trading without the profit.
00:54:53.526 - 00:55:14.386, Speaker A: It's high frequency traders, but you subsidize the large validators that has $60 billion worth of. So they make a slightly higher apy. That's the system. Which is a reason, again, Matt Cutler took like block native and they weren't running out of money. They're fine, and they're a good team and they're super smart. This is a terrible. This is not even a business.
00:55:14.386 - 00:55:26.690, Speaker A: Okay? It's kind of like, why would we do that? Not even talking about, like, OFAC and censorship resistance, which is like an entire can of worms that potentially require discussion.
00:55:27.510 - 00:55:47.354, Speaker B: When you think about it, though, if everyone's partnering with you, then it's just an even playing field, right? If everyone's partnered and they all have the same deal, the searches that don't have are using you, then they just lose. But the people that are, it's just kind of a de facto standard. So they need to find an edge somewhere else. Right. It's kind of what I'm getting at this.
00:55:47.392 - 00:56:03.390, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's the interesting thing. Think about builders are CFI DeFi arbitragers because these are the dominating ones. Tight list, though. So they win when there's less CFi defi Arb. But when CFi defi aRb, other than it's Rsync and Beaver are the big winners. Basically.
00:56:03.390 - 00:56:40.886, Speaker A: Think about it. Think that Beaver has a block that pays $100 and Rsync has a block that pay $100. If one of them get one additional transaction, it doesn't even have any mev in it. Okay? This transaction that somebody sent an NFT to somebody else and it pays, sent to the validator for fee for their priority, then whoever has that, if the other entity doesn't have it, then he would win. Not because of mev, just because of access to order flow. So all the block builders are working, number one on being C by DeFi, arbitrarily and good at it. But the second thing is getting order flow.
00:56:40.886 - 00:57:10.546, Speaker A: So this entire thing becomes like, how could I get private order flow from everybody? So this is what they're working on, trying to get the most private order flow, especially exclusive one, because it gives them an advantage compared to the other ones. And again, this is not the DeFi removing intermediaries, which I want to see in the world. I don't know that that's a good thing we're doing. Fine. We're doing great. But we did fine before Pos. We did fine before flashbot.
00:57:10.546 - 00:57:25.430, Speaker A: We did find before Meb, and we'll be fine afterwards, because people would need low latency connectivity to hear about price changes to send. Like, I'm not worried about us, but if I'm telling where I want Defi and crypto to go, I'm not sure we're heading in the right direction.
00:57:25.510 - 00:57:44.894, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. Okay, let's say they wanted to spin up their own relay. Then let's say they were like, okay, we don't want to pay for your services. We can do it ourselves. And so nobody even chooses them as a relay, and they're doing 2% of an entire network. I mean, they can still get all the mem pools, right? If there was a good, let's say.
00:57:44.932 - 00:58:00.018, Speaker A: You'Re an mev team, why would you run a relay instead of sending it to ultrasound or really nice people and perhaps 30% of the hash rate? And it's kind of like, why would you pay half a million dollars worth per year on setting up a relay?
00:58:00.114 - 00:58:13.642, Speaker B: Well, if you could make a faster one than the fastest one out there, right, then sure, no one would send you anything, but at least you can get everything quicker than everyone else, and maybe you wouldn't even know that. It's just not business.
00:58:13.776 - 00:58:38.274, Speaker A: So instead of that, you could say, go to the validator. Is that really a relay? Right. The relay sit between the builder and the validator. Just like, oh, ask the validator to connect to the builder. The biggest Bb hurdle in a relay is to get to the validators for them to be like, okay, let's connect and get it going. I was speaking with Justin Drake about like, oh, maybe an idea to improve relay. Oh, we could do that.
00:58:38.274 - 00:59:04.070, Speaker A: And I was talking, maybe we launch another relay to do this feature. If we do it, we improve our existing relay. I'm not going and try to persuade, and this is Justin Drake, okay? I'm not going to try to persuade all the validators out there to try to connect with me. It's such a giant headache. And so the dD hurdle. But if you run a relay, you need to get connected to everybody, blah, blah, blah, et cetera. If you want the speed, don't run it through a relay.
00:59:04.070 - 00:59:25.390, Speaker A: Okay? Send it directly from your builder to them. That's the centralization force that we're seeing. If you have a centralized builder, it could pick up the phone to Coinbase, to Lido, to where? Connect directly to me and I will send you faster and you'll get something. The centralization for that we're seeing was sent PBS, and I'm not sure it's a good thing.
00:59:25.460 - 00:59:33.666, Speaker B: I remember seeing on your website that you basically get all of the mem pools to exist and you aggregate it and send it off to whoever connects with you.
00:59:33.688 - 00:59:33.874, Speaker A: Right?
00:59:33.912 - 00:59:38.014, Speaker B: Or it does an exclusive deal, pays your services. Do you have to be a relayer.
00:59:38.062 - 01:00:12.526, Speaker A: To do that, though? No, our main business, think about we have a network of servers which list them to the peer to peer network. And every time we hear a transaction or a block, we propagate it super fast to everybody else. We did that before being a relay. You could come and try to compete with us, but you should be very well capitalized, have a big team, we have a few years of advantage. I joke that the only competition I really care about is Amazon and Google and Cloudflare. Okay? Like tier one networking infrastructure company, global infrastructure company. If we make millions per year, they don't really care.
01:00:12.526 - 01:00:39.378, Speaker A: If we make tens of millions of dollars, they start to care when we make like hundreds of millions. Okay? Then they'll come and compete with us. But my end is imagine ten years into the future, DFI is as big as CFI. Then tier one networking companies will try to provide services to send information back. Because this is a financial infrastructure for the world. I currently have a network effect and I could win. But I like Cloudflare as an example.
01:00:39.378 - 01:01:18.194, Speaker A: I can't compete on speed with Cloudflare and their, I don't know, 1200 engine years who are focusing on putting infrastructure in the ground, et cetera. So eventually I'll see myself working with them. But this is another, like, if you're in crypto, you think nobody owns, there's AWS and there's Google Cloud, and there is an infrastructure and your Internet service provider. And you should be very much aware that these are entities that have power. This isn't happening in a vacuum. You should know there is infrastructure under you. And DeFi should be built in a way to be resistant for any one of them to try to tamper with it.
01:01:18.194 - 01:01:45.274, Speaker A: So like, I offer real time services, whatnot, et cetera, almost at the speed of light. I don't want anybody ever to rely singularly on me. I love the peer to peer network because it's resilient and robust. We're an enhancement to the peer to peer network. I mean, connects to the peer to peer network, also connect to me. And in 99.9% I will send you information faster, but always connect also to the peer to peer network, because that's the D five superpower.
01:01:45.274 - 01:01:49.902, Speaker A: That's the thing that's extremely hard to compete with. Does that make sense?
01:01:50.036 - 01:01:52.910, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Interesting. Yeah.
01:01:52.980 - 01:01:53.358, Speaker A: Okay.
01:01:53.444 - 01:02:01.394, Speaker B: That makes sense. That's a really powerful value proposition that you've kind of bundled all up into the relay as well.
01:02:01.512 - 01:02:27.974, Speaker A: I agree. But again, we did that before a relay was a thing. I would be more than happy to have to figure out a different business model on how to monetize what we do, et cetera, et cetera. If it means that DeFi is kicking ass in competing with DeFi, I'm sure we'll find that. I'm not worried. I want DeFi to be useful. I don't want it to be like this sidecard, running behind CFI and being used for everything with kind of like, again, being a niche.
01:02:27.974 - 01:02:30.358, Speaker A: I want DFI to compete with DeFi.
01:02:30.454 - 01:02:49.106, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. I see your point of view. That's interesting. Well, I hope it all goes well for D five, because I really don't want to work with banks permanently. I want to be the bank equivalent in just DFI. We'll see in due time, a couple more bull runs, and hopefully we'll be all right.
01:02:49.208 - 01:03:04.722, Speaker A: Hopefully this will be in the right trajectory. DeFi is getting better. Okay. DeFi, usability, the UX, both wallets are getting better, protocols are getting better, and. Yes, and especially new protocols. Yes. They need to all be battle tested and really hard and et cetera.
01:03:04.722 - 01:03:18.090, Speaker A: If you tried to use DFI three years ago, it was much, much worse. And if you tried, like what? Kind of like in 2020. Okay, that's kind of like three, three and a half years ago, it was really hard just to figure out what it looks like.
01:03:18.160 - 01:03:41.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope it all gets better and it will over time, as long as things keep going in the way they've been gone. But I think this has been very useful, and I've never really gone deep into relays and stuff like this, so I'm very thankful for being able to spend time with you, and I'm sure we'll talk again soon in the future, hopefully when banks are eliminated.
01:03:41.710 - 01:03:46.446, Speaker A: Yes. Thank you for having me and allowing me to rant all my unpopular opinions.
01:03:46.558 - 01:03:48.850, Speaker B: Of course, anytime. Do it again.
01:03:49.000 - 01:04:08.870, Speaker A: I'm sure a lot of people hearing this, and some people I really like, again, we talked about earlier before the call, talked about Stefan, one of the co founders, have since left. We disagree completely. I love the guy. I think he's a great guy. I think he was wrong in et cetera. So a lot of good people. We've listened to that and might think I'm completely off, but that's also okay.
01:04:08.870 - 01:04:15.134, Speaker A: We should take our own opinions with a giant grain of salt. Let's not pretend that we know how things are going to play.
01:04:15.252 - 01:04:15.726, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:15.828 - 01:04:16.142, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:16.196 - 01:04:20.430, Speaker B: It's just at least getting the word out there to even have it in thought.
01:04:20.580 - 01:04:22.926, Speaker A: Cool. They got you. So thanks for having me.
01:04:23.028 - 01:04:30.110, Speaker B: Of course, yeah. Thank you so much, Lori, for coming on, and I'm sure we'll talk again soon, but until then, thank you so much, and take care.
01:04:30.180 - 01:04:30.700, Speaker A: Thanks, man.
