00:00:00.410 - 00:00:22.480, Speaker A: People believe that shared sequencing will bring crosschain atomicity, and it's true because you share the same sequencer. But we can take this a step further. If we have the mempools of multiple different rollups and you express this intention somewhere, we can pull you into a mempool match and be able to facilitate crosschain atomicity. If there is a commitment layer, anything is possible.
00:00:23.170 - 00:00:56.430, Speaker B: Scraping bits is brought to you by the following sponsors. Fastlane Labs Trustless Mev mev protocol maximize your eth staking value with me v e exclusively on MeV IO and composable execute any intent on any chain. Coming soon to manchis app that is M-A-N-T-I-S-A-P gm gm. Everyone, my name is Higacy, the host of scraping bits, and today I'm with Omar Zaki, aka Branjar from composable. How's it going?
00:00:56.580 - 00:00:58.062, Speaker A: Good, man, thanks for having me.
00:00:58.116 - 00:01:13.618, Speaker B: Thanks for coming on. You know, we spent the past two days in Dubai together. Now you're in Turkey without me, but that's fine, we're just going to go along with this. But man, just for the people that aren't familiar with you, I know a lot of people listen on Ethereum and who are you and what do you do?
00:01:13.784 - 00:02:04.858, Speaker A: Yeah, so we have been focusing a lot on IBC, so trust minimized. Bridging since 2021. We started out trying to bring polka dot, now bringing Cosmos and IBC to Ethereum and Salana and several other ecosystems. Our focus has really always been how do you replicate kind of this DTCC dark pool, best execution vibe that you see very apparent in the equities market to crypto. And a lot of different people strategize all these different ways to do so. But for me, I really believe that crosschain is the way to unlock this. So I think we've really tried to position composable as a protocol that has developed solid interoperability technology that can sustain multi billion dollars of volume per day because it's trust minimized.
00:02:04.858 - 00:02:14.306, Speaker A: On top of this, develop order flow orchestration mechanisms to distribute it in a sort of chain agnostic, volume driven manner.
00:02:14.498 - 00:02:48.466, Speaker B: The biggest things we see right now with cross chain is well, how do you first bring all this money from one chain to another? And the only solutions are just bridges. Quite recently, depending on your definition, recently. So you're highly relying on these chains and especially two or three years ago, the Bronin bridge hack with Axio Infinity, that was like 600 mil or something. Bridges are just highly critical infrastructure, but also very unique and so there's no standard for security, and they tend to be a giant target. So are you guys relying on these bridges or you're building your own? What's the game plan for that?
00:02:48.648 - 00:03:38.846, Speaker A: When we started on this journey of essentially trying to create a best execution API for anything, right? So for swaps, like anything you want to do in the crypto ecosystem, we want to be able to facilitate it. And I don't think we really started thinking that we were going to build interoperability solutions. I think we just ended up realizing that we needed to because everything was so shit. Like the standard way to bridge is basically just say, trust me, bro. And then people basically just take this trust me, bro concept and extrapolate it to different models. Like, model number one is validators, right? So that's the wormhole axilar model. Model number two, you got layer zero, which is basically just a two out of two multi sig.
00:03:38.846 - 00:04:19.562, Speaker A: But they put corporations there like Google Cloud, right? And everyone's saying, oh my God, so amazing. But actually, I think that's incredibly bearish. And then you have protocols like synapse, which is sort of like will mint to you a token, and then you swap it on the other side. So they basically print NUSD, they mint and burn NUSD, and they swap it for USDC or something on a stable swap pool. That's interesting, but I think that's like heavily liquidity constrained. So basically we discovered this protocol called IBC, which was existing in cosmos. And I was really excited about it because it is using liteclient verification on both sides.
00:04:19.562 - 00:04:47.986, Speaker A: It's like you just trust math and proofs. There's pretty much no one else controlling. You basically have to trust the chain, right? Like if the chain gets reorged, then IBC breaks. But I found this to be a really compelling bridging protocol. But then the issue was, oh, this is only in cosmos. And so that's obviously been the excuse that so many different bridging protocols have said. They've always said, oh, IBC is the best, but we just can't bring it to other ecosystems.
00:04:47.986 - 00:05:07.738, Speaker A: And so now we've spent the past, like two years doing this. We successfully brought IBC to Polkadot. We connected Polkadot and Cosmos. We also connected Polkadot and Kusama. Now we're doing Cosmos and know it's economies of. It's like we did the first few integrations, now the next ones are much, much simpler.
00:05:07.834 - 00:05:14.330, Speaker B: And what was it like learning that technology and building these bridges that others thought they couldn't do it really wasn't.
00:05:14.410 - 00:05:26.062, Speaker A: Probably still really isn't in vogue. The thing is, people just look at what we're doing as just another bridge. And the truth is, it's not just another bridge. On days when it's like a section.
00:05:26.126 - 00:05:27.234, Speaker B: Of what you're doing.
00:05:27.352 - 00:06:16.098, Speaker A: Well, yeah, that, but also right on days when bridging hacks do happen, everyone always says, oh wow, look at these IBC guys. They actually are trying to build solid technology, but it's a bit of an unsung struggle because the payoff is revenue on bridging volume and trying to get volume and stuff. When you're competing with such large players like layer zero who have hundreds of millions of volume per day and it's a two out of two multi sig, it really makes you think, do people actually give a shit about decentralization or do they just don't mind trusting Google cloud? When I think about crypto ten years down the line, I hope that we all appreciate decentralization, right? That's kind of the reason why we're all here. But at the same time, you see such massive usage of a two out.
00:06:16.104 - 00:06:58.270, Speaker B: Of two multi suit, I think that's just a contributor to no other solutions, no alternatives. So you're kind of just stuck with the centralization option, right? You can't really go decentralized if nobody's providing it well, I guess you're going to be that provider, so it's use until then, basically. You guys are also doing some pretty interesting stuff with the ETH, IBC, the ZK proofs research. I think that'll be pretty interesting. And even the ZK kind of realm as well. When you think about like Aztec or Scroll, they're going to be having their own ZK bridges and it's all going to be a web basically, but also massive attack vectors, if not done correctly because they're all unique, they don't have a standard, and it's just a massive target. So that's very exciting.
00:06:58.270 - 00:07:54.498, Speaker B: And once you land into the e realm, then you can finally compete with others, multichain, et cetera, hopefully take it over. Because just a multi sig of two people is just crazy to think about and nobody really cares because it's just ease of access. When they do research into it, it can be an easy choice. The decentralized option, you're doing more than just bridges, that's just a part in the entire pie or the equation. You're basically doing this interoperability chain agnostic swapping and transferring of assets and it's meant to be a true universal router. When you want to buy on chain Ethereum and send it over to cosmos or whatever chain you want, avax Phantom, you don't want to think about, oh, where am I going to bridge? How much? Okay, the fees, all this shit. To be able to scale crypto, there needs to be some ease of ux, but also connecting everything.
00:07:54.498 - 00:08:20.538, Speaker B: Everything is siloed basically to one chain. When a new chain spins up, it's literally just a clone of every other protocol from the previous chains. It's like a pretty bad model so far, but once these bridge problems are solved and all this stuff, it gets way better. And I think you're doing an interesting thing with this, with the fillers, if I'm correct, it's like all the searchers fill these orders that they put in kind of like uniswap x and Uni four.
00:08:20.704 - 00:08:49.838, Speaker A: So it's really insane that we have so many different east USDT pools. Let's just take USDT USDC, right? There's so many places to swap USDT USDC. Me, as the user, I'm just going to keep using my ecosystem that I know best. Why would I ever do anything on, like, I use eth mainnet. I've been using eth mainnet since day zero. I trust it. I do all my swaps on uniswap and current.
00:08:49.838 - 00:10:02.170, Speaker A: That is such a small way to look at the crypto ecosystem. But the reasoning for that is, how would anyone know any better if I get a better rate for my swap on, say, radium on Solano, where it's also faster and cheaper to do swaps in general. I'm just not going to take the time to figure that out and bridge and do the swap myself. All that stuff is just going to be something I don't think about. But I know always in the back of my head that the way that orders get filled in equities is someone puts out a trade, it goes into a dark pool and it gets executed on like ten different exchanges very quickly breaking up these orders and then reconciling them all at the same time in the same sort of location. And that's what we want to bring to crypto, because it is true that there is significant ARb opportunities between different chains. I think people still think, like, cross chain mev is a meme, but we're going to start putting out more and more research that shows actually there is quite a disparity between what just any, the deepest liquidity pools on every ecosystem of the same two assets.
00:10:02.250 - 00:10:45.526, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think also the reason cross chain arbitrage or any strategy isn't really people aren't really applying. It is because it goes from atomic to non atomic. And so you hold a lot of risk if the opportunity is no longer there while you're waiting for the bridge to execute, which could vary in time. It's never guaranteed. And so once there is something where it can be atomic, where you can be like, okay, I want to trade pool eth USD on Ethereum and let's say solana, and I want to do it in one trade where it's like this entire bridging route is within that transaction, which I imagine it would be like, not just like kind of pending forever. That just brings a whole new realm of opportunities.
00:10:45.526 - 00:11:01.120, Speaker B: And for the searcher as well, the people that are going to be filling in these orders, a lot of people would counter with the argument, why not just use swab from flashports when they release that? Because they're doing cross chain going on every single chain. What's your counter to that?
00:11:01.890 - 00:11:33.366, Speaker A: Yeah, for, so I think the realm of what we're doing sort of resembles suave. I guess it's a bit like a twice removed cousin of suave. We're sort of like similar principles. We're trying to build blocks for different ecosystems. But I think there's maybe three core differences that I see between us. And first, to use swab as a user, you need to bridge to swab first. That's like how anything begins.
00:11:33.366 - 00:12:24.166, Speaker A: As a user, I think that that is like a huge bottleneck that people are not really going to want to do. The second thing is, there is also a lack of commitments. So suave essentially is a play where they take MeV boost and they take this relay piece and they turn it into a chain. They build a block, and they send the full block to the proposer. The proposer can choose to not include the block at all. There's also this belief that, oh, yeah, as a know me beaver builds, I'm going to move to this world in which I'm no longer going to submit my trades, my blocks, to Meb boost. I'm going to submit my blocks to suave, and I'm basically going to compete to build the best block on suave with other builders and send them to proposers.
00:12:24.166 - 00:13:34.514, Speaker A: I don't really think that that's super realistic, considering how much money these guys are making right now with the current system. Of course, maybe flashbots just turns off Meb boost, but someone else would probably just spin up a very similar relay and people would just use it. So there's this concept of commitments, right? How do you get all these different actors to commit to doing what they say they're going to do? And it's a really hard problem because it's essentially unsolved, right? Because basically proposers want to do as little as physically possible and builders want to have a complete control of the entire process. My take is, okay, so no commitments. And then the third piece is we're much more diving into this belief that cross chain is going to be a thing much more than just like, hey, we build blocks for different domains, right? So this is where I have a huge belief in this concept called mempool matching. You want to do something on a chain, you submit your transaction to a mempool and suddenly you're matched with someone else in some other mempool. Like a cow, basically.
00:13:34.514 - 00:14:10.566, Speaker A: So how are we different? First we're developing a commitment scheme where basically proposers need to be committed in the system in order for them to receive order flow and participate in the system. What that looks like yet, I'm not sure. There's this recent work done by this guy, I forget his name. Diego. There's like Zero X, futuristic has done some work on PEPC. Someone also did some work on PEPC boost, which is like a new relay design where you enforce commitments off chain through a relay. I'm very interested in finding ways to make commitments.
00:14:10.566 - 00:14:48.370, Speaker A: So I'm looking at PEPC boost, I'm looking at restaking. There's like this idea from Eigen layer of MeV Boost Plus plus, where you have kind of validators that are natively restaked on Eigen layer. So that's like one area we're very deeply looking into to facilitate partial block auctions because we don't believe that we will build full blocks. We believe we'll be really, really good at building partial blocks, potentially strictly top of block transactions. Then the second piece of difference beyond commitments is you can submit a trade or you can do anything from anywhere. You don't have to bridge to our chain.
00:14:48.450 - 00:15:00.440, Speaker B: What would a partial block look like? You would build this partial block, right? So it could be like one quarter of one. But then what happens to that partial block? It's put onto a marketplace with a block builder to kind of, I guess you could say a bundle. Right? And then what happens?
00:15:01.090 - 00:15:41.354, Speaker A: Yes. So there's like two, three. So like early iterations, I would imagine these partial blocks just get sent to all builders and they basically choose to include them or not. Later iterations I'm toying with if we have something like PEPC Boost, where PEPC boost can allow for multiple different blocks to sort of be sorted into multiple different sections of a block to be sorted into a full block for proposings. So it's almost like an auction on another auction. Right now MeV Boost is just one auction for a full block. In PEPC boost it would basically be same thing.
00:15:41.354 - 00:16:01.566, Speaker A: But now you also got partial block builders who submit and also try to compete to win the auction for different sections of the block. That's kind of where I imagine things heading for us, but still very early, I think these are still lots of questions we're still trying to sort through.
00:16:01.748 - 00:16:21.990, Speaker B: The immediate thing I think about, when you think about cross chain is, is it all atomic? When someone says I want my intention to swap ethereum, to send my ethereum to basically Solana and do a swap on Solana, how does that process look like, is that atomic or kind of non atomic?
00:16:22.970 - 00:17:59.162, Speaker A: Well, so yeah, early on, without any of this commitment scheme or any of this sort of commitments layer, it would be non atomic. But to make things like let's just take the example of two roll ups, people believe that shared sequencing will bring cross chain atomicity. And it's true because you share the same sequencer, right. But we can take this a step further where basically if we have the mempools of multiple different roll ups and you express this intention somewhere, we can pull you into a mempool match and be able to facilitate cross chain atomicity. Assuming that the sequencers on the respective chains, like the people who are actually proposing these blocks on the respective roll ups and respective chains, in the case of validators, are committed to do so. If there is a commitment layer, anything is possible. But then the key question, right, is like why would anyone commit? And so the answer there is, well, more money, right? And so we have to define what does this more money actually mean? The more money is, in my mind, more mev being unlocked because of commitments, which is enough such that the money that they could make from these commitments is higher than the value of the work they have to do to be committed.
00:17:59.162 - 00:18:13.660, Speaker A: What that work, again looks like could be a variety of things, right? They could be restaked. There's a lot of different options there. We're trying to balance this supply chain so that is possible.
00:18:15.310 - 00:18:27.520, Speaker B: So when we say non atomic before the intent layer, really it would be basically someone filling this order on one side. Then what happens if it's not filled on the other side, then it's just left with.
00:18:30.450 - 00:19:28.030, Speaker A: Basically the lifecycle of a transaction in our system would basically be, you come in, you say, I want to do something, I want to swap my eth for Solana, and then bridge to Solana. And don't fill me, don't basically execute it unless both legs are able to get executed. So essentially how that would work is you come in, solvers basically come up with the best possible routes for you, and you have three ways of solving this. Number one, you either have cows, so someone else, you get mashed with someone else doing the same thing. Solver comes up with a route, or solver just executes it for you 100%. So in all of the cases, if both legs of this thing are not executed, then the whole transaction basically reverts and the searcher gets slashed. Sorry, the solver gets slashed.
00:19:28.030 - 00:20:14.960, Speaker A: Solver, searcher. I mean, the lines are getting very blurry. Yeah, the filler, exactly. But in the bull case, essentially your transaction would get sent to Ethereum, swapped on an amm. This would be, again, some sort of submitted to a builder or something to make sure that there's inclusion and then bridged to Solana. And that would sort of happen through something we call composable vm, which is like this orchestration layer that doesn't actually require the solver to do anything other than specify a route. Which is really interesting because I think Solvers are trending to becoming very centralized authorities that just fill things.
00:20:14.960 - 00:20:26.482, Speaker A: And I actually think it would be really cool if just like anyone could just run a solver and just compute routes. It makes it very much, a lot more permissionless, a lot more decentralized.
00:20:26.626 - 00:20:28.920, Speaker B: Yeah, like open source one, basically.
00:20:30.170 - 00:20:30.920, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:20:31.610 - 00:20:37.430, Speaker B: But then why would someone do that if the centralized ones are really making the money? Like kind of a monopoly.
00:20:38.570 - 00:21:22.280, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, the thing is, right, it's like, what if you're a solver that just always creates, you're able to find the most amount of cows or you're able to find the best routes, possibly, right. We don't know that a taker, sort of like a filler coming in and just filling you directly is always the best way. Right? Sure. You avoid doing things on chain, which means there's less risk involved from a sort of mev perspective. But if you're able to mitigate that mev, I don't know if that's necessarily always the best way. Right.
00:21:22.730 - 00:22:12.598, Speaker B: I think it could actually introduce a new type of mev since it is a cross chain interaction and you have these external fillers, aka searches, creating it for the person, it's basically pending mev. And so these searchers could do the simulation, right? But then they can also sandwich them entirely from both chains. And really it would happen anyway on any, I guess if you're doing a swap, let's say on Ethereum, you always sandwich, for example, if it was on uni. But if you're going from like Ethereum to Salana, me as a surgeon, I would see that you're about to perform this, I guess arbitrage if it's in the same pair. And so I would snipe it before you and so your one just wouldn't even fill and I would do it instead, 100%.
00:22:12.684 - 00:23:39.022, Speaker A: And this is exactly why commitments are super important, right? Because basically, just like you mentioned. So let's take the case, how do you not get wrecked, right? You don't get wrecked by essentially we build an east block and we build a sole block, and the searcher conditions what they want to do to extract mev in both blocks at the same time. And then the transaction on Solana is pending success of the transaction on Ethereum and the person who is proposing the block with the pending transaction, as you said, pending meV, would have to be committed to know propose this thing, propose that transaction until the east side was finalized. So that's one thing I've been thinking about as like a potential mitigation path. But yeah, I mean that's why in general we need a commitment layer, because otherwise you just get basically fucked. So what does this commitment layer look like? Basically trying to do cross domain PBS, but not PBS in the way we know it. Sort of pbs in the way of like proposer enforced, basically cross domain PEPC.
00:23:39.022 - 00:23:40.466, Speaker A: I guess maybe that's the better way.
00:23:40.488 - 00:23:42.530, Speaker B: To talk about it, I don't know.
00:23:42.600 - 00:24:14.640, Speaker A: But some sort of interdynamic between commitments and different chains and reconciling all these different off chain actors. So it's a big problem. It's actually one. I'm not sure that's solvable in the super near term. But if for instance, crosschain meb becomes bigger than sex Dex arbitrage as an example, then a solution like this is important and needed.
00:24:15.170 - 00:24:48.098, Speaker B: Yeah. When I think about cross chain, I would think about me being a builder and having, I guess somewhat of monopoly over something. So when you think about Ethereum builders, it's more beaver, Titan R sync. And those are basically the monopoly. And if I were to do cross chain, I would team up with the biggest builders on other chains and form some kind of cross communication. Yeah. Because then you benefit each other in that way.
00:24:48.098 - 00:25:04.000, Speaker B: And then you form up with a bridge, and then you just do that. You have some backdoor agreement, and you really just monopolize cross chain MeV in general, and you just do that for every chain and then you win.
00:25:04.770 - 00:25:22.882, Speaker A: Yeah. But if there's a protocol to facilitate payments for that so that maybe it's not completely backdoor, then I think that's interesting. I think that's actually where we're trying to play. Right. In a weird way.
00:25:23.016 - 00:25:46.250, Speaker B: Yeah. I think blockchains right now with the Builder systems is very weird because it does just become a monopoly, really. And it's not decentralized at all. The deep you go into it, the only thing decentralized is really the ledger, but that's all determined by a centralized entity.
00:25:47.070 - 00:26:16.150, Speaker A: Yeah. I think a lot of people imagine builders going away at some point. Right. The only reason why we have builders is because of PBS. Right. Like, Solana actually doesn't really have people sitting around building blocks for, like, Solana basically just streams. They have this client called the GTO client, and the lead proposer has the mempool.
00:26:16.150 - 00:26:45.280, Speaker A: And that lead proposer basically streams a 400 millisecond delay for searchers to go in and express themselves. And so what you sort of have in Salana is like searcher built blocks. And some people would say, oh, that's probably very bad. Are the builders really protecting us from searchers doing sandwiches and stuff?
00:26:45.810 - 00:27:17.614, Speaker B: Well, no, it doesn't make sense because, well, if you're a builder, your main goal is to get the max amount of money out of the block. So you compete with other people and win in the relay bids, basically. And so what's the most valuable? And also transaction order flow. Right. Order flow was the most important thing. And what gives you the most transactions is a sandwich. If you think about someone like Jared just spamming sandwiches versus just like a backrunner, an arbitrager.
00:27:17.614 - 00:27:51.380, Speaker B: Right? The arbitrager is always going to be one transaction less than the sandwicher. Sandwicher has basically three transactions, minimum in a sandwich. An arbitrager has two. So in terms of order flow, you have way more, I guess, transactions with sandwiches. Right. So it's a hard problem. If you're not going to accept it, someone else will and build a better block, unless they just have a way better algorithm and they just don't like sandwiches and somehow they still win.
00:27:52.630 - 00:29:19.854, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, so let's take the example of, like, let's take the example let's think of how basically, let's imagine a world in which builders are not needed on Ethereum anymore, right? Again, I don't know if that they will ever come, but let's assume we have some sort of enshrined PBS that reduces the power of builders. Maybe we already have searcher builder sort of integration, right? So maybe at some point the builder role goes away and everything sort of becomes, every block basically becomes searcher built, right, in Ethereum land. So if that's the case, then what you just mentioned before, which is like, say I'm a builder, I just go collaborate with another builder on another chain. You could search for multiple ecosystems, right? And then you could try to collaborate with searchers from other ecosystems to build, to coordinate the best blocks for every domain at the same time. And I think that's the direction I imagine the world going, where we make it so straightforward for searchers to express themselves that they're able to express what they want to do in these different ecosystems at the same time.
00:29:20.052 - 00:30:03.966, Speaker B: But then not everyone is going to be the same, just humans in general. When you think about countries and shit, they all do it their own way, despite, yeah, they all have their own vision and whatever they want to do, they would do it differently, even though if everyone was super aligned. Imagine if the entire world was like best friends of each other, it'd be a way better place. But obviously human nature is just like, well, no greed and whatnot. You have to move mountains to get it to happen as well. Everyone has to come to a consensus as well outside of blockchains to make that development. Yeah.
00:30:04.148 - 00:31:09.540, Speaker A: And I think in general it's okay as long as it's okay. From the perspective of searchers becoming specialized in some sort of vertical integration occurring across multiple different ecosystems, I don't think that that's necessarily bad. I just think that it's bad if the searchers are the only ones making money. Some of that goes back to the user. A big piece of that goes back to the user. Then we could unlock some cool things where what if your transaction is eth USDT on Ethereum and just as you're about to get executed, a searcher bribes you to go do the same transaction on Polygon? Do you really care if you're going to swap ETh USDTP on polygon versus mainnet? Maybe. But if you get paid enough, that's how we can unlock this pay for order flow like Robin Hood esque situation.
00:31:09.540 - 00:31:18.230, Speaker A: And I think ultimately that's what people want. But maybe don't really want to admit.
00:31:19.690 - 00:32:46.420, Speaker B: During the bull market on Ethereum, you're going to be paying ridiculous amounts of gas. Like for example, I paid like $50 for a transaction for a swap and I don't want to keep spamming different swaps. It would be great if someone else did that. Now I could give me the tokens as long as I have the tokens on Ethereum, you can do whatever you want with the transaction as long as I don't get sandwiched, basically. But then I guess you have to somehow have this routing thing of how do you know this token is on another chain and I can have it on my original chain? If you think about the game with a uniswap four, in original uniswaps, like Uniswap two, for example, there's a whole mev game of lp sniping, and the people creating these lp contracts have got toxic tokens in them to basically honeypot the searches and it becomes this whole sniping anti rug rug game. And so with Uniswap V four, it's going to be the same thing, but with exchanges, it's toxic exchanges, basically what they created. And so they created Uniswap X to basically just let the searches handle it because it is just like, I don't know, they kind of just created a problem really.
00:32:46.420 - 00:32:53.154, Speaker B: And it was like hand it over to the searchers and be like, you fix it, you deal with it.
00:32:53.192 - 00:32:58.326, Speaker A: I mean, end of the day, it's a searcher's world, man. You know what I mean?
00:32:58.508 - 00:33:08.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, decentralization, you need to incentivize people to execute stuff. And how do you do that with enabling them in this kind of world?
00:33:11.070 - 00:33:26.122, Speaker A: Philosophically, I think markets work better with. If I was to close my eyes right now and just imagine a world where searchers just didn't exist, I don't think that would be a net benefit for Ethereum.
00:33:26.186 - 00:33:38.530, Speaker B: It would just be like, I guess the chinese stock market. It's just a single entity controlling everything, determining what stocks you can buy and cannot.
00:33:41.670 - 00:34:55.142, Speaker A: This. There are so many different ways to skin this, but I think the ultimate end goal is just like how do you enable a Robin Hood experience for people in crypto? And if that means making searchers pay money for exchanging domains or cross chain meV, or building alliances between each other, or just enabling this marketplace of order flow settlement on different chains, as long as searchers are paying for that, maybe we get to a world where we do unlock this free trading experience. I think it will be years before we get there 100%, but I think we can at least have very marginal improvements in efficiency and massive improvements in decentralization though, right? Like MeV Boost is a problem. It's not cool that one. Centralized relay controls Ethereum.
00:34:55.286 - 00:35:46.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's just the reality right now, and especially with private mempools as well, that enabled sandwiching. Sandwiching never really existed before them. It was kind of, well, it could have, right, if you just paid high gas on Ethereum, but it just makes it basically fail proof, especially with hacks as well. Now you can just do a hack and do a private transaction, you guarantee the hack. It's not like you can run some detection system and find it and then outbid them, basically. So it's like a risky game to hack. But yeah, sandwiching, I think the negative parts of Mev I would consider exploits Mev as well.
00:35:46.460 - 00:36:18.550, Speaker B: They got really enabled. I think with flashbots, public mempools are just way better, I think. Especially when you have an exclusive order flow as well to specific builders, that's like a big thing. Of course you have the best searches, sending you their transactions over other builders, and then that's really another way of monopolizing. But man, if everything was public, then GG.
00:36:20.010 - 00:37:31.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a whole other lens to look at this stuff through, right, is also roll ups. We're so advanced in Ethland at this point with MeV and to some extent MEV mitigation, you have MEV share. Flashbox has done some good stuff to at least drive the conversation forward in ethereum land. But now you look at Celestia, right? And all these rollouts launching on Celestia, launching on Eigen layer. They're talking about shared sequencers. But none of these shared sequencers are opinionated about MeV. And a lot of these roll ups just want to basically outsource all of this thinking to just somebody, right? Because if you operate like a gaming roll up, you probably want to extract MEV for sure, because, you know, it's a different revenue stream, but you don't necessarily care how it's done.
00:37:31.740 - 00:37:57.794, Speaker A: And so I think that's also a lens with which to think about some of these concepts we're thinking about. It's just like, I think that a lot of this cross chain MeV stuff becomes a lot more interesting present workable into a product in these newer nascent ecosystems.
00:37:57.922 - 00:38:52.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, may I really hope this basically hub for cross chain gets into fruition, because I've seen a few protocols that do like cross chain vaults and strategies like that, or they just don't really take off as protocols that are just like native to one blockchain. Man, I hope this all does work out, to be honest. But I do want to shift the conversation more towards like a personal kind of topic of founding such a massive protocol and working with multiple chains and all this stuff. It's not an easy feat. Most people just build a single specialized thing, but this is multi domain and a lot of research has got to go into this to really hit everything and not miss out on a critical aspect. Right. So, man, what were like the early days of building this and.
00:38:53.770 - 00:38:54.198, Speaker A: What were.
00:38:54.204 - 00:38:57.160, Speaker B: The struggles you've gone through to get to the point where you are now?
00:38:58.750 - 00:39:47.720, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's a few lenses to look through this, right. The first is we're still early in that beyond the bridging components, there's still a lot of ways to skin this problem. Right? We have work that's going into different approaches. We'll end up having to come up with something and put that into production and see what happens. But research, building something truly novel really requires a lot of research, and there's not a lot of people who can actually do that research. And I sort of enjoyed that component of the work. But it's also difficult because the whole sort of strategy of the organization rests on the shoulders of what's coming next.
00:39:47.720 - 00:41:06.494, Speaker A: What are the new products that are going to drive more innovation and stuff like this? It's trying to strike a balance of putting stuff into production that people use, but also not designing a system that ends up being boring and that doesn't actually resemble what you actually care about, all while sort of trying to also make sure that the infrastructure, the bridging pieces are revenue generating and are used. So it's like we've definitely bitten off a lot more than we can chew. But that's also how you do interesting things in the space, is you build a really well thought out architecture that uses all these different components to come together for one product. That makes sense. The process has not been easy. There's been a lot of changes in strategies, changes in who you work with, changes even internally of who's part of the team. I think it's really just about having this north star of your values, which for me has always been best execution, decentralization and security, and trying to bring value to users, and then trying to also mess around with as many different ideas as possible and trying to get lots of feedback very quickly.
00:41:06.494 - 00:41:38.474, Speaker A: That's kind of one of the major benefits of flashbots, right, like suave, is not a perfect design. As I pointed out. They're going to put it into production. People will use it. But if people don't use it, they have so many different layers of forums, people they speak to regularly, they host conferences, et cetera. They're always in this feedback loop, and I really admire that about the flashbots team, and that's something we're trying to do as well. We have a research forum called Research Composable Finance, where I publish a bunch of the stuff that I'm thinking about.
00:41:38.474 - 00:42:54.478, Speaker A: But I think that's really critical, right? Because the only way, you know, you're building something useful is if you can get quick feedback on it. And in some of these types of topics, it's really hard to get that feedback because it's so new. So, yeah, it's about talking to interesting people, getting their thoughts, speaking to people in the industry, like builders, searchers, et cetera, getting their feedback and asking them, is this bullshit? Should I just tell me the truth, basically, should we focus on something else? What would you want to see? So, I think those are becoming customer minded as a crypto protocol, I think, is the biggest learning that I've had. And actually, the person who really pushes this forward in the ecosystem is Anatoli from Solana. He always says, if you can convince your first 100 customers to pay for what you want in crypto, that means a really big payoff, because those 100 people speak to another 100 people, and then basically, the 10,000 people that use CT and use these products all now pay for your product. And it's a very fast snowballing effect in crypto. So I'm excited for the future, but it really does matter, speaking to getting these quick feedback loops.
00:42:54.478 - 00:43:00.818, Speaker A: And I think I encourage more people to come to the forum, shit on my ideas, et cetera.
00:43:00.994 - 00:44:06.070, Speaker B: Something I've dealt with as well. When you build such complex and complicated, in some ways, depending on what it is, projects with so many moving parts, and there's no definitive answer of the best way this problem being solved, it's a lot of trade offs. How do you deal with so many, I guess, options, and being able to not get burnt out from that many options? Because me personally, with building a fuzzer, for example, there's so many ways, and you can build it in different kind of aspects. And when you're thinking about the algorithms behind it, it's really not easy when you have an infinite search space and you're trying to filter it down. But then you have different trade offs for how that's going to affect it. It's just like you really got a trial and error, but sometimes it's overwhelming, especially as your team grows and you've got, yeah, I think you're managing a lot of people now from when you first started. It's getting quite big, and obviously you can onboard and whatnot, but businesses is one of the most stressful things you can do, if not the most, because there's so many things involved, a lot of overhead, and if you just lack in any one area, it can kind of all go to shit.
00:44:06.070 - 00:44:16.510, Speaker B: How do you really stay on top of things and not get burnt out, really? Or maybe you do get burnt out and that's a normal human thing that happens. But is there any tactics, strategies?
00:44:16.850 - 00:45:07.870, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So I think my most unproductive, when I stew on something for a really long time, where I'm like, oh, I need to think of the perfect design. What are people going to think of? What are people going to think of these ideas if they're like half baked or whatever? So I sort of get in my head thinking about all these different options and ideas, and I just end up accomplishing basically nothing. And I think that the key learning there is just like, develop a group of people around you that can give you quick feedback. And this is what I sort of have in my relationship with lass, our CTO. He sort of brings me back down from cloudiness and helps me sort of think through these different options and architectures. And, you know, we have a research team within composable as well.
00:45:07.870 - 00:45:49.206, Speaker A: So I do this on a daily basis with those guys, too. But, yeah, I think that's one key piece. And the second key piece is just don't get nerd sniped by everything. It's really hard to not get nerd sniped by everything. I've been nerd sniped by so many different things in the past six months, and it's important to stay up to date. But one of the skills that people in similar positions, similar to me, is like, founders of a business, you need to also filter stuff. I shouldn't be sitting reading about the latest starks research when nothing that we're doing has anything to do with starks.
00:45:49.206 - 00:45:50.634, Speaker A: Should I be aware of it?
00:45:50.672 - 00:45:51.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:51.168 - 00:46:06.606, Speaker A: Should I maybe block out a couple hours a week to just do free form research? Reading, definitely, but not every day. I think that crypto, Twitter tends to become a very addictive place that also contributes to burnout.
00:46:06.798 - 00:46:41.840, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think being able to set up your time and prioritizing what needs to be done because I think it also comes down to stresses as well. Me personally, I'm just anxious person and I have a lot of stress in general. And so one of my strategies is just like remove as much as you can and accept the things you cannot change, but then build the day that you would be happy with. That could be procrastination as well, but active procrastination, not being guilty about procrastinating and then having this super negative feedback loop that just eats away at your drive and passion. You just feel really bad about yourself.
00:46:42.370 - 00:47:33.258, Speaker A: It's so easy to fall into that, man. You have to make a real conscious effort to. Not especially when you are someone that is trying to be ambitious because you want to do everything and there's only so many hours in the day. Other things that I've noticed too is like calls, man. Some people calls are really useful, but generally speaking, 95% of things can probably be an email or a message. If you get really strict about your call schedules with even people within your team and stuff, and you have calls only between specific windows, like for x amount of specific hours per day, this helps a lot because maybe you just need some time to just work and think through things. For me, I've definitely fallen a lot into these call fill days.
00:47:33.258 - 00:47:57.778, Speaker A: Then things just like compound for weeks and then I'm like, oh, I didn't actually accomplish anything that I wanted to do. I was sort of ticking boxes. Whether it's like building new bd relationships. I mean, again, this is part of my job as the sort of founder, but these things can be built. You can build this in such a way, your schedule in such a way where just like you said, you built the day you want to live.
00:47:57.864 - 00:48:25.662, Speaker B: It doesn't have to be completely strict of going every 30 minutes or every 10 minutes of the day. I personally gone every 30 minutes in the past and it works. But you've got to be realistic about, you're a human, you're not a robot. You can't just work 12 hours straight every single day for years on end and not feel burnt out. It's inevitable that one day you've done too much and your body's going to force you to take a break. And that might be for months on end. Me personally, that's what happened.
00:48:25.662 - 00:48:52.134, Speaker B: I just worked every day for every hour. Even though I loved it, I enjoyed working. It's eventually all caught up and then it sort of like a month and a half off straight of just like nothingness. I just couldn't even get myself to sit on the computer. I would just get instantly tired. Even though it was something I really enjoyed and it was really weird because it's something I was doing every day. But there needs to be balance in some way, in some degree of a healthy acceptance of I am a human.
00:48:52.134 - 00:49:10.566, Speaker B: This is a necessity to socialize because humans are social creatures. It's not just Internet and goblin mode. You need to actually talk to people IRL and make friends. It's a pretty critical aspect. But man, yeah, there's so many key factors that we kind of overlook.
00:49:10.678 - 00:49:12.378, Speaker A: 100%. Totally agree.
00:49:12.464 - 00:49:55.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a lot of things there and I think the main contributor to any success is just consistency, really. And it comes down to how can you be consistent? You don't have to work 12 hours, you could really just work 4 hours. Hyper focused. You can get a lot done in that time versus the guy that's working 12 hours, but jumping from one thing to another, like phone scrolling, then work for 30 minutes, go back. It's not as efficient, even though it may be longer. The quality is not as good as the quantity. So yeah, I'm really hoping to see the future composable and hopefully it all revolutionizes crypto for the better because we need something to scale this ecosystem so it's not siloed shitcoins everywhere and copy pastas of protocols from Ethereum and whatnot.
00:49:55.670 - 00:50:00.326, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm really hoping that the future is bright for you and composable.
00:50:00.438 - 00:50:24.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I appreciate it, man. We're definitely still on the path to solving a bunch of different things, especially as we enter, as we sort of begin to make the move from just great bridging to other things. On top of this bridging infrastructure, there's definitely going to be a bit of a learning and storming phase. Yeah, I'm excited to go through it and I think six months from now will definitely look a lot different.
00:50:24.392 - 00:50:54.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, any new technology enables new possibilities, right? So you never know what's going to happen until it's there. So wait until the day and then it will change everything, hopefully. But either way, man, it was terrific meeting you in Dubai and it's lovely having you on and being able to share this experience and the force behind composable the masterminds behind it all. And hopefully it gives some inspiration to someone to go forth and build something, just anything. So. So thank you so much for spending, spending your time with me and talking about this today.
00:50:55.060 - 00:50:58.030, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%, man. Thanks for having me. Really appreciate you.
00:50:58.100 - 00:51:03.534, Speaker B: Likewise. And for anyone listening. Thanks for listening. Take care.
00:51:03.732 - 00:51:05.340, Speaker A: Take care. See you.
