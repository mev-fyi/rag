00:00:00.490 - 00:00:27.426, Speaker A: Information wasn't just given to the model sequentially, but also spatially. Or in other words, it didn't just learn from data flow like static analyzers, which are sequential but also control flow. Right, which is essential for executing different functions in different contracts and the whole 3d space between the model. Right, between all. Among all the functional calls GM.
00:00:27.458 - 00:00:35.638, Speaker B: GM. Everyone, my name is Digash, your host from scraping bits. And today I've got a special guest, Lucas Martin Cauldron. How's it going, friend?
00:00:35.724 - 00:00:38.102, Speaker A: Nice. A pleasure, GM. Thank you for having me here.
00:00:38.156 - 00:00:49.462, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. And we've never actually spoken before. I just kind of found you on Twitter. You look like you're doing some quite interesting things and wanted to get you on and have a chat. I think what a good intro it should be. Who are you and what do you.
00:00:49.516 - 00:01:15.746, Speaker A: Oh, that's. That's really a very good question. So I am the founder and CEO of Pentestify. We are actually a young startup that is actually in the intersection between the whole hype of artificial intelligence, smart contract security vulnerability and the blockchain space. We are hitting quite a few points now and yeah, can't wait for the future.
00:01:15.848 - 00:01:30.154, Speaker B: The future is a certainly exciting thing, especially in the realm of cybersecurity and what you're doing as well. AI and I would like to touch on your two products. You have one that's in web two security and web3 security. So how about you tell us a bit about those?
00:01:30.272 - 00:01:49.962, Speaker A: Absolutely. So fantastic. We've named everything, by the way, after the Matrix, the Matrix movie. So it's one of my favorite. So, yeah, don't be afraid if I use too much of that nomenclature. It's a favorite trilogy, at least the first three films. And we've got Neo and Morpheus.
00:01:49.962 - 00:02:09.560, Speaker A: And then we've got something for the future called Academy, a bootcamp. But focusing on Neo. Neo is our flagship product. It detects the vulnerabilities in smart contracts using AI. We'll get more into that later, I'm sure. And then we've got Morpheus. Morpheus is actually the product from my previous company.
00:02:09.560 - 00:02:45.150, Speaker A: I am a second time entrepreneur. And as I exited my first company, whose product was based on the research on academic research from my previous university, I took that product and transferred that to pen testify. That was not easy, legally speaking, as you can expect. But it was successful. And I actually started as a pen tester, as an ethical hacker in the web two it traditional security. So we automated the entire process using AI in ethical hacking. And then we are actually doing the same in web3.
00:02:45.220 - 00:02:57.140, Speaker B: First of all, congratulations to the exit. I am quite interested in how you actually got into web two, cybersecurity, because that's something I've always wanted to do, but I kind of just skipped that and went straight to web3. Yeah.
00:02:58.890 - 00:03:26.542, Speaker A: For sure. I'm quite happy that I went that route. Well, how much time you've got? It's actually a long story, but everything's. I'll give you the minutes, the last minutes, the brief minutes. I actually started it when I was at school. I was quite fortunate to start programming with scratch. I'm not sure if you've heard that program, maybe it's not even programming, but it's supposed to teach you that.
00:03:26.542 - 00:04:18.286, Speaker A: And I loved it. I loved being able to be a creator with a computer, and I just thought of the scalability of that. At that time, I was 1213 years old, so I couldn't stop asking myself, how does that work? Why does that work? How would that work if I did that? So obviously that led me to all those questions, led me to tinkering with stuff, both electronics and software, and cybersecurity was just putting a word to the concept of what I was already doing. So in terms of mindset, I adopted it. Since I've always had an engineering mind, right, I always ask myself how stuff works. And as soon as I got started programming, I got started deep into the windows and macOS operating systems and the journey that. The rest is history.
00:04:18.286 - 00:04:32.354, Speaker A: So I ranked top as well, top percent in the world in hack the box. Try hack me shortly after. So, yeah, I dug deep into it and I didn't exit since then.
00:04:32.472 - 00:04:52.250, Speaker B: I would love to talk about the come up of that initial startup, how you kind of formed it from the ground up and got to the point where you've had a successful exit. Because I don't think a lot of people even get to that point, right? They just make a startup, see how it goes, and then sometimes it fails. But some people, like yourself, get a successful exit out of it and then start something new. I would like to venture into that journey.
00:04:52.670 - 00:05:24.082, Speaker A: No, for sure. I've had many failures in the past as well, so failing is something I'm extremely accustomed to. For the worst or for the better. Definitely wasn't. It wasn't a big exit, but it was a successfully exiting the business, which was honestly what a co founder hopes for as well, given how many bad things could happen. Right? And I got started because as I said, the question how does that work? Led me to cyber. But Cyber wasn't good enough.
00:05:24.082 - 00:06:26.690, Speaker A: I was hungry, actually, for more, and I said, how can I make an impact in the world? I wasn't 100% passionate about AI as I was about Cyber, but I knew that whether I liked it or not, it would be very difficult to have a successful business in the future where AI wasn't present. Something like, if I wanted to become a writer and I didn't know how to write, right, AI, is that knowing how to write, then the whole story is cybersecurity. So I've seen that since 15 years old and since then, as a hobby. And then it became more official, I dug into AI. So my first company was an alignment between them two, automating the ethical hacking process using several models such as DRL, so deep reinforcement learning, and many others. So yeah, it was pretty much an intersection doomed to happen in the right way between these two technologies.
00:06:26.770 - 00:06:57.258, Speaker B: AI is quite a powerful tool, and I think in the coming years it's going to be very much more significant than it is right now with Chad GPT four, I know that really took off, and it's kind of on everyone's mind, but in the future, it's definitely going to be a significant factor in every business, no matter what it is, and do some really interesting things with it. Right. Something very interesting is using it for fuzzing. That's something I'm looking into exploring, and I wonder if you're taking that route in any way with your tools.
00:06:57.354 - 00:07:30.790, Speaker A: No, for sure. Fuzing is definitely one of the strong suits of AI. It is not the one that we follow at Pentacify. In fact, our route is mostly what are the current state of the art tools in the static field, as well as the dynamic. So tools like Slither, Mantico, trolls of bits are doing an amazing job. I was talking to them actually yesterday, and they were saying they've got extremely interesting things in store. So we didn't want to follow with AI.
00:07:30.790 - 00:08:24.574, Speaker A: They don't want to disclose any more information, but they're definitely looking deep into it and developing a tool with it. So I can't wait to see that. But coming back to your question, right, about why we do not use AI for fuzzing, it was mostly because, not because it is not an amazing area to explore and very lucrative, I'm sure, in the future, but mostly because we wanted to make sure that the tools that are ready in the market are pretty good at what they do already. Slither as a static analyzer or secureify or all these other tools do a pretty good job. So do Manticore, other fuzzers as well. And we wanted to explore a whole new area where the data wasn't done sequentially, so there wasn't that very clear data flow, but instead there was a control flow as well. So we decided to focus on that.
00:08:24.574 - 00:08:35.242, Speaker A: But given especially the creativity that we've been able to see from in the recent months, in the past few months, fuzzing is just one of the best candidates, actually, as well, for AI.
00:08:35.306 - 00:09:03.754, Speaker B: And if you've read any of trailhitter's papers, they've done some studies on fuzzing and invariant testing. And in web free, that takes a large portion of successful findings. Right. I think it's like 60% plus or even higher, which is quite interesting. But I think automating the invariance is the hardest thing, though, because you don't know basically the business logic prior to the fuzzes. Right. So I think that's the hardest thing.
00:09:03.754 - 00:09:15.450, Speaker B: But it would be interesting to see someone try do that. But I think that's probably one of the most complex problems you can get in cybersecurity.
00:09:16.450 - 00:10:00.698, Speaker A: Yeah, well, actually, AI is coming to these white collar, most intellectual jobs, so I would probably expect the whole business logic, as you mentioned, rather than being a limiting factor. Been another reason why maybe adding transformer networks would be able to solve that problem. Because that requires a comprehension of what's written, a comprehension of the business itself. And generally speaking, nlps, such as those that use transformers like GPT four, and all this that we've been hearing about, maybe they could help. And I wouldn't be surprised if the business logic was mostly taken care of by an NLP in the coming future.
00:10:00.784 - 00:10:28.642, Speaker B: For it to even comprehend what it's meaning to do would be difficult, because maybe there was something implemented that wasn't meant to be implemented in that way, but it's not documented anywhere, and then it would just have to assume that it's right. So I think exactly. That's kind of the hardest thing for anybody to detect. But I would like to go on to your web free tool, because I think that might be a bit interesting. What does that look like?
00:10:28.696 - 00:11:20.114, Speaker A: Yeah, as I said, the main point was what tools exist nowadays, and how can we make the field better. And I mean, there is a very different thing. The mission of the company and the vision of the company. Our vision is to have at least 60% of all transactions within DeFi, go through our smart contracts, and detect directly from the bytecode whether something specially and sequentially looks like a vulnerability or like an attack. That is how we're very optimistic vision that we think we can achieve. However, the mission of the company is quite different and it's actually quite personal. The web free space, for sure, whether people want it or not, is the next evolution of the Internet.
00:11:20.114 - 00:12:22.954, Speaker A: I think at least we can agree on that. For the non believers in the blockchain right out there, however, blockchain, many people think that it gives complete anonymity and it is a tool to be private and to execute that right of digital privacy. I come from a web two cybersecurity background, right? So it is difficult for me to say that we had that right always in privacy. Regarding cybersecurity, of course, we know how spionage works and things like that. So definitely it wasn't 100% safe, but it could have been much worse. We live in a world at least where privacy is a human right, digital privacy as well. So I'm actually seeing how the world is evolving, especially with CBDCs and how Davos and the WEF and BIs and all these banks want the future to look like.
00:12:22.954 - 00:13:06.470, Speaker A: And that future actually makes me afraid and makes me have a big concern about the future of digital privacy. Exactly. So the good thing about this is pen testify us as a company and community as well, most importantly our community. We don't have to conquer the market to convince people of what can be done with the blockchain. How human rights in terms of privacy could be protected with the blockchain, legally speaking, of course. And I do believe that even if we are just 10% of that spark, that 10% is going to put the 90% remaining on fire. Right.
00:13:06.470 - 00:13:51.798, Speaker A: There won't be a possibility of a government or a big enough institution to say that's how it is. That's the privacy that comes with the blockchain. Because as soon as one person out of seven, 8 billion that we are today, as long as one person says, hey, this other company is actually protecting our privacy that way, in terms of security, in terms of everything, then it would be much more difficult for these big corporations to establish that truth, which is not really that truth. Right? So that's our mission, to make sure that the world can see that the blockchain is a double edged sword and could be used to protect still our right to privacy. So that's the real thing behind.
00:13:51.884 - 00:14:01.530, Speaker B: I totally agree with these big corporations or governments hiding the truth and making it all up. It's totally possible, right. If someone controls everything, they can do really whatever they want.
00:14:01.600 - 00:14:02.122, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:14:02.256 - 00:14:24.190, Speaker B: Cybersecurity is extremely important in this day and age because our whole lives revolve around the Internet. I'm more scared of someone breaking, not breaking into my home, but breaking into my email and all my digital accounts. Because if you lose that, you kind of lost everything, really. Unless you just have all your money, et cetera, in physical form, someone can just go on to digital.
00:14:24.270 - 00:14:24.850, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:14:25.000 - 00:14:27.890, Speaker B: Kind of steal your identity and become.
00:14:27.960 - 00:14:30.286, Speaker A: You hashtag ledger anyways.
00:14:30.478 - 00:14:53.660, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I 100% agree with that and it's a very important thing. But I do want to get more technical now and get into kind of the weeds of your tool. And have you built it from the ground up? I know it's a very difficult journey and I like to see, understand the process you took to get it to where it is now.
00:14:54.510 - 00:15:33.494, Speaker A: Yeah. And of course it continues to be a challenge, especially because we are at several frontiers that wherever we want to look at, that could be considered a phd in itself. Right. The journey is definitely not easy, not because there is a lot of work to do, but because there is a lot of work that hasn't been done before. So for sure, we are definitely pioneers in that field. But how we started it from scratch, starting with the concept, it came right at the end of my previous company where I said, blockchain is still growing. I was already five years prior, I was already within the blockchain, weeds and things like that.
00:15:33.494 - 00:16:24.726, Speaker A: So I've always been a big fan, as I said, since very early on, of blockchain. And I said, what if we're able to automate the exact same thing in web two, but in web3? So that's how it came to fruition. And then we said, with the current tools that we consider in the following categories, right, formal verification, which is very mathematical based, intense, static analyzers as well as dynamic, if we count symbolic execution and intermediate representation as static as well. So with all of them, it's not that they needed to be replaced. They had very good strengths and most of them were open source. So I said, definitely that wouldn't be a competitive field. What about creating a new category? And then, of course, you question about all the difficulties in the market that there is, whether there is truly a need for that, and so on.
00:16:24.726 - 00:17:12.626, Speaker A: And I said, where do most attacks? Well, actually all of them happen post deployment. How many companies or tools are actually analyzing things post deployment? Actually, not many. In fact, I had very a big difficulty finding a single one. And I do not mean tools. Amazing tools from open zeppelin, such as defender or tenderly. Those are mostly monitoring tools, right? I mean, deeply security analyzers. And I said, if post deployment, these tools, these smart contracts, right, most likely they've gone through static, dynamic, formal, only God knows why, what else? So we can definitely compete in the same arena, and therefore a new category that would surpass the accuracy of these tools.
00:17:12.626 - 00:18:23.066, Speaker A: Otherwise it would be for nothing would need to be created. And that actually came to deep learning. I cannot get much into detail about exactly which models we use, but I could definitely tell you that the deep reinforcement learning models that we use have a particularity which is being able to. So you know that you normally have a master node where it actually gathers all the learning experiences of the agents. And the agents are these lines of code devoted to trying things out, at first randomly, and then through a feedback loop, a reward system, improving their accuracy and their intuition in quotes. So by mixing these agents with other types of state of the art AI that we developed in house, we realized that. Now, this policy from the deep reinforcement learning algorithm model could sense smart contracts or the bytecode through different ways of thinking, such as information wasn't just given to the model sequentially, but also spatially.
00:18:23.066 - 00:19:17.774, Speaker A: Or in other words, it didn't just learn from data flow, like static analyzers, which are sequential, but also control flow. Right, which is essential for executing different functions in different contracts and the whole 3d space between them, all right, among all the function calls. So that in itself was a whole different category that was able to detect variations of very simple vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy. And we said, we've hit maybe potentially something big. So I went to UCL University College London. They were absolutely very keen on developing that idea. Working on that, it got me my masters, it got me the PhD, which, just for clarification, I haven't started, but they were definitely.
00:19:17.774 - 00:19:37.526, Speaker A: Yeah, that's another whole different conversation, by the way. But definitely, they were like, lucas, this is the future. It would be very good to see how this evolves, because it could be a game changer. So that's actually how the whole concept and ideology of pen testify of neo this product came along.
00:19:37.628 - 00:20:35.542, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I am doing somewhat of the same thing, but I've never dabbled in AI, so my knowledge is limited to what's possible. Right. But I've kind of taken the heuristic approach. Basically, I've gathered a really solid understanding of how bytecode works and how common patterns happen and auditing, and basically how critical vulnerabilities occur. And these kind of unique vulnerabilities occur because in web two and web3, it's quite different to find something that's extremely detrimental. In web3, it can be either two things, separate transactions that kind of build up to something, or multiple contracts interacting to basically formulate a context where the original contract is basically open for exploitation, or it can be a combination of both.
00:20:35.542 - 00:20:45.740, Speaker B: Right. In web two, there's no concept of sequence of transactions and that kind of stuff.
00:20:46.110 - 00:20:46.570, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:20:46.640 - 00:21:18.386, Speaker B: It is a whole new world, and that's why nothing has been developed. And I don't know if we're the only two people building this kind of stuff. So I think I found my competitor. But it's quite interesting using AI and deep learning basically to find this. I think there was a paper from, I forget his name, but it's either Wu or Wen. And they did a paper on AI for fuzzing, I think. But it is quite interesting.
00:21:18.386 - 00:21:43.680, Speaker B: I don't know what they actually specifically do, but yeah, it definitely is the future. If you can get something running, which it seems like you have, then you're going to capture the whole market. Right. But first of all, how did you even get into all this AI stuff as well? And if you were to take the path again to learning AI relevant to cybersecurity, what would you do to kind of get to this point where you're at now in the fastest way possible?
00:21:44.770 - 00:22:29.386, Speaker A: Now that's a very good question that I'm actually very happy answering, especially for the people listening and especially given how the web3 space is the journey, that there are many things to say. One of them is be careful when passion is your main driver. Since 1314 years old that I started to code these. Why? How? What if was definitely my passion, I couldn't resist. But to ask those questions. A lot of people misinterpret passion for what their hype is. And the problem with that is, unless you haven't properly detected that that feeling is a true passion that is not going to get away, given that it's emotionally based.
00:22:29.386 - 00:23:27.946, Speaker A: Most likely they will get into the depths of it all, onto web3, for example. And then six months later, one year later, they will realize that now they've fallen in love with another hype. Right? So I am a super reflective person. I live many hours of the day in the thinking plane, right? And I felt that I was sure that this technology and cybersecurity were kind of my passion and were going to be until the last day. Right? So if you can feel it, then it's easy. If not, you should really question whether it is a hype based on emotions and we are highly emotional beings, right? Or whether it's something that is going to keep every single day of your life and even it's getting stronger by the day. But the second point as well, equally as important, is I didn't start studying AI out of passion.
00:23:27.946 - 00:24:55.066, Speaker A: It was mostly because I wanted to be successful in cyber and I didn't see a way of being successful with my own business. And again, I was about 15 years old, so extremely young, and I didn't see a way doing this without AI because of the amount of data that the world has. I just didn't see a way. I just felt that if I didn't take AI into consideration to help me, if I didn't harness the power of AI, I will become what we say, the cog in the machine, right? So then year after year, I realized that I was getting a bit of a competitive edge, having this double focus, right? So the passion actually started coming from the kind of the level and the knowledge that I had from AI. But originally it was mostly because I didn't see a way to succeed where I really wanted to succeed in cybersecurity. So all of this kind of the main advice that I give, which is very difficult, because again, it is emotional, is in web3, we don't stop hearing about the hypes or with pepecoin, all these small waves that people serve, and many of them are extremely lucrative, right? And again, this is my personal opinion, but an opinion that I've seen in myself and especially in other people, way more successful than I am, that has absolutely worked. But unfortunately, it's not the easy way.
00:24:55.066 - 00:26:03.086, Speaker A: It is being able from the foundation, learn how things work, be consistent, and if you have two options to create that new small trend where you're actually standing on the shoulders of giants, instead of understanding what the giant is, then it's okay. But you should know that that is only temporary. What is going to give you purpose in life, what is going to give you true happiness is not riding small waves. It is rather riding the biggest wave of your life that you truly believe in. And therefore, my recommendation is do not jump on new things that you don't believe that in five years you won't be better at because you would have already left them and things like that. By this, I'm not saying don't take any risks, because that risk could lead to something longer than five years or maybe less than one year, but for sure have some principles, some pillars that you're based on in my case, it was cyber AI and blockchain. And if that is aligned with your principles, then most of your decisions are already made, and those will be very simple and most importantly, the biggest and most important ones in your life.
00:26:03.086 - 00:26:12.274, Speaker A: So not jump into the new shiny thing, but rather being sure that what you're in is what the world needs, what you love, and what you're good at.
00:26:12.312 - 00:26:56.162, Speaker B: Yeah, I 100% agree. If you don't have passion in something, and you've got to test this, whether you're constantly thinking about it basically all the time, I think it's what I experience, but I think you definitely need passion. Otherwise, there's no longevity in, basically, the task you're trying to complete. And you've also got to try and complete something that's going to be worthwhile, like try and solve a massive problem. I think these small ones are great, but if you really want to bring innovation, then if you really want to innovate and change the world, the space, I think it's the difficult things that are going to do that, not these quick little scripts of one week. I mean, they're possible. Yeah, you can 100% do that.
00:26:56.162 - 00:27:15.606, Speaker B: But the really difficult problems are what's going to revolutionize the space, and I think this is definitely one of them. Having said that, now that we know how to basically find something to pursue, in this case, let's say, AI, how do we get into AI and learn about deep enforcement learning and all that kind of stuff?
00:27:15.708 - 00:27:47.262, Speaker A: For sure. So, again, I love always going to the base of it all. When I started learning about AI, well, first of all, you have to know the reason why that's the case. In my case, it was. Cybersecurity is not only about data, it's also about behavior. What are humans good at? What are machines better at? And AI was complementary to what humans were. And out of all the technologies out there, I didn't choose, let's say, augmented reality.
00:27:47.262 - 00:28:36.814, Speaker A: I didn't choose VR, which was a big thing back then as well. And even though we are hearing about it again with Apple's new headset and so on, but it's been for a while in our lives, right? So if you truly have a valid reason and you don't have to be a genius at it, you just have to have a good common sense that that technology makes sense, then that is the first step. The second one is, I started reading a book by MIT about the fundamentals of, mathematically speaking, so, pretty much statistics, probability. Yeah, the core mathematical concepts. It's like, if you want to study ZK, right. You have to start with cryptography, and that is a lot of maths that normally people avoid. But it is the basic of it all, then that is quite theoretical.
00:28:36.814 - 00:29:05.114, Speaker A: There is little practice, honestly speaking. But right after that, I know that one of my learning styles is following, let's say, online videos, tutorials, and coding at the same time. I don't know why, but that truly just clicks in my brain with whatever it is. So doing that. But most importantly, coding, it's on the right. They said that if you read something, you're about to retain it. I think it was about ten or 20%.
00:29:05.114 - 00:29:35.490, Speaker A: But if you hear, read and practice, it's 90% likely to remember what you and understand what you learned. Right. So at least scientifically, I'm happy. That makes sense, those tutorials. And again, I'm never afraid. We're starting with the basis from zero. Even if I have to go back 20 years or things like that, I wouldn't be afraid.
00:29:35.490 - 00:30:07.354, Speaker A: And then you grow to the advanced level, honestly, doing your own project, the main reason why you got into this field in the first place, I would say, for me, I'm a bit more theoretical than practical. A lot of people say, let's say 80% hands on and then 20% practice. I would be more like at the beginning, 60% theory and 40% practice. And then maybe 60% practice, 40% theory. So, yeah, it's quite balanced.
00:30:07.482 - 00:30:12.666, Speaker B: Got you. I'm quite the opposite, actually. I go into practice.
00:30:12.778 - 00:30:14.500, Speaker A: I know I'm quite unique in this.
00:30:15.350 - 00:30:58.222, Speaker B: Yeah. For me, I can read a lot, but not really retain it. But if I don't have a reason, like an underlying reason. So my kind of methodology for building massive projects is basically, all right, what do we need to get to the next level? And, okay, what are the problems we need to solve? Okay, let's solve this problem. What is required for this problem to be solved? And then go into the topics or basically things that can help solve that first little small task to get to the next level and then continuously go up there. And if they hit a path that requires more information or something I haven't built or go back and build it, then try and fix that problem. Right.
00:30:58.222 - 00:31:38.074, Speaker B: So I think in my personal experience, it's been incredibly effective, and I've kind of accelerated my time in the coding space. I've only coded for two years, but I've gotten to a point where I feel I'm in a very small niche, and I'm kind of getting to a point where I'm pioneering some stuff just like you, maybe in a different way, though, without the use of AI, but deep enforcement learning. I'm quite interested in AI. It's just very hard to start. I think I was under the impression you needed basically servers and a lot of computational power to hold all those results. And I didn't know how to start any of that. But to be fair, I never tried.
00:31:38.074 - 00:31:42.480, Speaker B: So I guess a big point to touch on as well.
00:31:43.330 - 00:32:27.386, Speaker A: Yeah, no, for sure. It's a valid point, what you mentioned, and regarding the first point that you said, probably it is only that I'm thick headed and I prefer to be a bit more theoretical, but I don't know if that happens to someone else, maybe one of your listeners, that I'd rather know how big or the total size of the field before I start practicing. Right. I know that when I'm practicing without learning the theory, I get those learnings 100%. I understand what I'm doing and I learn a lot. But however, I have the feeling that I go in blind. But if I know how big the field is, I don't have to be, of course, an expert at it.
00:32:27.386 - 00:33:13.020, Speaker A: I could even be a beginner, but with a very clear theoretical understanding of what the field is, how big it is, and kind of the borders, the limits of the current state of the research. Right. Then applying, I see a better direction, which is always very important. But again, it might come down to me being thick headed and trying to get this theory. Maybe it would have worked better and I would have been able to accelerate a little bit more my learning, but I definitely prefer that methodology. But yeah, most of the successful people that I know as well use a bit more similar to you in terms of learning, a bit more practical than theoretical. But yeah, either of them, I think, is as long as it works for you, then that's the case.
00:33:13.020 - 00:33:54.370, Speaker A: You've already made your case, so that's good. And regarding your second point about AI, it is true that you do need to train the AI models, and there are two ways to training, of course, to train it, either through unsupervised learning or supervised learning, or something in between. Mixed. But given an unsupervised model, which seems to be the most popular one today, and what I believe the future is, even though that is a generalization, because it depends on the application, of course, but you can already use pre trained models. In fact, there is a huge library that I recommend you kind of research. It's called hagging phase. I think it's based in France.
00:33:54.370 - 00:34:14.174, Speaker A: But they do an amazing job. Yeah. Hagging face, it has nothing to do with AI, the name, I know, but hugging face. And they have, I think they're the world's largest or one of them with LLM models, which is like chat TPT, GPT four. Right. And you can already find pre trained models. Right.
00:34:14.174 - 00:35:07.486, Speaker A: And in terms of compute power, if the model is already trained on inference, right, you don't need a lot of your laptop can by far do an amazing job. I was sharing the other day, the CEO of stability AI, which is something like Midjani, and he said by the end of next year, we would already have the entirety of chat TBT in our phones offline. So imagine having that huge power, all the terabytes and petabytes of information in a few gigabytes in your phone, right. After the model has been trained and the models have been trained and all the weights in the neural nets have been correctly adapted. Right. So you don't need huge power if you're not training the model and you can get pretrained models. So again, the horizon, or it's up to you of how far you want to get into that.
00:35:07.486 - 00:35:13.026, Speaker A: So, yeah, I recommend to you and to everybody trying to do it, to definitely just jump on it.
00:35:13.048 - 00:35:49.126, Speaker B: Quite surreal that this is a possibility in the future, in the quite near future, just like how storage was incredibly expensive and it was just basically incredibly expensive, 1gb like a couple of decades ago. Now it's just a kind of standard. Right. And it's going to be the same with AI at some point where its size isn't going to matter as much as now. It's just going to be kind of integrated into anything. But, yeah, I think that whole thing is quite interesting. And you've basically built a SaaS around this, right, as well, where people just put in SaaS.
00:35:49.126 - 00:35:57.198, Speaker B: Yeah. And you basically put in the solidity code and it just finds the vulnerabilities. Right. It just spits them out. Is that kind of correct?
00:35:57.284 - 00:36:21.014, Speaker A: It's actually more like your direction as well, more or less. There are only 3%, 4% of all the smart contracts out there that have their solidity code verified. Right. All the rest are directly bytecode. So we said again, we are post deployment and we don't want to capture 60% of 4% of all the smart contracts. That doesn't sound too. Yeah.
00:36:21.014 - 00:37:01.214, Speaker A: So we act directly in the bytecode and as you probably know, even the bytecode pre deployment and post deployment is not the same. So we already have an edge of it's good that you use static and dynamic and formal analyzers and verification techniques, but however, the bytecode itself is different. Even your DevOps or your deployment options, you did not pay attention to extinct. That happened to, was it to euler finance or something like that? Hugely. And it was to a deployment. Exactly. So anyways, I don't want to point any fingers at protocols that might not have been hacked.
00:37:01.214 - 00:37:30.774, Speaker A: So sorry if that wasn't the one, but it was someone as big as them for sure. The company is quite simple. They simply give us the address of the smart contracts. Per smart contract, we build them every month the same. So far we do that, we do it in fiat. But next pen testify will be a DAO in the future. As soon as zero knowledge proofs become a bit more powerful for AI.
00:37:30.774 - 00:37:53.102, Speaker A: At that point we'll make a DaO out of it, and it will be everything ether based or any native currency based. We build per smart contract, per company, per month, and in a monthly basis in kind of the traditional startup way before it is transformed into a Dow.
00:37:53.166 - 00:38:20.170, Speaker B: One thing that I have noticed, trying to basically set up my model for sales is that if you do do this kind of bytecode thing and you do like a SaaS, right, some malicious user could come in and put in the contract and see if there's a vulnerability. Then you basically spit it out to them and then they can use it. Right? Like a black hat can come in and do it. How do you basically avoid legal implications when it comes to these kind of players?
00:38:21.230 - 00:38:56.166, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very good question. But of course, there are always a solution to a problem. You probably learned that in entrepreneurship, there is a solution to everything. One of them that we use is you're only able to input the address of the smart contract that you are now an owner of. And if that smart contract, for any reason, doesn't have a precise owner, you have to verify that you still are in control of that. It could be by the domain extension or several more things that we already have in the pipeline. However, you mentioned something as well.
00:38:56.166 - 00:39:34.254, Speaker A: A second point, quite smart, which is even if you're the right user, right. You don't have any kind of malevolent intentions, right. Bad intentions to hurting any other smart contract, or the smart contract for the company you work for, right. You might want to scan it and then say, all right, it's done. I'm only going to pay $10 per smart contract, but I'm going to use it less than a month. So it might even be for free. The thing that we do offer is, again, we've already thought that you've already done all the static, dynamic formal verifications.
00:39:34.254 - 00:40:39.554, Speaker A: If you haven't, then you're going to be more useful, you're going to find more errors in our tool. But we already suppose the user has gone through that. And the main value that we give to the user is that continuous monitoring. That means that we save all the expert vulnerable patterns, we call them, and those are the multi sensory patterns that are vulnerable using different models of AI in house at Pentapsify. So we store all of this in the database, and if any other smart contract in the world gets hacked using a, gets hacked that had a similar pattern, the team immediately gets notified. So that means that we are, so to say, a worldwide oracle or observer of everything that happens worldwide for a smart contract when they get hacked. And if they have a similar vulnerable pattern, the team gets immediately notified before they get hacked.
00:40:39.554 - 00:41:05.090, Speaker A: So that is the main advantage of that continuous monitoring. This is why we are not extremely expensive. We build $10 per smart contract, which is not going to break your bank, even if you're a protocol with thousands of smart contracts. It's not a lot per month, but it is definitely enough to definitely worth the price for getting that worldwide oracle of vulnerabilities and get immediately notified when that happens.
00:41:05.240 - 00:41:09.540, Speaker B: It's actually quite cheap. $10. You would not see this anywhere else, I think.
00:41:10.390 - 00:41:11.778, Speaker A: Exactly, yeah.
00:41:11.944 - 00:41:22.834, Speaker B: But I want to switch the topic over to kind around building a business, since you have had successful ones and also failures, which is I think necessary for any successful business owner.
00:41:22.882 - 00:41:23.640, Speaker A: Of course.
00:41:24.330 - 00:41:46.478, Speaker B: I would like to ask, how did you really start these all up basically by yourself? Were you solo or did you get like a partner and then basically expanding into sort of a greater, more scalable or scaled up team structure, kind of wearing multiple hats and then designating what needs to be done?
00:41:46.564 - 00:42:34.400, Speaker A: No, for sure. If I were to simplify the journey, it would be solo, co founder and then community. The current one is community, and I'll explain in detail whatever each one means. And so the solo at the beginning, I began freelancing, building websites full stack and securing them right after I said, you're probably not going to encounter many full stack freelancers with expert knowledge in cyber, so for sure, at least you won't get hacked. And I'm going to build your react angular website. That was again many years ago. Pretty much as soon as angular came out, react didn't even exist at that time.
00:42:34.400 - 00:43:10.934, Speaker A: So yeah, I started doing that and that actually taught me a lot about how to talk to clients. Each experience taught me like several key things. And being a freelancer, full stack dev again, I was young teenager, taught me how to really, I made all the mistakes possible, how to communicate late, how not to talk to clients. I did all those mistakes and I corrected them. So I really learned how important communication is, whether with clients or with other people in my team. And at that time it was only me. So it was mostly how to talk to clients.
00:43:10.934 - 00:44:07.834, Speaker A: Right after, I had a historic, essential mentor that recommended me to, in order not to sell myself twice, right, to get an academic degree. At that time, I didn't even go to university. And I did electronics and computer science, and then a master in cybersecurity, infosec with blockchain at UCL. So during that time, I actually created my second company, the one I exited. And the main points at that time, I was a technical founder, CTO, and the roles, really the hats that I had to wear were multiple. I was one of the co founders that led the fundraising process. So something that I hadn't really done before, I was as well, actively in hiring new people, something that I had never done before.
00:44:07.834 - 00:45:24.386, Speaker A: I had to learn how different nationalities think and like to talk about things, money, clients, partnerships, especially around the German, the French, the British, Spanish, the Americans. So really learning the difference between them both and what they value, I would say that was my biggest take. So how to really start managing a team and how to really smell the intentions of people, I would say that was really mostly soft skills and even actually self protection, so to say, in my second company. And then at the end, by then, I had already mastered how to hire, how to manage a team, and most importantly, how to do that remotely with six plus hours of time difference. So when I jumped directly into pen testify, I already learned a new concept, that the world was changing, and that was community. Overnight, you can have a thousand new employees called contributors in your protocol, right? You don't have to deal with HR yet, you don't have to deal with legal yet. And I do believe that is one of the biggest advantages of community.
00:45:24.386 - 00:46:20.614, Speaker A: I'm not saying Pentaci is for the community. In fact, it is our biggest objective and next steps right now. But I've definitely learned a lot, and I'm still trying to master how to harness the power of community and a talented team at Pentasify. And I'm fortunate enough that I have, again, UCL on my side with one of the best professors and researchers in the world in terms of in the field of smart contract security, blockchain, cryptography and AI, I mean, at the end of the day, DeepMind, which was bought by Google, Opensai, one of OpenAI's biggest competitor, came from UCL, the founders. So there is a lot of talent right there, and I'm quite fortunate to have them right now in this journey. So, yeah, I'm really learning. The next step for me is how to harness the power of community.
00:46:20.812 - 00:47:00.660, Speaker B: Yeah, 100% agree. Community can be an amazing thing and it can really break or make a company as well. Without a community or. Yeah, basically without a community that wants to use your product or even contribute, help, build it in a way where people want to use it, market it and promote it, there's not going to be a company, an underlying company. Right. It's just exactly kind of a project without users. Users is the main factor for any company, and that's what you should focus on, because without the users there's no income and without income there's no company.
00:47:01.750 - 00:47:02.500, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:47:04.550 - 00:47:27.500, Speaker B: But, yeah, I think one thing you did touch on was understanding different nationalities and what they value. I think I've never heard anybody kind of mention that before. Your own protection. Right. Is that kind of to gauge what their underlying intentions are or. Yes, something completely different?
00:47:30.510 - 00:48:53.638, Speaker A: It is mostly to, as you said, business is purely social based, good business is there to serve and offer value, and of course the monetary is just a byproduct, but it's mainly offer value to other humans, whether it's b, two b, two b, two c, two c, whatever it is. So when, I mean, learning how different communities and countries operate and mostly their mindsets, their underlying philosophy and ways of thinking, is mostly to let them know that they are important to us, that we understand their needs, and most importantly, that we are trustworthy. So to give you an example, and that we are compatible, you can be trustworthy, but not want to be with a partner, with a girlfriend or whatever it is, because you don't trust them, or even if you trust them, maybe they're not compatible with who you are. To make sure that was never the case. Right, I had to really get to know what was important to them, in which case, for example, one of the main differences that I saw about the US is, for example, speed, as well as business size, it is that they value quite a lot. Everything moves extremely fast and in extremely big dimensions. In the UK, the British, they value.
00:48:53.638 - 00:49:30.340, Speaker A: Yeah. What they want to see is whether they like a technology or not. How likely is that technology to be omnipresent in the world. And if so, let us help you. So you have to tell them what value you bring and how that value is going to be important to them, even if it goes against them. See, UK is a country that fascinates me in one side, it's an extremely traditional, classist country, but at the same time, they have a dynamism, right, and ways of thinking that are extremely flexible and agile. So I really value.
00:49:30.340 - 00:50:06.958, Speaker A: Yeah, and then Spain, they, well, they're very different between them. But France, for example, they value a lot the individuals rights and the well being of the users and kind of the safety around the product. So if you really tailor what you say during the negotiations to those things, you can really make the person believe in you. And most importantly, show that you care enough about their culture to be compatible with them. And hence what you're offering is the same, is an image of who you are. So at least in a startup, when you're early stage, that's a big thing.
00:50:07.124 - 00:50:33.814, Speaker B: Okay, so that's very insightful. I've never heard of that, and it's actually quite deep, I think, that nobody even considers. Right. And I think this would be especially important for vcs. So knowing what kind of vcs their values are, I've never really delved into that game. But you have, and I would love to know more about negotiations that happen, how to basically sell your idea and get people on board.
00:50:33.932 - 00:51:39.274, Speaker A: For vcs, the game is definitely for vcs, the game is a little bit different because they're a very good, I mean, thanks to them, the startups, many of the startups are alive. So they are a fundamental arm of the government of a country, or of corporations. If we talk cvcs to of course, make this community alive, so they're extremely essential for startups. However, sometimes you really have to know that you're playing a different game when you're talking to vcs. And one thing that I see repetitively is how biased they might be comparing old technologies to new ones. And I do believe that they will need to radically change their paradigm, no pun intended, by the way, in the past, really no pointing fingers at no one, honestly speaking, but they really have to change their mindset into truly understanding how the technology is going to change and not how it's changing the world. That's what they were focusing on.
00:51:39.274 - 00:52:49.282, Speaker A: But also, we live in a world of blockchain. If we put Ethereum as the main, simply because that's the main technologies that I use, it might be different from other people. But in the DFI sector, at least 75% are Ethereum based or Ethereum compatible blockchains. Right? So using that as an example, the whole eips, right, one of the whole eips dilemma is if you really understand the future potential changes of blockchain, you might avoid many vcs from investing into an idea, into a company, even if they have an already existing mvp or product that might be completely washed out by an EIP update. And for all of you that don't know what EIP is, it's simply Ethereum improvement proposals. So those are new changes to the blockchain that might completely ignore or be incompatible with your protocol. Right? So always watch out for if you're doing an MEV, for example, company, how are future eips going to change MeV in the future? Right? So I'm a big fan of EIP and I always keep up to date with that.
00:52:49.282 - 00:53:13.738, Speaker A: Happy to answer any questions about that. But it is essential for vcs to know and understand the technology, how Ethereum creates a deflationary product, let's say how different improvements proposals will change or invalidate many of their portfolios companies and become technical more than as much as business.
00:53:13.904 - 00:53:38.734, Speaker B: So you basically got to explain the overall architecture and what's the competitors like, what are your basically benefits compared to them, and how you can change the whole space, or at least outcompete, I guess, is another way. And I think another thing to touch on is how do you even find these kind of people willing to invest money in experiments?
00:53:38.782 - 00:54:06.122, Speaker A: Basically, that's a fair question, especially for those starting out. First of all, there are different kinds of individuals willing to give you money. There is the FFF, friends, family and fools. That is normally the first round of investment that you might get. The second one is Bas business angels. Those are individuals, single individuals. Maybe they're Bas consortiums as well.
00:54:06.122 - 00:54:54.042, Speaker A: Not vcs, BA consortiums or collectives. They are. Imagine one person, previous co founder or current co founder of a successful protocol that is already a three x entrepreneur, already knows how their game works and wants to pick different stocks and believe in the market. Probably because they received it was life saving, a VA investment that they had in the past. So they want to give back to the community. So finding those individuals well, first of all, knowing that they exist is the first step. And the second one is through programs like incubators, through pages like Twitter, is starting to become a place for bas to recruit to see how the market is.
00:54:54.042 - 00:56:01.118, Speaker A: But in our case, we got incubated by Station F, which allegedly is the world's largest incubator. So at least it's big. And we were selected there at top 40 future 40. So from the thousand startups that they have every year or two years they select 40, the most successful ones or with the most potential, and they give one of the perks, for example, is passing along their current network of BAs and VCs, kind of a list of startups, right? And the last group is VCs or CVCs, corporate vcs being the latter. And some of them require you to complete a form online and there is no other way to contact them. Another way is doing a tiered method, knowing how to reach out with tier three vcs that might not be ideal for you, and walking up that ladder through recommendations, warm intros and so on. So that's a good option as well, for sure.
00:56:01.204 - 00:56:08.340, Speaker B: And what are the really benefits of getting these people on board and getting money from them in exchange for I guess, equity in your.
00:56:10.550 - 00:56:50.570, Speaker A: Mean. As Ray Delio said, one of the biggest hedge fund managers, I think he's retired now, but he's definitely on a mission to educate people in this matter. Is getting funded means mainly two things. First of all, the stamp, the recognition of trust for other companies to say this vc has trust in me. And not only that, I have a huge community now that I belong to, I am visible to the rest. You pass from private to public and that is already, as I said, a stamp. The second one is it accelerates your productivity.
00:56:50.570 - 00:57:44.878, Speaker A: You buy productivity instead of being slow on growth, you buy literally your productivity to accelerate the product, to accelerate the growth and whether it's the product of the growth. It really depends on every stage. There is precede one hundred k, two hundred k, one mil. There is seed 510 mil, there is series a 2030 and so on, BCD and all the different mixes. So those things give you that trust, that network, and most importantly that stamp. However, one little note that I would like to make is many people do think that visa is the only option and they only think in terms of size. And again, not to point fingers at anybody, but really that depends on the culture of each country, right? So there are many companies that could have been extremely successful without VC fundraise.
00:57:44.878 - 00:58:29.994, Speaker A: And most importantly, VC fundraise is not going to accelerate whether you fail fast or you succeed fast. It is only if your startup, that idea, the team, or whether you still have more to learn or whatever reason it might be totally respectable reason. Of course, taking a VC on board, it's actually going to lead to a slower death. And more problems and more stress and actually PTSD of entrepreneurship. So I'm actually starting to change slightly my mindset towards vcs. Not to not get them, but rather double think, double question at first whether you can really grow organically. Prove to the world that your idea there is a little piece of wood, in other words, your mvp, that is burning.
00:58:29.994 - 00:59:05.834, Speaker A: In other words, users using it successfully, that whenever you get vc, you're just adding more wood to the fire. Right. Which only leads to one thing, more fire. So as long as you truly have balanced your options and you know that VC is the only way, then do it. But otherwise do not take that as the status quo of I'm an entrepreneur, where's the next call for the VC? Because growing organically, it is ultimately an extremely respectable option and it leads to more stability in the future, less conflict and things like that.
00:59:05.872 - 00:59:08.700, Speaker B: If you don't need vcs, basically don't take them.
00:59:09.550 - 00:59:10.202, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:59:10.336 - 00:59:11.478, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:59:11.584 - 00:59:30.340, Speaker A: Think three times before you take vcs because you might need to prove to yourself that the idea works by itself and actually by putting yourself at risk in difficulties, you're truly going to learn and accelerate that whole truth of the mvp that sometimes money kind of fogs away.
00:59:30.790 - 01:00:01.820, Speaker B: You don't want to be blinded by. Okay, we have an idea, let's get some money involved and try and build this. But then later down the road, figure out that the idea doesn't work and now you're stuck with the money and dealing with all these people. Right, exactly. Yeah, I definitely agree with that. And I think I'm taking the kind of route where it's organic. I don't see a need for vcs and it doesn't kind of improve anything when I'm basically building the whole architecture and still figuring out what to do at a fundamental level.
01:00:01.820 - 01:00:51.546, Speaker B: Money doesn't change that in any way, apart from, I guess, bringing someone else aboard to think and think full time with me. But yeah, that's also another challenge in itself, finding the right people and people with aligned values and intentions, which can take away from the time being spent on the product. Right. But yeah, I think this has been incredibly insightful and I have learned quite a bit and I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have. But we are getting, of course, we have gone over a little bit, but it's been a pleasure meeting you and talking to you for the first time. And I hope and testify it explodes with success. I'm sure there's a lot of great things coming in the future with the AI cybersecurity field, and I'm super intrigued to see how that plays out down the line.
01:00:51.648 - 01:01:13.730, Speaker A: Absolutely. And thank you very much for having me here. It's been a real pleasure to see as well a fellow security engineer. Best of luck with your startup. For sure you're into something big. It is only down to execution. I can already smell the passion from the microphone away, so for sure, I already can see you've already succeeded at this.
01:01:13.730 - 01:01:57.402, Speaker A: It is only the byproduct that you're waiting for and that explosion is to come for sure. And yeah, regarding the journey, I'm very happy as well to potentially help people that listen to this podcast whenever. If you hear this and you're going to the Defi security summit, I'll be there, or Dapcon later on this year, in October or in September, sorry, in Berlin, I'll be there as well as a speaker, so more than happy to mix with you or with either of your listeners and talk about it, or simply on Twitter as well. LMC security, I recently started creating a small community, so, yeah, happy to do that as well.
01:01:57.556 - 01:02:09.240, Speaker B: Yeah, depending on when this comes out, hopefully before all that stuff. But yeah, man, it's been a great pleasure and I'm definitely going to keep in touch with you. I think we're on the same kind of path, but maybe a little diverging a little bit.
01:02:10.250 - 01:02:11.190, Speaker A: That's good.
01:02:11.340 - 01:02:13.640, Speaker B: Yeah, we don't want to compete too much.
01:02:15.850 - 01:02:34.350, Speaker A: For sure. And even so, the space is too big just to people. So again, everything is. Competition is absolutely good. Better than nothing, I believe. So it's been a real pleasure and thank you again for this opportunity. And hopefully you or other people get some value out of this.
01:02:34.350 - 01:02:39.280, Speaker A: Hopefully it was of value for some people. That's at the end, the objective of it all, isn't it?
01:02:40.130 - 01:02:47.518, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. And on that note, I would like to say thank you for listening and have a good night or day, everyone.
01:02:47.684 - 01:02:48.378, Speaker A: Thank you. Bye.
