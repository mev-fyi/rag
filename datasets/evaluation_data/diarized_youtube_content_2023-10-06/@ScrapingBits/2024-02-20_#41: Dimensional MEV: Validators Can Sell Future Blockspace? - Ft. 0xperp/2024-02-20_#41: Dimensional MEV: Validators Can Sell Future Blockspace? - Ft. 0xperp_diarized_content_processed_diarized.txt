00:00:00.810 - 00:00:21.338, Speaker A: I think the solution to that is DVT. I could operate a validator with three or four separate parties. I might have like Coinbase and like block Damon as operators or shared keyholders of my validator and then some type of smart contract, multi sig, smart account kind of thing where I can enter into a contract with you and you can take over the control of my validator.

Maximize your eth staking value with me V exclusively on MeV IO and composable execute any intent on any chain. Coming soon to Mantis app. That's mantisap Gm Gm everyone. My name is Degachi, the host of scraping bits, and today I'm with Nate and it going friend.
00:00:50.948 - 00:00:54.542, Speaker A: Fantastic. I'm glad to finally get this on the calendar and hop on here.
00:00:54.596 - 00:01:01.198, Speaker B: I'm glad you came on. We had to shuffle it around a few times. We're finally here. And just for the people that don't know who you are, who are you and what do you do?
00:01:01.284 - 00:01:55.414, Speaker A: Yeah, so I operate adjacent as something on the side. I also have a full time job as well. But over the last two years here, I've been in crypto for a while, and over the last two years I've gotten super interested in two categories, which are infrastructure that is needed to operate a lot of these defi protocols. This starts with validators and sequencers and stuff. But once you start looking at other infrastructure components that are needed, you start to talk about liquidators and capers and fillers and various arbitrage bots and all of that, right? And I think a lot of that can be chalked up to Mev and stuff. Then when you start to look at some other exchanges or defi protocols that don't have as much usage as others, it's like, okay, well at the end of the day, founding team is running the keepers and fillers or liquidators for it, right? So for teams that we support, we like to operate infrastructure with them and alongside them. And then the second category is this kind of emerging d five trend of new or differentiated approaches to the derivative markets.
00:01:55.414 - 00:02:36.586, Speaker A: Whether that is interesting approaches to options or perps in terms of the actual construction of the markets and the physical instruments, or in just kind of like the general category of bringing these derivatives on chain. I think that the tagline quote is when you look at tradfi markets, derivatives trade at like ten x, the volume of spot or something like that. And when you look at the derivative markets in crypto, especially when you look at them in terms of DFI derivative markets, they're a fraction of the spot. So those are kind of our two general interests. And we operate infrastructure around that. Write research around the derivatives side and the different approaches, as well as do some manual and automated trading around those DeFi protocols.
00:02:36.778 - 00:02:52.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I had someone else on before that's creating an options kind of platform, and he used to do statistical mev, like statistical arbitrage mev. And he's building Baloram, which is like a permissionless options platform. So it kind of sounds like you're dabbling in the same kind of field.
00:02:52.072 - 00:02:52.370, Speaker C: Right.
00:02:52.440 - 00:03:00.098, Speaker B: If derivatives is the same options, I'm not actually too smart at that. So I guess what is a TLDR on derivatives and perpetuals?
00:03:00.194 - 00:03:15.446, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. We are definitely operating the same space as valerome is. We're just like the end user rather than the founder of the. Yeah, I mean, like derivatives is kind of like a pretty open field, I would say, especially when it comes to pretty well established in the tradfi markets.
00:03:15.478 - 00:03:15.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:15.648 - 00:04:17.118, Speaker A: But when it comes to implementing them within deFi, there's kind of a lot of different approaches you can take. And that does kind of come to one of the more interesting parts of what we do, which is kind of like, there's not much standardization across the derivatives markets outside of perps, which leads to differentiated market or instrument construction. But I guess the TLDR is like, there's really one primary derivative that people trade in, crypto, which is a perp, a perpetual future, as opposed to what is much more commonly known as an expiring future, or like a fixed future, which would be, you generally trade these fixed futures in the commodity markets, oil, corn, orange concentrate. And the primary difference from going from the fixed to the perpetual or non expiring, where there's not like an expiry date, has been kind of this introduction of the funding rate, which when it was kind of introduced back in the day, was a weird component, right? Oh, all of a sudden, every hour or every 8 hours or whatever, there's this variable rate that I may receive or I may have to pay.
00:04:17.284 - 00:04:17.662, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:17.716 - 00:04:48.902, Speaker A: But in turn, what it provides us is this really nice way to get leverage on either direction of the market on just about any asset, right. I feel like a lot of people on chain that do a majority of their trading on chain right now are generally just spot based, right. They're buying stuff off uniswap or vlR, amms, whatever, but anyone really trading on a centralized exchange outside of those that are geo restricted, or if you're outside the, like, you're probably just trading perps on binance. It's just kind of the most liquid market. It provides you a lot of know. It's very easy to like, how does it work?
00:04:48.956 - 00:04:52.874, Speaker B: If I wanted to buy a perp, what does that mean? And how do I make money from it?
00:04:52.912 - 00:05:29.158, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So at the most basic level, a perp just tracks like an index rate of the underlying or the spot asset. So if we were talking about like bitcoin perp, the bitcoin perp is going to track the spot price of bitcoin, right? And for very liquid markets, it's essentially the exact same. It tracks it really, really well. And that's the same thing with regards to a normal future market, right? Like normal futures track the price of the underlying, but they have this time component, right. I could buy like a six month out future, which would track the expected value of the asset over the next six months. Perps do not have that.
00:05:29.158 - 00:06:29.942, Speaker A: The funding rate is what kind of like tethers, if you will, the price of the perp to the spot or the underlying, right. In a normal future, the time or the expiration time is kind of what tethers that rate closer to the underlying price, right. If I was to buy like a six month future now, it might have a few percentage difference in price, but as I approach six months, the price of that future should essentially be the same price as spot. Similarly, on the perp side, since there is no expiration, the funding rate is really what tethers the price back to spot. So a walkthrough of the funding rate would be something like, let's say bitcoin is trading at 30,000, and maybe the perp is trading at like should be a way to incentivize more traders to short the perp, so that the price closer to 30,000, which is the underlying. So the funding rate will be skewed towards those shorting, meaning that the long side pays the shorts. So you might see like a funding rate of a few percentages points, or a 10th of a percentage point or something like that.
00:06:29.942 - 00:06:51.498, Speaker A: It's kind of based on what time the exchange settles it. Some exchanges settle it every hour, some eight, some 24, and how they represent it. Sometimes people represent it as like a yearly apy, or sometimes people represent it within the time of the settle. So if I was someone that had longed bitcoin at 31k every hour, I might have to pay 1% of my balance to those that are shorting.
00:06:51.674 - 00:06:52.158, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:52.244 - 00:07:01.874, Speaker A: And the whole idea is to incentivize longs to close their position and or shorts to enter the position so that the actual price of the perp more accurately reflects the spot price.
00:07:01.992 - 00:07:06.706, Speaker B: Okay, got you. And what is the real benefit of the perps and the macro game?
00:07:06.808 - 00:07:07.122, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:07.176 - 00:07:13.090, Speaker A: So probably twofold for the first fold is it allows you to easily long and short an asset.
00:07:13.170 - 00:07:13.558, Speaker C: Okay.
00:07:13.644 - 00:07:30.474, Speaker A: If I wanted to short some asset on chain right now, where there maybe isn't a well built out perp or other derivative market for it, I'd probably have to do some type of interactions with a lending protocol. I'd have to hope that someone would be willing to lend to me and your variable on the rate on that side.
00:07:30.512 - 00:07:30.666, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:30.688 - 00:07:34.186, Speaker A: So it becomes like a much easier way to short an asset.
00:07:34.298 - 00:07:34.766, Speaker C: Okay.
00:07:34.868 - 00:07:52.850, Speaker A: And additionally, it's not the actual spot asset, and it's just tracking the underlying price. Given the margining system of whatever exchange you're using, it allows you to easily apply leverage. So it's pretty common to get like two and a half, 510 x leverage, whatever, if you're going crazy on rollbit 100 x leverage or something like that.
00:07:52.920 - 00:07:53.266, Speaker C: But yeah.
00:07:53.288 - 00:07:54.562, Speaker A: So those are the two main benefits.
00:07:54.696 - 00:08:13.686, Speaker B: Now that I know this, I think there's got to be some mechanism to prevent someone flash loaning and manipulating the underlying pool. It depends on the asset class. Like if it's a shitcoin, right, and you've built perps on this, you could probably flash loan, inflate the underlying and then wouldn't that cause the perps to get artificially manipulated?
00:08:13.878 - 00:08:31.934, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is interesting, right? So not exactly a flash loan, but you might remember like a little bit ago, I think his name was like Avi. He was like the mango exploiter on Solana, right? He did something similar on mango. He spiked the price and he had the long sitting on binance or something. So he just deposited a lot on both platforms and manipulated it like that.
00:08:31.972 - 00:08:32.126, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:32.148 - 00:08:35.774, Speaker A: And obviously he's got all this legal action and stuff against him for manipulation and all that stuff.
00:08:35.812 - 00:08:36.074, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:36.132 - 00:08:52.822, Speaker A: But it definitely has happened. They can be manipulated more given the leverage and the longing and shorting that's available. I wouldn't say it's any more easier to manipulate than a lending and borrowing market or something like that. And I guess we have seen manipulation and problems with lending and borrowing markets and flash loans before.
00:08:52.876 - 00:08:53.190, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:53.260 - 00:09:07.338, Speaker B: It's like all oracle based in some way, which is, I think, one of the biggest attack vectors. It's just like a dependency on an oracle and we have this thing where you can borrow multimillions and then interact with that. Nobody really takes accounts of it. So yeah, it's quite interesting.
00:09:07.424 - 00:09:39.654, Speaker A: Yeah, we're starting to see now Florum and stuff has oracle lists and we're starting to see some other protocols and other derivative protocols come out with kind of like a primary framing that their main benefit is their oracle free. This is a little bit more in the option space. You can see primitive. They have their replicated market makers and panoptic kind of has their replicated Uniswap v three option payoffs. But you can start to see this kind of push towards oracle free stuff, which is pretty cool to kind of see those markets develop.
00:09:39.772 - 00:09:44.466, Speaker B: And now that we know the underlying derivatives and petrols, what are you doing now? Adjacent?
00:09:44.578 - 00:09:44.950, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:45.020 - 00:10:51.638, Speaker A: So as we see these brand new implementations of markets, especially when they are trying to introduce oracle free stuff, there's often really interesting trades that could be set up either just people aren't really as in tune to how that given market has been set up or instrument has been set up. They just aren't interested in it for one way or another. But some of them that we've done in the past that are interesting or can give you a feel for trades or things that we might be interested in going forward are the open team. It might be like about a year ago now released this product called squeaf, right, which is based on the power perpetual paper that came out of paradigm. The idea is it basically just tracks eth squared, the price of what ETH squared would be, and that has certain benefits as a trader that purely wants to just long squeath and get outsized exposure relative to straight two x leverage, right? But there was this interesting relationship between power perps and squeath, traditional options, right? So stuff that you might trade on like derbit and lp positions on unisoft b three. And the interesting relationship kind of comes with all three of those can be broken down into greeks. And Greeks are metrics.
00:10:51.638 - 00:10:56.634, Speaker A: They're like easy to understand rate of change and how option prices move relative to other factors.
00:10:56.682 - 00:10:56.894, Speaker C: Right?
00:10:56.932 - 00:11:56.850, Speaker A: So all three of these products can be broken down into those greeks, meaning that if I have specific greeks or metrics on each one of them, they can easily be traded against each other. So you could even think of something like, for example, I'm going to say I'm trading in this case it would be eth, right? Like say I have like an ETh USDC LP pair at a certain tick range on unisoft e three and I'm going to combine that with selling a put, and I'm going to combine that with longing squeak or something like that. And it kind of just is this triangular arbitrage capturing value across them. And the interesting thing is those grief values should all kind of be similarly priced any given time, right, given they are similar instruments. But it was kind of never really the case. And a lot of that is just due to lack of understanding the relationship between them or lack of users on squeaf side, or the fact that on the uniswap side, fees never really compensate lps as much as they should, or due to some mispricing on Durbit. There's always just kind of these interesting peculiarities between all of them.
00:11:56.920 - 00:12:15.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds very complex, man. It just sounds like a massive rabbit hole of just on the surface level, it's very getting complex. So how long did it really take you to learn all this stuff is what I'm interested in. If someone wanted to get into derivatives, perpetuals, et cetera, what would you do to get to where you're at now, but in a faster way?
00:12:15.500 - 00:12:56.322, Speaker A: I mean, I do think it is generally complex, but it's really not like if you've been kind of immersed in it for a while, right? So that's kind of what I just did. I kind of realized two years ago, I don't think, I'm not really a good trader per se, of actually understanding. I'm going to go scalp some perps and stuff, right? But I had a lot of interest in new market design and instruments and stuff. So the first thing I did was I built like an awesome list. And this is kind of how I've learned stuff going forward. So on my GitHub, I just have awesome defi derivatives. And I mean, it's just a huge, huge list of papers and people's writings and tweets and tons of different protocols and all their documentation for how they might go about implementing stuff.
00:12:56.322 - 00:13:57.302, Speaker A: So as I was aggregating all of that, I obviously read through all of the content and kind of put it together, put it out. And this is actually how I started getting some initial traction on Twitter as well, like posting these awesome lists and some threads, explaining some of the protocols and stuff. And then from that awesome list, I would write like 10,000 or so word blog post about differences between protocols similarities, which ones I think are more interesting than others, and the general state of that market in that regard, the DFI derivative market. And I think through that I kind of understood a good amount of where stuff's at. I also then set up some telegram channels and I'm a really heavy user of Twitter lists. So I'd like start curating every single new defi derivative protocol into a list and just tracking every single new release and where it's at. I'd reach out to the founders or they'd reach out to me and we just kind of chat a little bit about each new market and stuff and then really? Yeah, from there, just kind of picking up this information after setting up really good base understanding and kind of like good rails in terms of information coming in.
00:13:57.356 - 00:14:33.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's true of everything. I have experience as well. I'm going through the phase of researching through papers, which is kind of a new kind of field to me. But it's very interesting because that's what a lot of the innovation is in terms of the theoretical side, which aren't necessarily implemented in the engineering side, it's more of just like, oh, this is theoretically possible, but we haven't done it. And you can kind of scope out what hasn't been done if you have a creative mind and you have a grand idea of the whole scene is what I've kind of realized as well. So it is definitely a great way immerse yourself in whatever field you want to get good at. Right.
00:14:33.730 - 00:14:42.838, Speaker B: Before this talk, you mentioned block space derivatives, which I think I've heard before in terms of selling block space, but that's probably not what this is.
00:14:43.004 - 00:15:27.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, our primary focus at the moment, we have kind of our prior strategies and stuff, but I think this is kind of the newest frontier or most emerging product at the moment. But block space derivatives or things relating to them have kind of been around for a little bit now. Back in the day, we could trade the one inch gas token, right? I think a lot of people have maybe put out stuff around. Even now it's private order flow through a builder or something. Basically, let's say like, hey, I'm going to pay you a little bit upfront so I can have the space in this block going forward. All of that stuff, I think makes a lot more sense and can be considered a little bit related to this in terms of the actual physical usage of the block space and trading of it. What I mean is a little bit more of like trading the demand for it.
00:15:27.490 - 00:16:03.162, Speaker A: And this can kind of come out in a few ways, especially on the ETH side, but we're interested in both the ETH side and on the bitcoin side. So I'm happy to kind of run through both of them because they're both very different markets from each other. So on the e side, if I were to say I wanted to trade the demand for a given block going forward, that block has like a few components, which are the price of ETH, the subsidy of the block, and most importantly for ETH, the MEV fees captured in that block, which vary between somewhere between 20 or 60 or obviously, if it's a huge tip of the overall subsidy of that block.
00:16:03.226 - 00:16:03.742, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:03.876 - 00:16:17.202, Speaker A: And that kind of means that as a validator, you have pretty variable income. If we're talking in terms of USD, you don't really know what you're making that day. You might have, like an outsized tip. You can a ton, or you can make maybe like the average.
00:16:17.266 - 00:16:17.590, Speaker C: Right?
00:16:17.660 - 00:16:48.638, Speaker A: A lot of these derivatives make a lot of more sense from like, a validator perspective. If I were to give you the example that you're a validator, or if you're operating a set of validators or whatever, and maybe you were expected to make like $500 this month, that's just kind of what you kind of forecasted at the start of the month. And I say, okay, well, if you give me that revenue, I'll give you $475 right now. This is a way for you to lock in your revenue both before you earn it, but also as a way to lock in for sure. You're making $475. If eth's price collapses in half, like by the end of the month, you're going to make 250.
00:16:48.724 - 00:16:49.118, Speaker C: Right?
00:16:49.204 - 00:17:09.926, Speaker A: If for some reason, across your data centers or your cloud providers or whatever, you had some outages and stuff, you may not receive your income because your vowages might have as much uptime, right? Vice versa, I'm paying you 475 for future income. That could have significant price increases. You could receive like a few e mev tip. And that's all the stuff I'm betting on.
00:17:09.948 - 00:17:35.102, Speaker B: And I would receive the immediate flaw I've seen. That is, first of all, you don't know in advance who's going to be the one confirming the block, like the validator confirming it. So how would you deal with that, right? If you're saying, okay, from this validator, if you somehow knew deterministically that this guy is going to be the validator and let's say the 10th block from now and then you wanted to sell this, that would theoretically work, but you don't know that, so how does that work?
00:17:35.156 - 00:17:53.810, Speaker A: Yeah, and by the way, the protocol that we're interested in on this eat side would be alchemia for anyone that is interested in something like this as well. They're currently in beta, so you have to think about it a little bit outside of that specific numbered block and more so I might expect my set of validators hit somewhere between three and five blocks this month.
00:17:53.880 - 00:17:54.258, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:54.344 - 00:17:59.926, Speaker A: Doesn't really matter what block it is. I think they're going to make about like three to five this month. And based off of that, it's not.
00:17:59.948 - 00:18:07.366, Speaker B: Really like determining what block it is, it's just when it happens or if it happens. I have the right to this, basically.
00:18:07.548 - 00:18:47.350, Speaker A: Yeah. It's like you're not trading a specific block or a specific spot in a block, which I think is kind of like more so what has been maybe tried in the past or is what people are into now with buying specific block space from builders and stuff. But this is more just like kind of like derivatives on top of that, or abstracted a little bit away from that, where it's like, I really care about the validator's revenue coming in. They forecast that their revenue is going to be somewhere between three and five blocks in a month. I think that they might only hit three. Or I think that eth's price going to go up, or I think that there's going to be a large NFT mint and there's going to be increased mev activity in that month. So I think that their subsidy will actually go up and I actually want to purchase that revenue from them forward.
00:18:47.420 - 00:18:53.046, Speaker B: Looking like pay them before it's even happened, just to get whatever happens when it happens.
00:18:53.228 - 00:18:54.946, Speaker A: Exactly. It's kind of confusing.
00:18:54.978 - 00:18:55.126, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:55.148 - 00:19:21.070, Speaker A: So this one would be the instrument and it is a little bit confusing. But essentially, for me as a trader here, on a given month, I might have specific views on where I think the price is going, where I think the overall number of ETh stakers are in a given month, or it's just pretty much up. Only where I think the rolling average of mev tips might be in a given month.
00:19:21.140 - 00:19:21.710, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:21.860 - 00:19:24.718, Speaker A: And I might only put that trade on like a few times a year.
00:19:24.804 - 00:19:25.150, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:25.220 - 00:19:32.702, Speaker A: And it maybe doesn't even warrant me. Obviously, on the other side, I could just go spin up validators myself for maybe. That's just something I don't want to explore.
00:19:32.766 - 00:19:32.994, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:33.032 - 00:19:43.350, Speaker A: And I mean, we run a few validators in terms of like, it's easier to trade this for someone that maybe isn't as infrastructure focused or wants to have a little bit more granularity in terms of something.
00:19:43.420 - 00:19:43.894, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:44.012 - 00:20:12.602, Speaker A: And I think the granularity point becomes a lot more apparent in the bitcoin side of things. So if we're thinking about block producers, like block producers in the bitcoin network, right? Miners, a minor setup is insane. They have to get these special data centers. They get all these tons and tons and tons of miners that are getting shipped over from China. And the shipment times are very variable and unpredictable. They could be like between six months and twelve months. They have to pay for all this electricity.
00:20:12.602 - 00:21:02.686, Speaker A: Energy prices are all over the place these days. And they just have to manage this just massive, massive fleet. They have to have data center technicians and operators and all this stuff, right, compared to just throwing an ETH validator in the cloud and putting some collateral on it. So they actually have a very significant amount of operating expenses and overhead for these. So if I were to say, into having next year, post having next year or something, I wanted exposure to miners and hash rate, because I feel like a lot of the network is going to drop off after having giving, it's going to be unprofitable for those miners, right? And I kind of want to fill that gap and take some of the subsidies, right? If I want to do that, I should have already had orders in for new miners. It just takes such a long time to fully build out a mining operation. And who knows, maybe by the time having happens, my view changes.
00:21:02.686 - 00:22:12.360, Speaker A: So these derivatives on top of the bitcoin blockspace market, right, where I can just trade, I think it's slowly becoming standardized, is called like hash price, which is a combination of transaction fees, hash rate difficulty, bitcoin price, and the block subsidy, right? I would much prefer to trade that than go set up a whole mining thing for a year and then tear it down the next year and set it back up on the bitcoin side, which can also be done through alchemia, but we're also doing it through a mining pool called Buxor, who offers these derivatives as forwards. We can express acute granularity for when we want. So they have bullet contracts, which are essentially just a nice way of saying they're monthly contracts on specific months. So if I wanted to, I could pick, like I want to short hash rate, hash price in the month of September, and then I'm going to long it in the month of November. You can pick very specific dates and very specific months with them, which is just kind of this, in my opinion, on the minor side level of control that they haven't really seen before. And on someone that wants exposure to mining, something that's a lot easier for me to grok and use.
00:22:13.610 - 00:22:42.206, Speaker B: How would it work though? Let's say on e, when it's super active, they got the bull market. Everybody's doing trading or mev bots making bank. The fees are crazy during some of these times. Let's say you want us to get this block space, right and then trade it as a derivative or whatnot. What would the kind of market go kind of do, though? Can you short and long, this kind of derivative? Or is it you're just buying it and that's it?
00:22:42.308 - 00:22:42.574, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:42.612 - 00:22:47.806, Speaker A: So this is kind of interesting. And this kind of gets down to how the specific instrument is constructed.
00:22:47.918 - 00:22:48.434, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:48.552 - 00:23:11.990, Speaker A: So on something like okemia, they are what would be called physically settled and over collateralized. So that means as a seller of ETH revenue, I'm going to need to post some external ETH or external USDC or something like that, just to make sure that I'm not contractually obligated. But I'm obligated by the collateral I posted to pay my buyer.
00:23:12.070 - 00:23:12.410, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:12.480 - 00:23:15.066, Speaker A: Just to make sure you follow through with the agreement and don't reneg on it.
00:23:15.088 - 00:23:15.466, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:15.568 - 00:23:28.126, Speaker A: And you can buy and sell that, and it's a swap. So you buy and sell when you desire. Given there's a market for it, there's not necessarily. Each contract does have time on it.
00:23:28.148 - 00:23:28.286, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:28.308 - 00:23:56.390, Speaker A: So I might purchase a month contract where I would receive a month of a validator's revenue, but there's not really a reason why I can't sell that. I can't buy that month of revenue from a validator and then sell it to you in the month. Right. On the forward side, it's kind of the same thing. I might buy a month contract and at the end of that month the contract would expire and be settled out. But if there's a buyer or seller or whatever within that month, I can also sell it to them.
00:23:56.460 - 00:24:03.354, Speaker B: I guess you could also do bidding on this as well. If someone wanted to buy it from you, you could have like an auction for it or something like that.
00:24:03.472 - 00:24:23.950, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It is interesting when you compare it, though, to trading just like a normal digital asset, like bitcoin perps or whatever. Because bitcoin perps move very fast, right. People are constantly trading them. It's like a very quick market or even some altcoin on unisoft or whatever. And these are a lot slower moving.
00:24:24.020 - 00:24:24.302, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:24.356 - 00:24:36.130, Speaker A: Bitcoin's difficulty addressed every two weeks. Maybe you update review, like every two weeks or every few months or whatever. On the Ethereum side, again, it's more measured in days and weeks than it is in seconds and milliseconds.
00:24:36.870 - 00:25:12.670, Speaker B: I think one kind of pitfall from this is if you're a massive MeV team, right, or you're doing some kind of trading, not even Mev, but just trading in general, and you want to buy, let's theoretically say you buy at like 50% of the validators. Actually, no, it's unrealistic. But maybe 10% of the validators and you get 10% of the revenue you're putting in and maybe they just swarm like that kind of block or that range or that time period and get all their fees back that they paid. It's kind of like cornering the market in some sense.
00:25:12.820 - 00:25:52.618, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess there's definitely these interesting scenarios or possibilities to think about where people can utilize these gas or block space derivatives for significant profit or advantages in other markets, right? I guess maybe one of the easier ones to think about would be like Circle and USDC. When people kind of come to circle and they mint or redeem USDC, they just charge a flat fee for that USDC event. But obviously they're doing it on chain, on Ethereum main net and fees are definitely not static, right. So they're extremely variable and can spike really high.
00:25:52.704 - 00:25:53.050, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:53.120 - 00:26:34.278, Speaker A: So that actually becomes like a pretty big burden for a circle in times of super low fees. Maybe they're making a nice spread on that, but maybe they're paying $100 to redeem a few hundred thousand dollars of USDC or something like that, 20 times in a day or whatever. Basically, if there's a ton of redemptions or a ton of mints in the day and they're only charging like 20 basis points or something, or two basis points, whatever they charge. And the gas fees are just like hundreds and thousands of dollars, that's kind of crazy for them, right? So in turn, what they can do is given a lot of those fees kind of flow to validators, is they could go and purchase validators income to hopefully offset that variability in the fees that they have to pay for the minting and redeeming.
00:26:34.374 - 00:26:59.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess at that point, if the validator is making a fair amount, you would have to do this trade off of why would I want to buy this? If I can pay for it, then if the validator is making a fair amount of fees, then you're going to have to pay a lot for it and then it's got to be a trade off. Can I even make money during this time of, I guess, this period, I guess outpriced what I paid for it.
00:27:00.230 - 00:27:29.242, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think that it's kind of this interesting thing where right now the overall block space markets are pretty nascent, and people haven't really started to standardize or come to terms with what makes for a good expiration for a contract or standard one. Some people are doing weeks, some people are doing months. I don't know, in Circle's case, think about, I don't know if they purchased a six to twelve month contract or something like that. There's no way of forecasting how much fees might cost ten months from now.
00:27:29.296 - 00:27:29.706, Speaker C: Really.
00:27:29.808 - 00:27:38.366, Speaker A: So in that case, they might have actually purchased a validator's revenue very cheaply, relative to how much it might earn within the course of that year, I guess.
00:27:38.388 - 00:27:41.040, Speaker B: What if the person just shuts down their validator anyway?
00:27:42.690 - 00:28:32.106, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a very contentious topic. In spots where given like blocks, this market is physically settled, right? Like where the EtH that a validator is earning or the bitcoin that a miner is mining, is actually physically delivered to the buyer of the contract. There is this concept of what if the validator goes offline? What if it gets slashed, what if it's slashed on purpose by the seller? What if the miner goes offline, or the data center the miner is in is harmed or whatever, right? And often this kind of comes down to the given protocol or the company that is offering or helping you broker these deals with the seller, where they might also require the seller to post some additional collateral or additional margin that can be used to offset potential downtime of the block producer.
00:28:32.138 - 00:28:32.490, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:32.580 - 00:29:06.442, Speaker A: Common things are on markets that aren't on chain, like somewhere between 30 and 60% collateral. Additionally, depending on your working relationship with the firm, and just like additional vetting of your firm and stuff on chain, right now, Okima is over collateralized, right? Just like how we would see an ave or a compound market being just given to. There's not really a legal contract. But, but yeah, I mean, I totally agree with interesting, it's definitely an interesting consideration and a risk as like a trader of it.
00:29:06.496 - 00:29:25.840, Speaker B: It wouldn't be really decentralized. It'll be centralized in a way where you would have to do this kind of trade of a contract for block space. It wouldn't be fully decentralized. I can't imagine that happening unless there was some way of implementing that into the node and then having this market within the node itself.
00:29:27.490 - 00:29:39.410, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you right now in Alchemia, you just have to kind of understand that each day a validator is going to come and deposit their revenue, or every few days they'll deposit their actual revenue.
00:29:39.490 - 00:29:39.734, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:39.772 - 00:30:03.478, Speaker A: But I can see someone launching, I don't know, like a wrapper on top of ochemia where it's, know, you point your validator's address where rewards are going to accrue to this smart contract that integrated with Okemia's vaults to where the revenue you earn kind of immediately just sits in those vaults and then is distributed wherever you have contracts placed.
00:30:03.574 - 00:30:03.882, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:03.936 - 00:30:41.194, Speaker A: Like, I could see something like that happening. Something else that also becomes kind of interesting too, is, and this is a little bit more, not necessarily like what exists in the market now, but a little bit forward looking. I don't really know how much of a demand there would be for this or how many people might actually want this, but it kind of comes down to actual physical validator swaps. Like, say you and I both operate a validator, right? And you operate a validator and I have some cash and I say I want to pay you for your validator and I give you the cash, you give me a validator. But how to do that? That's happened, right? Manifold or whatever, acquired all those cream validators a little bit ago.
00:30:41.312 - 00:30:41.786, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:41.888 - 00:30:44.986, Speaker A: But how does that happen in a decentralized or trustless way or whatever?
00:30:45.088 - 00:30:45.594, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:45.712 - 00:31:19.878, Speaker A: I think the solution to that is DBT. I could operate a validator with three or four separate parties. I might have coinbase and block Damon, whatever figment as the operators or the shared keyholders of my validator and then some type of smart contract, multisig, smart account kind of thing where I can enter into a contract with you and you can take over the control of my validator. Right. I don't know, that's just something that's been interesting to me, too, especially with a validator queue and wanting to completely hop it.
00:31:19.964 - 00:31:21.494, Speaker C: Right. Yeah.
00:31:21.532 - 00:31:41.678, Speaker B: I think redirecting the revenue stream and having a mapping towards that in some way would be useful. Just trying to think. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a fun experiment. I think that's the whole point of thinking of this, is it could be like a massive thing, but it's just keep on experimenting until you hit something that works, I guess.
00:31:41.844 - 00:31:56.482, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I think that's the reason I started adjacent. I actually just fundamentally interested in how people design these things and how they're going to start interacting with each other or working with each other or how to trade against them.
00:31:56.536 - 00:31:57.042, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:57.176 - 00:32:05.442, Speaker A: And kind of stumbled into just. It also makes sense to operate some infrastructure for these protocols, and they can also be traded pretty good as well.
00:32:05.576 - 00:32:14.658, Speaker B: So are you doing any other trading on just like normal derivatives as well? I think, yeah, any kind of normal derivatives, like on chain derivatives, et cetera?
00:32:14.754 - 00:32:15.062, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:15.116 - 00:32:41.470, Speaker A: Some interesting things are like, when I started getting into this, I'd never traded any tradfi derivatives before, which is interesting. I feel like a lot of people I meet in the space that have done this, have done that, and that's how they got into it. We've kind of started thinking about that a little bit and tinkering with those more so just to understand what a really well functioning market looks like. I don't really have anything to really provide to the oil market or whatever.
00:32:41.540 - 00:32:41.870, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:41.940 - 00:33:09.334, Speaker A: It's not my niche, but those are long standing and well functioning markets. And then on the defi and the crypto side, I try and use just about every protocol, like per protocol or other derivative protocol that might come out right. And I have a few that are my go to for sure, but I don't necessarily. Outside of finding kind of just these interesting trades across, like the squeath trade, I'm not really running like a long short fund.
00:33:09.532 - 00:33:11.786, Speaker B: Is that like a goal you want to get to?
00:33:11.968 - 00:33:21.142, Speaker A: I don't know. I mean, I think so. Maybe eventually one day. Right now we're a lot more heavy research focused rather than fully profit driven.
00:33:21.206 - 00:33:21.770, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:21.920 - 00:33:32.138, Speaker A: And I think that one day it could be kind of interesting to think about, well, what does it look like to raise a fund and specialize in kind of these niche markets.
00:33:32.234 - 00:33:32.880, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:35.330 - 00:33:39.966, Speaker A: It can, but I don't know how I feel about doing a normal or traditional raise.
00:33:40.078 - 00:33:40.690, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:40.840 - 00:33:45.022, Speaker A: Especially when a lot of the protocols that, it just doesn't feel defi native.
00:33:45.086 - 00:33:45.266, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:45.288 - 00:33:48.450, Speaker A: And a lot of the protocols that we use obviously are very defi native.
00:33:48.530 - 00:33:48.966, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:49.068 - 00:34:32.898, Speaker A: So I've tinkered around before with thinking through what it would look like to start something via enzyme, their previous melon protocol, where it's just kind of this fund. Anyone can kind of launch a fund and they have some nice guardrails and stuff for investors, and anyone openly invests in something and I'll just manage it. I've definitely tinkered and thought about stuff like that before, and honestly, that will probably be the route over the next year or so that we kind of take as we kind of look to take adjacent to the next step. I guess outside of just talking with people and putting out some research and awesome lists and doing some manual or just launching just differentiated tooling that isn't per se profit driven, I guess.
00:34:32.984 - 00:34:33.620, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:34.630 - 00:34:41.586, Speaker B: And how did you really start your team as well? Was it just kind of like a group of friends came together or did you have to go headhunting?
00:34:41.698 - 00:35:08.650, Speaker A: No headhunting. And we're small, just like a few people. I'm actually, I guess, the only full time employee, the only one actually doing all of it. And I was actually just talking to someone about this other day. What I found made a lot of sense was obviously I have a lot of passion across all of these markets, but some people don't or have specific interest and really into options, really into block space, really into just infrastructure.
00:35:08.730 - 00:35:09.118, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:09.204 - 00:35:16.818, Speaker A: So I just knew some people and friends in each spot and they just kind of helped me with various things along the way on each one of those.
00:35:16.904 - 00:35:29.430, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. I think it's good to get the people that specialize and have them do the specialized tasks rather than having jack of all trades. It's very hard to find the people. Jack trades, actually insanely difficult.
00:35:29.580 - 00:35:31.078, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:35:31.244 - 00:35:47.340, Speaker B: Split up tasks into little modules and then find the people perfect for those little modules. And kind of it all builds this big, I guess, platform or program or the grand vision eventually. It's kind of something I last few months actually.
00:35:48.190 - 00:36:00.110, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. And the way I see it too is a lot of adjacent interest areas or things that I might go after. Just give it. We're not building one specific product.
00:36:00.180 - 00:36:00.366, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:00.388 - 00:36:20.902, Speaker A: Like we're involved in a lot of things. And I've kind of realized that those interests float with my interests. Right. As I start to get interest. Recently I've started really getting interested in prediction markets, right. So as my interests kind of shift somewhere, if I had another team member, there's no saying his or hers are going to go that way as well.
00:36:20.956 - 00:36:21.318, Speaker C: Right?
00:36:21.404 - 00:36:33.274, Speaker A: So rather maybe as I start floating and being interested in prediction markets and I get a little bit closer in the communities there, someone would want to come on or help me in some capacity on the prediction market side.
00:36:33.472 - 00:36:37.610, Speaker B: And this would be like running a prediction market for example. Just like interacting with them.
00:36:37.760 - 00:36:58.802, Speaker A: Interacting with them. We can't get into them. I guess they're interesting. Where polymarket is kind of like a big one. Then you have some of the centralized ones predicted and whatever. But all the prediction markets, there's things I'd look at, right? Which do they use? Actual cash or crypto? Like actual money.
00:36:58.936 - 00:36:59.618, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:59.784 - 00:37:19.046, Speaker A: And are the markets created by the team or can anybody create a market? And how do the markets get resolved? Like polymarket resolves Uma Oracle. But something like manifold, which doesn't have actual cash and markets are permissionless, is just self resolved by the person that created the market.
00:37:19.148 - 00:37:19.570, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:19.660 - 00:37:31.566, Speaker A: And so obviously if there's not actual cash, there's nothing for me to gain really outside of research and understanding that market for when somebody does launch one with similar aspects with cash.
00:37:31.668 - 00:37:32.270, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:32.420 - 00:37:43.374, Speaker A: But I find them like a very interesting category because they are truly out there on the most niche market you can get because you can just trade like any.
00:37:43.572 - 00:37:46.750, Speaker B: So yeah, if there's no money in it, then what's the point of interacting with them?
00:37:46.820 - 00:37:47.054, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:47.092 - 00:38:42.670, Speaker A: For example, polymarket is actual money, right? And there's like a few on Solana that have started slowly launching that are actual money as well. Tough bar is just not really many traders on those given they're so new relative to polymarket. Something like, for example, on manifold they are no money, but anyone can create a market. So when you look at something like polymarket, there's maybe only like 50 or like 100 markets or something like that. But when you look at Manifold, there's like legit like 30,000 markets, right. Anyone can create it, right? And so it could be kind of interesting to, even if it's just like fake money or whatever, trade across them and kind of see, and just see how people might create a market or how they might interact with the market, right? And the other interesting too is just about all of those markets that I kind of listed besides predict it and stuff. But like polymarket and manifold and Solana ones, their underlying exchange is all based off of some type of amm.
00:38:42.750 - 00:38:46.066, Speaker B: Okay, so like uniswap or sushi swap for example.
00:38:46.248 - 00:38:59.142, Speaker A: Yeah, most of them are v two styled. I think like polymarket and Manifold have started experimenting with a v three. But yeah, most of them are v two styled with some additional component of an off chain order book to complement it.
00:38:59.196 - 00:39:04.918, Speaker B: I guess the automation, the stuff would be quite interesting as well. Do you do automation at all for it or is it all just kind of manual?
00:39:05.014 - 00:39:17.198, Speaker A: When we start, it'll just be kind of manual. But for example, we're running automated stuff on polymarket and manifold, even though again, manifold isn't actual cash. But it's interesting to see the scale of the markets and you kind of.
00:39:17.204 - 00:39:19.422, Speaker B: Prepare for the real ones when they do come out.
00:39:19.476 - 00:39:42.806, Speaker A: I'm pretty confident in the next probably, let's say like two years, we'll have an actual cash kind of open listing prediction market that has some type of really good resolution solution. I think that's the primary criticism of polymarket right now, obviously, Manifold's self resolving. Doesn't really solve anything when you introduce actual cash, because people can just game it.
00:39:42.908 - 00:39:45.270, Speaker B: Yeah, it's such a small tool or something.
00:39:45.420 - 00:40:12.382, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in the next few years we will really have something like that. And I think it'd be pretty powerful, more on the centralized side. Again, it's not in defi, but we've also been trading a little bit on Koshi, which is fully CFTC regulated, and they moved away from the prediction market, like branding, and they just call it, you can trade events, which I guess helps them with their regulation. And they let you trade stuff like every day. You can bet on the weather in New York City, what's the temperature going to be?
00:40:12.436 - 00:40:13.280, Speaker B: Oh, what?
00:40:14.050 - 00:40:33.558, Speaker A: You can also do stuff, know, betting on the fed rate hike or something like that. Yeah, it's definitely fun. There's also kind of crazy ones out there where they make you think a little bit like, hey, should we be listing that kind of market where it's like, what's the probability that in the year 2023, like a hurricane hits Florida or something like that?
00:40:33.644 - 00:40:40.842, Speaker B: Right. Okay. That would be like a very long prediction, though. You would have to wait until that time.
00:40:40.976 - 00:40:48.662, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. They're definitely like longer term, they can be longer term contracts or they could be super short daily weather.
00:40:48.726 - 00:40:49.194, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:49.312 - 00:41:00.030, Speaker A: But to me it's just really interesting to actually move more away from, I don't know, just like asset prices to what would be the price you would associate with a given event at a given time.
00:41:00.100 - 00:41:12.174, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like, okay, people gambling on probability. Well, I guess that's all gambling, really. Yeah, it's interesting. And I guess, how do you manage your time as well if you're working full time and also doing adjacent.
00:41:12.302 - 00:41:14.930, Speaker A: Yeah, so like full time work.
00:41:15.000 - 00:41:15.330, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:15.400 - 00:41:24.834, Speaker A: I kind of do infrastructure devopsy, some programming stuff. Yeah. It relates to what we're doing in terms of infrastructure.
00:41:24.882 - 00:41:25.046, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:25.068 - 00:42:12.406, Speaker A: So that makes it super quick and easy to kind of build proof of concepts, add additional marketing or not marketing, monitoring, pull in data from new markets and kind of just observe these markets and stuff, as well as alerts and all that. That's super helpful there. So a majority of my time kind of outside after work, or I try and spend some, a little bit when I wake up and then post dinner on understanding new markets, like reading papers, like reading docs, collecting and thinking about, collecting information, writing and thinking about these new markets or where a trade might be right to where maybe the weekends are the time where I can either do some of the manual trading or initially do the manual trading and kind of start to automate it.
00:42:12.428 - 00:42:12.758, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:12.844 - 00:42:24.938, Speaker B: I think to automate anything, you've got to be good at doing it manually. And then once you understand manual approach in quite some depth, you can develop like an algorithm to do it for you and you know intuitively what the heuristics are.
00:42:25.024 - 00:42:25.274, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:25.312 - 00:42:26.522, Speaker A: Or what you should be looking for.
00:42:26.576 - 00:42:36.990, Speaker B: Or how it should common patterns and what to expect when something happens. Yeah. It's like the best way to think, I think, to do that.
00:42:37.060 - 00:43:09.570, Speaker A: I think right in the beginning of our conversation where we discussed of how do you kind of just dive into this and get into all of this. With regards to my time management now, putting in all of that work on the front end, focused on building out a base layer and having really good means for information consumption of new stuff, of what's going on and all the trends and everything really set me up to manage my time really well. Right, because you could spend your entire day just reading new news and new consumption.
00:43:09.650 - 00:43:09.990, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:10.060 - 00:43:19.370, Speaker A: But having a feed that maybe only takes you like half an hour a day or 20 minutes a day or something like that is like seven out of ten super high quality or something like that really helps you there.
00:43:19.440 - 00:43:48.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I think even with whatever small amount of time you have, it's also very important to get into a focused state because you can accomplish so much in such a small amount of time if you're really intensely focused. For example, today I just woke up and instantly grabbed my laptop, started coding for like 4 hours. Didn't even realize I haven't even started my day. I just woke up instantly, started coding and then 4 hours went by. I was like, oh wait, should we eat or something?
00:43:49.530 - 00:43:50.806, Speaker A: You just got to lock in.
00:43:50.908 - 00:44:46.146, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And I think doing that as early as possible in a day as well is important because then you're like compounding small little wins where it motivates you more. The later you go down in the day to do even better, I guess habit stuff, like make better decisions rather than if you wake up and, I don't know, do something not really good, then it's like a loss, a very small one, but it does compound later through the day and you have to fight back with the winds, et cetera. Yeah, I only just really noticed that, for example, if you don't make your bed and your environment is very messy, then I guess that goes into your mind as well. Maybe you don't necessarily think about it, but it's underlying in a way. Yeah, no, that's just kind of my observation with that stuff as well. But yeah, we have hit an hour and this has been quite interesting for derivatives.
00:44:46.146 - 00:45:01.790, Speaker B: The world I've never really explored. It's interesting to see how it all plays out, especially if it goes like fully decentralized derivatives and options, et cetera. Yeah, it's going to be quite an interesting field. Especially imagine ZK as well with derivatives, et cetera, and like cross chain.
00:45:04.050 - 00:45:12.794, Speaker A: Yeah, there's some interesting projects. Oh, renegade. And they're utilizing zks to kind of build dark pools for trading.
00:45:12.842 - 00:45:13.342, Speaker C: Right.
00:45:13.476 - 00:45:24.114, Speaker A: And I think stuff like that's pretty interesting. And I think a lot of people are trying to add in some base layer of privacy to a lot of this stuff, which is fun to watch as well.
00:45:24.232 - 00:45:52.154, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be quite interesting. There's so much innovation happening now as well. I mean, it's always been happening, but I think I'm quite biased in my field as well. Whatever field you're in, you kind of see what's out there already and what's possible. And then personally I get excited to see whether someone beats me to it or someone does something I didn't even think of, but maybe thought about a little bit in some way and they just made it the bigger system. Hey man, thank you so much for coming on. I appreciate your time finally getting to speak and great to connect finally.
00:45:52.154 - 00:45:56.398, Speaker B: This is kind of a common theme of me finally talking to people for the first time.
00:45:56.484 - 00:46:02.190, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I really appreciate you reaching out and coming on here. I've been listening to the podcast every week, so looking forward to finally being on.
00:46:02.260 - 00:46:14.410, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. And if anyone wants to come on or wants to suggest someone to come on, just dm me at scraping bits on Twitter and I'll get back to you. Otherwise, thank you so much, Nate, for coming on, and I'll see you in the next episode.
