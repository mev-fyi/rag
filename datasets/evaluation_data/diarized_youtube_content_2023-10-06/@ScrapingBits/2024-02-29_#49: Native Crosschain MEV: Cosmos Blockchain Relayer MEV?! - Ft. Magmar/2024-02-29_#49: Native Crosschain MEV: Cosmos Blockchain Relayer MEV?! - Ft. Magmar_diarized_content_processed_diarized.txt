00:00:00.250 - 00:00:19.950, Speaker A: The reality of how IBC works is if you transfer your tokens to the wrong chain, it basically changes the denomination of that token. It's extremely complicated for users to figure out, so if you find a price differential, you can use the API to quickly execute that arbitrage and not have to figure out all the routing stuff and also not have to pay the gas fees.

Coming soon to Mantis app that's M-A-N-T-I-S-A-P gm gm everyone, my name's Togachi, the host of scraping bits today with magma from Skip. How's it going?
00:00:52.224 - 00:00:53.370, Speaker A: Good, man. How are you?
00:00:53.440 - 00:00:57.694, Speaker B: Pretty good. Apart from the bank holding all my money, it's decent know.
00:00:57.732 - 00:00:58.638, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that.
00:00:58.724 - 00:01:01.050, Speaker B: Gotta be a highlight. That's why we're in crypto.
00:01:01.130 - 00:01:01.726, Speaker A: That's right, yeah.
00:01:01.748 - 00:01:06.078, Speaker B: It's a pleasure having you on. And for the people that aren't familiar with you, who are you and what do you do?
00:01:06.164 - 00:01:43.042, Speaker A: Sure thing. I'm one of the co founders of Skip. Skip money for the website and we build a ton of infrastructure services across interchange. So basically like roll up stack on Celestia and then also Cosmos chains. We started as an Mev company and we still do do a lot of cross chain Mev things and build a lot of products there. We started out building the first mev client on top of Tenermint, called Mev Tenermint, which receives similar adoption to Mevgeth but in Cosmos. And then since then we've built the block SDK, which is basically a programmable sequencing layer that allows you to split up your blocks into different lanes, each with their own inclusion and verification rules.
00:01:43.042 - 00:01:54.858, Speaker A: And more recently we've pivoted to building more foundational infrastructure stuff. So we build this skip API, which powers a lot of IBC volume inside of Cosmos, and then we build a on chain oracle.
00:01:54.954 - 00:01:58.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. Composable uses IBC as well, if you heard of.
00:01:58.232 - 00:01:59.102, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:01:59.166 - 00:02:09.138, Speaker B: Yeah, they're quite interesting doing cross chain stuff as well. You say the cross chain stuff in the MeV world. So what did that look like specifically? Were you doing cross chain strategies or infrastructure?
00:02:09.234 - 00:02:25.178, Speaker A: We never participated in the actual strategies ourselves, even though we hired a lot of different MEV searchers. So maybe a spoiler for an upcoming episode, but we hired Phallox, who was a sort of famous Polygon mev searcher when he posted his earnings one month.
00:02:25.344 - 00:02:26.154, Speaker B: Oh, man.
00:02:26.272 - 00:03:01.350, Speaker A: Yeah, those are good days. Hopefully we get those days again. But, yeah, we never participated in that. But what we did see was a lot of cross chain arbitrage, especially in Cosmos, you have the same assets just IBC'd around to other chains. And whenever you IBC those assets, since it's like a permissionless on chain bridging protocol, you mint synthetic versions on the destination chain. So the prices between those need to stay the same across the different liquidity venues on the different chains. And so we saw a lot of people making full time jobs out of monitoring that and then keeping their funds in different places and then arbitraging them.
00:03:01.350 - 00:03:07.938, Speaker A: And then, of course, we saw the standard stuff like cyclical arbitrage and back running and things like that, that we wanted to help incentivize.
00:03:08.034 - 00:03:27.902, Speaker B: Very interesting. Yeah. I think even that node you created for Cosmos, it's very interesting if you're saying it's similar to Geef, but for Cosmos, and that was built from the ground up, right? From scratch, what was that kind of process like? Obviously, building a node from scratch is not a simple feat. So were you kind of referencing geef, or were you kind of doing it from literal scratch without reference of anything?
00:03:28.036 - 00:04:18.670, Speaker A: I mean, we looked at Mevgath and we noticed a couple things. So it was designed to sort of have full block building. So basically, you outsource the building of your block to an external party, and then you add in memple transactions as you see fit. We noticed a couple of things that we wanted to change. So the first thing that we wanted to change was we didn't want to do full block building because we didn't want to change the signing rules that nodes had to sign their block headers. So instead, what we did was we set up a system that we built on top of tendermint to basically have, like, a fast lane at the very top of the block, where right before you propose a block, you essentially request transactions, and then you would put those transactions at the top, and then those transactions were built by some kind of external centralized builder who basically obeyed bundling preferences from their searchers. And so those would be just like, inserted at the very top.
00:04:18.670 - 00:04:48.306, Speaker A: We actually built it at a four week Terra hackathon or like hacker house. And then two weeks into that, Terra collapsed, which was kind of like a crazy experience just to see. Literally the entire TfL team was there. And then the next day, they were all gone. I don't know where they went, but assumed back to wherever. It was just completely crazy. And then I think post that, we were sort of questioning, where is Cosmos going to go from here? Terra was just this huge star in the sky that just went out suddenly, and that was the beginning of our journey.
00:04:48.306 - 00:05:22.430, Speaker A: And that's how we discovered cosmosis and Juno and Evmos and Dydx coming and Noble and all these new exciting projects. And so we started to build confidence in cosmos as a whole. And I think now that confidence seems to be paying off in some way. But all the things that we imagined would become big issues in terms of cross chain mv have just become a lot larger since then. Now you're really seeing cross chain MV volume between the larger liquidity chains, Kujira, osmosis, DydX, Noble. And it was sort of like, what's left? And I think you're going to see more with barrachain coming online, et cetera.
00:05:22.590 - 00:05:33.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Cosmos is quite interesting because every kind of protocol is their quote unquote chain. So technically, it is all just multi chain if you're doing mev right between different protocols.
00:05:34.002 - 00:05:35.270, Speaker A: Yeah, technically. Exactly.
00:05:35.420 - 00:05:52.214, Speaker B: I wonder, what would it take to really build a cosmos mev bot if it's to perform some kind of cross chain, I guess you would say cross chain arbitrage. Really what we would imagine in ETH, like Avax, cross chain arbitrage. Or is it just the name of it? That's what really it is, but maybe it's not cross chain.
00:05:52.342 - 00:06:18.750, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's two ways that I would build it. So the first one is very standard. Right. So you hold some asset and you have basically inventory across two different chains that you expect to sort of have price differentials, and then you essentially just execute via some kind of coordinated system, a buy and a sell to take advantage of an arbitrage in two different chains. Right. So price of OSmo is lower on osmosis than it is on, let's say, neutron.
00:06:18.750 - 00:07:00.126, Speaker A: So you buy on osmosis and then you sell on neutron immediately because you have inventory on both chains. Usually that gets really hard to do because you need a lot of inventory. You also need it spread out over so many venues that the price to execute that strategy profitably becomes really high. I think a better cross chain arbitrage bot that nobody's built yet that, as far as we understand, that is just ripe for the taking is a relay back running bot or unfortunately, a relay sandwiching bot. So, basically, with an IBC, there's two sources of order flow for an IBC chain, right. There's the wallet flow, which is standard for every chain. But then there's also the IBC flow, right? And that IBC flow is coming in from all kinds of different chains in various forms.
00:07:00.126 - 00:07:25.180, Speaker A: It could be swap messages, it could be just a transfer of tokens, it could be a smart contract call, and you can, as a relayer, transmit those packets. But since you're the one as the relayer, that actually signs and creates the transaction on the destination, you have full access to adding your own messages before, after, or on either side. So you can create a sandwiching bot as long as you're fast, or a backgrounding bot, as long as you're fast.
00:07:25.790 - 00:07:51.886, Speaker B: That's really interesting. Like the IBC. Yeah. I was thinking, I don't know if I spoke with the composable team about this in the podcast, but if you have this bridging structure, so IBC, and it's coming from every single chain, and you're getting an influx of that, you can really devise your own transactions and order them in different ways, because you see the pending transactions coming from this bridge, right? It's like a mempool, but for bridges, you could definitely do something interesting there. Is it an intent protocol as well, or is that just composable?
00:07:51.998 - 00:08:18.060, Speaker A: I wouldn't call Cosmos an intent protocol. It's unclear what intents really are. It's just a messaging protocol. So you could transmit intent over it, I suppose. But the cool thing with IBC is if you're the relayer, you have access to creating the destination transaction, as I said. So you can add messages, and messages are autonomic, so you can create a riskless sandwiching or back running bot. All you have to do is be fast on picking up those messages, which is relatively simple to do.
00:08:18.430 - 00:08:26.462, Speaker B: How come you've never built something like this, even just back running, not necessarily sandwiching? Because if you say nobody's done it and it's there for the taking, how come you haven't done it?
00:08:26.516 - 00:08:50.118, Speaker A: I mean, I guess there's no way to prove that we haven't, right? We haven't. I promise you. I think the main reason we haven't done it is we generally try to be serious about being an MEV infrastructure company versus an MEV participant. And maybe unlike some other MEV companies, we don't have any presence in the mempool ourselves. But we know about all the strategies, and we oftentimes recommend them to other parties to start employing. And so that's what I'm doing right now.
00:08:50.204 - 00:09:19.566, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, I think a lot of people would be interested in that. But I think on top of that also just e, like any other EVM chain, people are really into the cross chain domain of how do I arbitrage this or back run something that's being bridged? But when you see somebody like multichain, it's not guaranteed. It's different times of when transactions will pop out. Sometimes the LP is just not full, so you have to wait a little bit, or even they just go to prison. Like Multichan. It is an interesting field.
00:09:19.566 - 00:09:29.902, Speaker B: Nobody's really cracked it yet. I think that's just because the infrastructure, or maybe people are doing it, it's just not as predominant as single chain sovereign Mev.
00:09:29.966 - 00:09:30.338, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:30.424 - 00:09:45.186, Speaker B: But I remember seeing tweets ages ago of saying, like, mev on Cosmos is very interesting because it is this basically mev playground of all these chains, instead of just protocols. So I wonder, have you seen anything interesting that people are doing mev wise on Cosmos?
00:09:45.298 - 00:10:18.590, Speaker A: I mean, I've met a couple full time cross chain arbors. They hold their assets, usually in atom, and then they ivc to the places where they see the price differentials appearing. They're usually extremely competitive with each other. They basically compete on relaying times to get their assets to different places. And they also compete on the amount of inventory they can hold. Because obviously, if you're on the chain already, then you're going to be faster than somebody who's trying to IPC over. But yeah, I think a lot of the cross chain stuff gets really tricky in cosmos and I assume also in ethereum land, because you don't have any kind of shared state machine.
00:10:18.590 - 00:10:35.878, Speaker A: Right. So you can't do anything that looks like an atomic transaction. So if you're doing something like an arbitrage, that becomes really risky. Right. Because you can have one leg of your arbitrage execute, and the other side just doesn't go through or gets a bad price or something. And then you're stuck with a trillion pepe, and you don't want that. Right.
00:10:35.878 - 00:11:13.122, Speaker A: So I think it gets really complicated sometimes when you're trying to do a cross chain strategy, you might get screwed on one leg because somebody's trying to execute a single chain strategy and they're willing to pay more. So you get this really interesting combinatorial auction dynamic where I'm willing to pay X for chain a and B, but then you're willing to pay Y for just chain a, and then another guy is willing to pay Z for just chain b. Right. So how do you reconcile all of those in some kind of auction. It gets really fun. It gets really complicated. And I think only now are we starting to see the volumes where answering that question actually makes economic sense.
00:11:13.122 - 00:11:35.654, Speaker A: But until at least for the past year, it hasn't really made sense to resolve whatever it was, $600,000 of mev per year. I think we're going to see that change a lot, though. And, I mean, just recently we've seen this. Right. Like, the price on finance of TL over the last three days has been around $6. The price on osmosis has been 656 76, 80. That's a huge arbitrage.
00:11:35.654 - 00:11:54.234, Speaker A: Right. And there's a lot of volume in those pools. There's a lot of liquidity. People were arbitraging it before that. We saw the price of Osmo on, what was it? I think it was coinbase, go to, like, 175. And then osmosis, it was pool has 200 million in liquidity on it. And then I think as soon as people noticed that, it got wrecked.
00:11:54.234 - 00:11:55.822, Speaker A: But that was a massive opportunity.
00:11:55.956 - 00:12:10.770, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. People don't really look at these alt chains as much because all the hype happens on Ethereum being the one that started it all. It's just kind of the consensus of this will always stick around. And so people don't really look at all the different ones, especially cosmos. It's a big difference because it's not EVM.
00:12:10.850 - 00:12:15.714, Speaker A: Well, there's some evms coming to cosmos, but, yeah, for the most part, it's like the Cosmos SDK.
00:12:15.842 - 00:12:37.182, Speaker B: Yeah, like Solana or. What was the other one that was in rust aptos. These aren't EVM chains, and there are tons of opportunities, but it's like, you've got to learn a new skill, technically, because it's not agnostic to the other. Like, let's say you learn solidity. It's not the same language. So you have to learn a new language, basically, and a whole new ecosystem and how the nodes work and consensus and all this other shit. It's a lot to learn.
00:12:37.182 - 00:12:40.334, Speaker B: So it's not simple. And so there's a lot of opportunity just chilling there.
00:12:40.452 - 00:13:03.174, Speaker A: Totally. I think the reality was there were some really good arbitrage teams that were working on Terra when it was in its heyday, and they had a lot of knowledge about tendermint, and we know them, and they're extremely good. They mostly disbanded after terra collapsed, but I think one or two stayed around. They're just cleaning up. Right. They're just, like, completely cleaning up right now. So I'd love to see them get some competition at some point.
00:13:03.174 - 00:13:37.346, Speaker A: So if you know any searcher friends or anybody who's listening to this podcast, please do check out cosmos. There's a lot of opportunity there that's not being taken advantage of. Also, I think the metrics by which these searchers compete on cosmos is very different than Ethereum, too, as far as I know. As far as I've seen, most of the searchers in Ethereum are competing on gas price, and they're trying to optimize down to the unit of gas how much their strategies take, whereas on cosmos, that's just not a concern. Right. We don't even have a variable gas fee market. We have a fixed gas fee price that's extremely low for most chains, even the most high volume ones.
00:13:37.346 - 00:13:44.786, Speaker A: And so the competition matrix shifts a lot more to speed and latency, which is just like a different ballgame for most people.
00:13:44.888 - 00:14:13.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like any chain that's not Ethereum is really just speed and latency, like Avax, phantom, you know, all those BSc, they have really short block confirmation times, so, like, normal high frequency trading in that realm, plus just crypto, whereas Ethereum is. You can just create a bundle and you're home free. Really? Yeah, pretty much risk free, basically, because you don't really see sandwiches happen on any alt EVM chains, do you? Unless there is, like some kind of flashbots equivalent, but if not, kind of hard to find.
00:14:13.844 - 00:14:43.110, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess if you look at, I think, like, us and Fastlane are probably the two flashbots for other ecosystems that exist. Fastlane doesn't allow for sandwiches at all. They only allow for back running. We've done the same historically. That wasn't because there was any kind of technical impossibility of doing that. It was actually more so because the chains themselves didn't want there to be sandwiching, so they wanted us to configure it so that it was only back running that was allowed. I think that's changing now.
00:14:43.110 - 00:15:15.358, Speaker A: I think a lot of people are a little bit, for some reason, more open to sandwiching, because I don't really know the reason, but people would like that. And of course, you can configure our software to remove those protections because it's open source and people can modify it however they want. But traditionally, in Cosmos, we've had a first come, first serve mempool for as long as you can remember. So there never really was that much sandwiching because it was almost impossible to front run anything. And so we wanted to keep that variant alive and changed it, too. So that's how we built our mev auction markets. I assume that will change, though.
00:15:15.444 - 00:15:36.390, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I'm always wondering, why didn't you just go down the full mev route? You had a background in Bridgewater, so surely that would have helped as well. So what's the reasoning behind not going down Mev and going into skip? Because you also did some interesting stuff with the NFT things as well. The first tweet sold that NFT. You guys did that at send co, right?
00:15:36.460 - 00:15:39.480, Speaker A: That's right, yeah. That was the previous company I helped start.
00:15:40.170 - 00:15:42.870, Speaker B: 2.8 million for a tweet. Pretty good meme.
00:15:42.950 - 00:16:02.894, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that was absurd. Just on a personal note, like at Bridgewater, I was dealing in a very zero sum market. The entire thinking was zero sum. So it was just very much like us versus them. Like us trying to get alpha, which inherently means somebody else is getting negative alpha, losing to the market or losing to beta. So I kind of got sick of that, to be honest.
00:16:02.894 - 00:16:25.074, Speaker A: I just thought it was kind of intellectually not exciting. And for me, like getting into Mev. Yes, it was very similar in some ways to the HFT stuff that I was doing before. But on the other hand, that's sort of why we've transitioned from that and become more an infrastructure business, because we're trying to not be zero sum. Right. We want to be positive sum. Our unofficial slogan is grow the pie, which is kind of a meat.
00:16:25.074 - 00:16:45.120, Speaker A: But this is something that we do believe in. We do want to push this ecosystem forward. I do believe in crypto. I've been in it forever, since I was a kid, and I'd like to see it succeed. And I think Mev is probably a result of it succeeding, and it's not a reason that it will succeed. I think over time we've started to think about the stuff that actually makes the big difference, at least on the infrastructure side.
00:16:45.570 - 00:16:50.430, Speaker B: And what happened to scent? Did you discontinue that or what happened to that?
00:16:50.500 - 00:17:07.460, Speaker A: Yeah. So I was an early co founder of Scent. It used to just be me and this guy, Max Brody, working out of his basement in San Francisco. I was super young at the time. I was like 17 or 18, I think I was a CTO and I didn't fucking know what I was doing. But all I knew is I was excited about crypto and ethereum because I'd been mining it.
00:17:07.830 - 00:17:08.402, Speaker B: Oh, nice.
00:17:08.456 - 00:17:49.102, Speaker A: In the beginning, it was a very different project. The reason was called sent was because we had this idea for a social media site. Where basically you post content and then instead of a, like you sort of micro donated a single cent. The idea was like all these people who have their content monetized by larger companies instead could monetize their content in very small ways, and 10,000 likes could add up to 10,000 cents instead, which is somewhat meaningful for some people. And then of course get into the millions or billions, it's obviously very meaningful. So that was the idea. And as I tried to implement that, I think I was working with stripe at the time, and I was like, this API is just not going to work for us, right? The charges they have on transactions are a minimum fifteen cents.
00:17:49.102 - 00:18:30.554, Speaker A: So obviously it's not going to happen. So the only alternative at the time, and I mean, obviously this is not true anymore, given gas fees, was Ethereum. So I went about and I bought, I don't know, a couple hundred thousand Ethereum for super cheap, like, I don't know, $20 or $10 or something like that, just to start the marketplace off. That's what really got us into crypto, and I rediscovered those holdings later, after I went to college, but after that I transitioned more and more into a more crypto native audience. And that's sort of where the NFT started to come along. And the opportunity sort of presented itself to go into tweets. And I had at that time left and gone to college and resigned from the company, but they sold the Jack Dorsey NFT.
00:18:30.554 - 00:18:33.658, Speaker A: I think since then they sort of scaled down the business substantially.
00:18:33.754 - 00:18:42.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Now that you've done sent and you've gone into skip, what do you think? Have you learned that's been most critical? Getting further than without?
00:18:42.872 - 00:19:20.126, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think two things I'd say. I was actually just talking to one of our engineers about this, but I do think startup environments favor a certain kind of person, and I don't think this kind of person is more valuable overall. And in fact, probably be really bad at a lot of things, and I'm extremely bad at a lot of things. But I think one thing that I do have that I've noticed about myself is really strong, just do it, like bias towards action, attitude, even without thinking about things. This causes a lot of problems for my girlfriend, but in a startup sense, I think it's been like an effective thing where after Bridgewater I was like, all right, fuck it. Just quit the job, start this. We didn't have funding yet, all those different things.
00:19:20.126 - 00:20:00.534, Speaker A: And I think that's benefited us, sort of going after opportunities, making hard decisions really quickly in a lot of different ways. My co founder Barry, who's way more intelligent than I am, is very similar. I think the other thing is really just sounds cliche, but hiring very good people, like, at this point, I feel like I have 1% to do with skip success. Most of it is the fact that we've kept an extremely high bar for engineering talent and creative talent, and those people are rock stars. And so my only job now is sort of act as like standard bearer for the culture, if I can, and making sure people can work together effectively. Because most of the creative effort and most of the output comes from not myself. I'm the guy now that does podcasts.
00:20:00.534 - 00:20:04.542, Speaker A: That's why I'm here. I'm no longer actually building the cool stuff that we're known for.
00:20:04.596 - 00:20:33.398, Speaker B: Okay, definitely interesting. The early days, you guys got to obviously have technical expertise, but as you scale and want to get stuff ramping up, you got to hire. And I definitely agree with having a high bar. You want to keep a standard for the environment, who they're around, because if you're hiring top tier talent, they want to be around other top tier talent, not really be dragged down by b developers or c developers. You want to just keep a team of a developers. I don't know if you heard this from Steve Jobs and Apple, but that's literally what they did as well during that time.
00:20:33.484 - 00:21:02.730, Speaker A: I think it just makes sense. You have to have a lot of trust at a startup, and people who are really high executing and have super high potential need to be around people that are similar so that they can have the trust to sort of reach their full potential themselves and give it their all, because I know everybody else is too. So, yeah, it definitely takes work to maintain that bar. We have a lot less people than we probably should have because of that, because it's been hard to find those people. But ultimately, I think it makes a huge difference in the terms of your company trajectory.
00:21:02.810 - 00:21:13.758, Speaker B: 100%. And when we talk about skip, what was the early days like and what is it really doing now? Is it kind of the same vision, or did you shift? What's that progress been like, that journey?
00:21:13.854 - 00:21:33.850, Speaker A: Yeah. So early days, it was just Barry and I. We couldn't hire anyone. Literally nobody would work for Skip, which was really tough. I think we went three, four months without hiring anyone. We talked to all these different engineers, and it just seemed like it was going to be impossible. So about like three weeks into know again to this bias for action, we were just like, fuck it, we're gonna build this thing.
00:21:33.850 - 00:22:26.998, Speaker A: I just sat down and I worked for God knows how long, but I sweated to essentially build out the first version of this MeV tendermint and then ship it to a bunch of validators. And so Barry and I were essentially doing everything after that. We made our first couple hires, and from there, it sort of snowballed. But I think in terms of company vision, things have shifted away from mev, which we sort of view as a second order problem, and more into what we consider to be first order problems, which are like general infrastructure that sort of, like, unlock different use cases that exist in the ecosystem. A thesis that we've had that's developed over time is like the Cosmos SDK is basically like a Perps SDK. It's actually surprisingly purpose build to build an incredibly good, fast perps protocol in a very decentralized way. And we've seen that happen with DyDX coming over, and now we're seeing the ten other purps protocols that are coming over or building from scratch.
00:22:26.998 - 00:23:06.978, Speaker A: And so we really wanted to make sure that we were building a tool that would help them. And in that case, it was really like an oracle. You can build an incredibly good oracle on top of some of the native features of the Cosmos SDK that's on chain and run by your own validator set and is extremely performant. And then we also wanted to start basically making the whole IBC experience easier to use for developers. So that's why we built this thing called the Skip API, which is essentially like a multi chain router that allows you to do any chain, any token to any chain, any token swaps in one click. And then that's been employed by a lot of the major front ends and order flow sources inside of cosmos. So that includes the Kepler swapping feature.
00:23:06.978 - 00:23:32.414, Speaker A: We're working with osmosis, we're working with stride, we're working with star yays. And so I think between the two, they seem pretty different. They actually play off nicely with each other because they're both foundational tools that chains usually really want. Once they get started, they need a source for onboarding liquidity, which is the API, and then they also oftentimes need some kind of external data to be piped in, which is what they use the oracle for. And so we've really indexed on these two products.
00:23:32.532 - 00:23:41.986, Speaker B: Man, when you talk about the multi chain router, that's just every chain in the cosmos ecosystem, right? Like each their own protocol? Or is this beyond Cosmos as well?
00:23:42.088 - 00:23:56.034, Speaker A: It's definitely all of Cosmos or anything that's IBC connected. But then we also have support for bridges now. So you can do one click swaps from any chain, any token on Cosmos into EVM, any chain, any token, and then also vice versa.
00:23:56.082 - 00:24:10.586, Speaker B: Is there some kind of generalized way you do this? Because if every chain is different, because they're all different protocols, how do you make them all work in some capacity of being able to route them all? Let's say there's a thousand different, quote unquote chains or protocols, but how do you route for all them?
00:24:10.688 - 00:24:50.198, Speaker A: Yeah, it's complicated. So I'll get into one example. Let's say you have USDC on Ethereum and you want to go to Osmo token on the Cosmos hub. The way that you would normally do that without the API is the first thing you would do is you might swap your USDC on Ethereum to native ETH token. Then you would take AxlR to transfer it over to Axelr, and then you'll end up with Axelweath on Axelr, and then you'll IBC transfer that Axelweath to osmosis, swap it for Osmo, and then you'll IBC transfer that Osmo to the hub. All of that is probably. I can't remember what I said, but basically six, seven transactions, right?
00:24:50.284 - 00:24:51.734, Speaker B: Different chains as well?
00:24:51.852 - 00:25:16.082, Speaker A: Yeah, different chains. And you also have to have gas fees on all those individual chains. You have to have some ethereum lying around on ETH, you have to have some Axel lying around on Axlr, and you have to have some Osmo lying around on osmosis. And since you're swapping into OSmO, you might not even have Osmo yet. Right. It's a huge pain in the ass. So how do you do it so that you only pay in ETh from Ethereum, and you do that entire flow in one click.
00:25:16.082 - 00:26:20.026, Speaker A: So in a single transaction, I mean, the way that you do that and the way the API does it is basically as soon as you do the axilar GMP bridging. Basically what it does is it triggers something called packet forward middleware that exists on axilar, which will automatically forward your IBC packet to osmosis. When it hits osmosis, that packet will trigger something called an IBC hook, which will call the smart contract on osmosis to make the swap. And then that will trigger PFM or packet forward middleware again to swap the final version of the Osmo out to the Cosmos hub. So basically it uses a bunch of different middlewares across every different chain to a route where you should go and execute the swaps along the way, but then b also do all of that in a sort of cascading way where you don't have to recreate new transactions. And when you use packet affordable middleware, you don't have to pay the native gas token of the chain you're passing through. So you don't have to hold any osmo and you don't have to hold any axlar.
00:26:20.026 - 00:26:25.666, Speaker A: All you have to hold is ethereum. So that's how you get from USDC on ETH to Osmo and the hubbin.
00:26:25.698 - 00:26:46.778, Speaker B: In a single transaction if it's doing swaps in every single chain, right? There's going to be some discrepancy in the pools to some degree when you think about uniswap and sushiswap, the two different pools for the same asset class. So if you're swapping between these pools, there must be another protocol as well that you can do an arbitrage. So I wonder if there is a six chain arbitrage for all these pairs.
00:26:46.874 - 00:27:26.534, Speaker A: Totally. The skip API is a tool that is heavily employed by arbitragers because nobody wants to figure out how to route tokens from ethereum to some random chain on Cosmos or vice versa. It's just all very complicated. And the reality of how IBC works is if you transfer your tokens to the wrong chain, it basically changes the denomination of that token. If I have Adam on the hub and then I transfer it to osmosis versus if I have Adam on the hub and I transfer to Juno, those are two separate versions of atom. Every time you transfer, its path dependent. So basically you have to oftentimes unwind your transfers back to the source chain so that you can actually send to the place you want to go in the right denomination.
00:27:26.534 - 00:27:56.578, Speaker A: So basically it's extremely complicated for users to figure out. So if you find a price differential, let's say between wrapstaked ETH on neutron and wrapstaked ETH on Ethereum, you can use the API to quickly execute that arbitrage and not have to figure out all the routing stuff and also not have to pay the gas fees. So there's definitely like an opportunity for that. All this stuff still goes over relayers. So my point before about creating like a relayer mev bot still applies to this, but I just haven't seen anybody do it yet.
00:27:56.664 - 00:28:04.290, Speaker B: How would someone make that relayer MeV bot? Would they have to actually create a relayer or just the bot itself to kind of scan the relayers?
00:28:04.450 - 00:28:49.286, Speaker A: Yeah, it would be super simple. I think somebody could do it in a day. So, basically, what you would do is you would fork either the Hermes or the IBC Go relayer. One's written in rust, one's written in go. These are, like, standard, off the shelf relayers that are employed in production by most relayer teams. And then all you need to do is basically, so the relayer will automatically scan for what they call packets on a source chain and detect if there's any packets that need to be IBC transferred over to a destination. But then once you see those packets, you just have to be really fast in transmitting it to the destination chain, and then you have to modify the transaction you create to relay that packet to essentially include additional messages that you can add so that you can do whatever strategy you want.
00:28:49.286 - 00:29:08.518, Speaker A: Right. Maybe it's a sandwich. Maybe it's a backrun. And since relayers deal with packets that are fully transparent, you can see what's in that packet. You can see if what you're transmitting is like a swap. Right. And so you just can execute your standard sandwiching or back running bot, just considering that information to construct the new messages.
00:29:08.518 - 00:29:14.926, Speaker A: And then you wrap those new messages into one transaction, and it's going to be atomic on the destination chain. I think it would be very simple.
00:29:15.028 - 00:29:26.458, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I wonder, do you think anybody's doing any non atomic strategies? Or have you seen any unique strategies on Cosmos? Kind of like war stories from exploring the chain?
00:29:26.554 - 00:30:18.482, Speaker A: Have I seen any unique strategies? I don't think I've seen anything too crazy, except for just, like, the massively higher amount of cross chain arbitrage, which I don't think exists on Ethereum as much, just given sort of, like, the nature and the layout of liquidity inside of cosmos. Yeah. I haven't seen anything too crazy, to be honest. I think probably the most interesting mev thing, and it's not to tutor on horn, but I do think it's kind of cool, is there was a ton of cyclical arbitrage on osmosis. I think there was, like, six to $10 million worth over the past year. Most of that came from the terracopse, when assets were extremely volatile. But basically, like, cyclical arbitrage is once you make a swap on one pool, there might be a route to take your tokens around a bunch of different other pools that haven't balanced out yet so that you can end up with more of the asset that you started with.
00:30:18.482 - 00:30:59.726, Speaker A: Right. So, like a big swap on a low liquidity pool will oftentimes trigger these. So we saw people minting, doing this strategy, and they were just spamming the mempool. So we built this thing called protoref, which is embedded and enshrined inside the osmosis chain, which essentially is an on chain cyclical backrunner. So after every single swap, as part of the execution of that swap, it will essentially simulate a bunch of different routes and figure out if there's a cyclical backrun that it can take to essentially make profit off of the trade that was just about to be executed. And then it will beat out any backrunners that are external that are trying to submit those transactions themselves. It will just completely obliterate them.
00:30:59.726 - 00:31:29.818, Speaker A: There's no way to defeat it. And the cool thing about it, too, is that it uses flash mint liquidity. So basically, because it's in protocol, it can just mint whatever token it wants, like USDC atom, osmo eth coin, and then it has to burn that minted liquidity at the end of it. But since it uses it for the arbitrage, it becomes a zero cost of capital strategy. And it's made osmosis, like 550 grand so far in dollar terms. So that's like a pretty cool thing that I think happened.
00:31:29.904 - 00:31:32.058, Speaker B: Flash minting seems pretty interesting.
00:31:32.144 - 00:31:36.390, Speaker A: Flash minting, yeah, flash loan, except it's native protocol.
00:31:36.550 - 00:31:44.720, Speaker B: I wonder if that can be done on Ethereum, like, with all these bridges and their synthetic assets. I feel like it could be a thing, right?
00:31:45.170 - 00:32:10.440, Speaker A: I mean, the ETH protocol itself can mint whatever the fuck it wants, right? It could mint a billion eth at one time if it wanted to. So it's kind of like, what if an MeV searcher could build their bot into geth itself and then use ethereum, the state engine, to actually mint it? Liquidity to execute these arbitrage bots. Right. That would be the equivalent, which would just be like an incredible strategy. Obviously, it's never going to happen.
00:32:11.210 - 00:32:20.470, Speaker B: Infinite e for one block, pay out, bribe it. Be cool, though. I think there's something there. I guess the equivalent would be like a flash loan.
00:32:21.370 - 00:32:39.070, Speaker A: Yeah, but flash loans, you have to borrow that money, and that's money that belongs to somebody else who have to pay a fee on it. In the case of flash minting, there's no fee, right? Because it doesn't cost anything to mint this. You're just literally minting it for a second, and then you're burning it all. It's not coming out of anybody's pocket. There's no capital utilization at all.
00:32:39.140 - 00:33:04.550, Speaker B: I guess that is the only closest thing, though, that could happen, unless you do like a flash swap, let's say flash swap with like ETH, but then yeah, that might happen, but again, it's just someone else's money. I don't think there's anything else that you could really do. Man. I really want to see some cool strategies. I know there's like some counter mev stuff on Ethereum where you can kind of create contracts to me bots.
00:33:04.970 - 00:33:07.218, Speaker A: I was wearing an article, Salmonella contract.
00:33:07.314 - 00:33:34.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I was writing an article on this stuff because it is quite interesting, but like Salmonella esque contracts, we basically abuse the algorithms of mev bots. And it is quite interesting because when you think of generalized frontrunners, if they fuck it up some way, if they have a specific heuristic, you could really take over or bait them. If you have capital, I think there is quite a lot of opportunity there that nobody even thinks of. It's like really out of the box thinking.
00:33:34.930 - 00:33:35.486, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:35.588 - 00:33:39.010, Speaker B: Not sure if people do that on cosmos, though. Just sounds.
00:33:39.080 - 00:33:55.778, Speaker A: I haven't seen many generalized. I mean, you can't build a generalized front runner just because we have FiFO mempools. But I don't know if I've seen generalized backrunners. I guess that doesn't really make sense as a concept. Right, because your goal is to get in front of somebody, not behind somebody, when you make something generalized.
00:33:55.874 - 00:34:21.726, Speaker B: Oh, you know, generalized back running kind of makes. You could definitely try it. I think it'll be harder because front running is actually incredibly easy. Like generalized front running, you just kind of scan, do they make profit? Can they replace my address? Do I make profit? Do they have any starting capital? All right, let's fund that. How do we fund it? Bold flash loan, or whatever else, create the route, et cetera. But back running is quite interesting, and I think way harder. Maybe not as profitable, but definitely still something that's worth doing.
00:34:21.726 - 00:34:57.158, Speaker B: How would you do that? You have a transaction, let's say, I guess you would scan if it's an address, like if it's swapping from one token to another. If it is, scan for every other relating contract in it. You would set up like a mapping in some way to do this. But if it's like a, say, specific protocol, then can I do anything to kind of capitalize on it? Like if that protocol has its own exchange rate internally, I guess you would check like storage logs, et cetera, accessed. That'd be interesting. I don't think I've ever seen that or even it does exist. We're just unaware.
00:34:57.158 - 00:34:59.126, Speaker B: But it is an interesting concept.
00:34:59.238 - 00:35:26.258, Speaker A: I think it's easier on a protocol like osmosis to do something like that. Just because osmosis is a chain. That is a Dex. Right. That's what their state is, is just like swap. So you know that the potential back running strategies are basically just like, how do you do cyclical arbitrage after a swap? So there's like a very small, I guess, like exploration space for your generalized backrunner to explore in terms of how you could make money.
00:35:26.344 - 00:35:26.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:26.632 - 00:35:36.358, Speaker A: Like state space or state space or just like opportunity space. Right. Like, you know that the only thing that you can do is, like, cyclical background. Just cyclical arbitrage. Yeah.
00:35:36.524 - 00:35:41.138, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah. Oh, man. Makes me want to get back to MeV.
00:35:41.314 - 00:35:42.914, Speaker A: Should come to Cosmos.
00:35:42.962 - 00:35:52.350, Speaker B: Come to Cosmos. Cosmos will sound interesting, but I don't want to learn a whole new thing, especially when I hear you trying to learn, like, AI. There's only so much you can really do.
00:35:52.420 - 00:35:53.038, Speaker A: That's true.
00:35:53.124 - 00:36:06.020, Speaker B: You got to focus in some ways. But what are your thoughts on AI and crypto in general? Maybe not specifically meV, but yeah, just thoughts in the cross intersection of those two.
00:36:09.350 - 00:36:23.974, Speaker A: Honestly, I don't really think about it. I sort of never got on the AI train. For better or for worse. Probably for worse. My co founder, Barry, was huge into it. He did some groundbreaking research while he was in college with. And I knew him in college.
00:36:23.974 - 00:36:45.950, Speaker A: He actually won, like, best paper award. I forget at what conference, but it was something large. It's actually how we met our first investor for skip, and I think Tarun got like 6th or something like that at that conference. He was big into it. I think he was focused not so much on transformer LLM stuff, but something else. I think more like reinforcement learning. He was like optimizing, like ebay auctions or something.
00:36:45.950 - 00:37:26.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the AI and crypto stuff that we've seen, I'm tempted to think a lot of it's just kind of like narrative pumping, more like narrative chasing for investment dollars. But I haven't really seen anything that's extremely interesting, except maybe perhaps outside or not, including these distribution engines for GPU compute. So I think Akash is kind of interesting. I think there's a couple, like, kudos and then there's a couple of others. I think mostly that's interesting to be because I used to be an Ethereum miner. I think I had, I don't know, like 130 90s Navidea, 30, sitting in a closet somewhere. That was like a lot of expensive hardware at the time.
00:37:26.762 - 00:38:03.462, Speaker A: And I imagine that happened to thousands of other people. And where do you put that next? Right. That's extremely viable. Compute. So my thinking was, well, if crypto can somehow adapt the same systems that they put all these gpus on to sort of mine ethereum, like hive OS or whatever, and they can just funnel that into AI training, then that would be a great way of just activating a bunch of these latent resources that crypto miners had, which feels like something that's potentially valuable or like a good arb in the market. But that's the main stuff that I've looked at so far. I assume you have many more thoughts on that.
00:38:03.516 - 00:38:42.260, Speaker B: And I think reinforcement learning is the way forward. I think that's the true way you can really. Well, if you think about, I guess, generalized artificial intelligence, I think the way we learn is from reinforcement learning and remembering from contexts and stuff like that. It makes sense to do reinforcement learning, but it's not as big as the other two, unsupervised and supervised, which makes sense if you have data, right, and you have to label it and kind of find what labeling is the biggest floor. So reinforcement learning kind of does. It finds it all for you. And blockchain is just all infinite data.
00:38:42.260 - 00:39:00.274, Speaker B: Well, not infinite, but it's all there. You're not starting from scratch, so you are at advantage. And I think there is a lot of opportunity for AI intersection in blockchain. And I think it is a pretty easy gateway into all realms of programming. Like HFT is not easy to get into, but you can do it in crypto. Just making a shitty mevbot.
00:39:00.322 - 00:39:02.170, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. That's literally what I did.
00:39:02.240 - 00:39:27.726, Speaker B: Yeah, startups are super easy as well because world capital was really easy to get. You can create like a contract to fundraise. Like my first project we fundraised was like half a million. Just creating a contract in a website and that was it. That's pretty unheard of. I guess you got to do like a Kickstarter or something, but then you have to get people to believe in you. And if you have no reputation, well, good luck.
00:39:27.726 - 00:40:01.862, Speaker B: Whereas crypto is just like Djens will throw money at you for anything, but then you have everything. It's literally every field in finance at least like infrastructure, quant business, AI, ZK, it's all the stuff. It's really terrific field actually. And also finances and manage teams. It kind of all comes to marketing and all that stuff as well. So it's a great gateway and relatively simple compared to traditional ways. But yeah, in terms of AI, I think there's a lot of work to be done for detection.
00:40:01.862 - 00:40:26.466, Speaker B: I know blocksec just released their AI detection tool recently. I'm not sure if it's AI, but I think it is. They save like 14 mil in six months, which isn't crazy. Wow. Prevented mil in hacks. Lucas from pen testify doing some pretty interesting stuff, like exploit generation, both AI to capture the search space, et cetera. And I think you could apply that to Mev and block building.
00:40:26.648 - 00:40:30.546, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say, when are we going to have AI powered mev bots?
00:40:30.658 - 00:40:53.850, Speaker B: 100%. But it is difficult because you have to have multiple domains of knowledge. You have to be able to create your own models. You can't really just Chat GPT it or do a wrapper around Chat GPT and call that a cutting edge technology. I think you need to specialize in anything. It'll be specialized. AI really takes over all fields in humanity.
00:40:53.850 - 00:40:59.594, Speaker B: If you can cater it to your specific problem, specialize it, then, yeah, it's definitely an edge over someone doing heuristics.
00:40:59.642 - 00:41:40.218, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess if you trained an AI algorithm on the most profitable mev accounts and looked at their bytecode and tried to read through what their contracts were doing and just replicated that thousands and thousands of time and just traded on all the block data on Ethereum, going back to Genesis and every other chain, I feel like you could probably come up with something that was pretty amazing, right? Or you could train it to build what you were saying before, which is salmonella type system, which just is built to find these contracts and then essentially deploy counter contracts to try to drain them out.
00:41:40.304 - 00:42:24.886, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a lot of things to kind of mess around with, but again, it's like the prerequisites to do it. It's just so difficult because you got to be good at AI, or at least decent of being able to create models in that whole field of training yourself, et cetera. Then you also have to have the knowledge of crypto and mev, which is very niche, I guess cyber as well, reverse engineering to be able to debug, make sure it's learning correctly and shit. It's not an easy task. But if you do, not at all. If you are able to combine them all, you're in a really good spot, because who else is doing it? If you're already doing one niche, combine it with another niche, and you have a new type of niche where there's little to no competition. So it is a good bet, I think, long term.
00:42:24.918 - 00:42:30.218, Speaker A: Well, the gotcha. You have cyber and you have AI and you got the Mevs. Why don't we just team up after this call?
00:42:30.304 - 00:42:50.958, Speaker B: Could definitely. Well, I'm not great at AI yet. I'm still learning. But I think definitely in the near future of 2024 is going to be a great year and it'll be really interesting to see in the halving as well. I think there's going to be a bull market 2024. I think it's going to be a crazy time next year, but obviously build on the bear and be prepared.
00:42:51.134 - 00:42:51.762, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:42:51.896 - 00:42:56.210, Speaker B: That's how you really capitalize on it all. That's where legends are made.
00:42:56.360 - 00:43:06.742, Speaker A: I mean, if we have a bull in 2024, this would have been a tiny bear market. It was shitty for alts especially. It would be very short. Right. I was expecting at least another two years.
00:43:06.876 - 00:43:30.718, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like if it is another two years, then, man, we're going to be so well prepared for it. It's going to be pretty funny. But the halving is coming up, so that's always a good time. After the halving, people prepare for it and then after it gets a bit bullish. Historically, I think some investment firms were telling me about that around six months after a halving is when it kind of picks up. So looking forward to that, really.
00:43:30.804 - 00:43:50.918, Speaker A: I mean, it's going to be combined with the fact that I think a lot of this current speculation is driven by this expectation that the bitcoin ETF will lead to just constant purchasing of bitcoin and that that will filter down to everything else as well. Sort of like, unclear if that's going to be the case, but I do think it's driving a lot of excitement right now.
00:43:51.004 - 00:44:19.982, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the way I make decisions is regret the things you did do instead of the things you didn't do. It's always been a good decision making philosophy, just like gut feelings, and at least you trust your gut and given enough chances, it will eventually work. Well, you'd hope your chances are good, but, man, I think this has been a very informational, eye opening chat, magma. I've been thoroughly enjoying it and I appreciate your time coming on and I hope to see everything come into fruition quite soon.
00:44:20.116 - 00:44:31.166, Speaker A: Same here. I will say, anybody listening to this know if you want to get deeper into Cosmos Mev and see what's going on. It's quite interesting. I don't think it'll be a waste of time, so definitely reach out if you're interested.
00:44:31.268 - 00:44:43.686, Speaker B: Perfect. Well, there you go. Any aspiring Mev giga chats want to make some money or lose some money, go to Megma. But man, thank you so much for jumping on. Really appreciate your time. And we'll definitely have you on again in the future. 100%.
