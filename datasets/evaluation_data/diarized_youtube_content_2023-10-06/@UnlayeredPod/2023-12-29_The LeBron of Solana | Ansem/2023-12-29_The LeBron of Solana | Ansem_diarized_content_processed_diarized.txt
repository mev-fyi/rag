00:00:12.650 - 00:00:24.838, Speaker A: Welcome to unlayered. I'm your host, Saul, joined by my co host Dave. And today we're here with the one and only Ansem, one of the bigger personalities on crypto Twitter. What's up, Z? How's it going?
00:00:24.964 - 00:00:26.902, Speaker B: Yo, what's good, guys? How are you guys doing today?
00:00:27.036 - 00:00:45.014, Speaker A: Doing well. Doing well. Getting towards the home stretch here of 2023. I think just right off the bat, I wonder, do you sleep, man? Like, you're online all the time, you're posting. I think your post per day is, like, insane, dude.
00:00:45.062 - 00:00:53.978, Speaker B: No, I've not been sleeping, bro. What happens to me during bull markets is like, you know, like the polyphasic.
00:00:54.074 - 00:00:57.406, Speaker A: Sleep, like uberman sleep and stuff.
00:00:57.428 - 00:01:27.954, Speaker B: Like, didn't even. I didn't know that was an actual thing that people did, but I realized I was doing it last cycle. I would sleep for 3 hours a night, be looking at shit, coins and shit all day, then take a nap during the day and then just get back to it. And somebody told me, I was like, nah, bro, the reason you're not tired is because you're sleeping in different cycles. Like, your body isn't already tuned to doing that, so it doesn't really affect you all that much for used to it. Wow. And honestly, when I was younger, I didn't sleep a ton, honestly.
00:01:27.954 - 00:01:45.920, Speaker B: Anyway, I've always been up more than the average person for some reason. But, dude, the markets, all this volatility is going on. There's new shitcoins launching every hour. So the more screen time you have, the more money you make, basically why I'm always up.
00:01:46.930 - 00:02:08.386, Speaker A: And what would you say at this point? You're such a connected person in crypto? Maybe it's a bit different now, but I guess historically or even today, what are your best sources of alpha? Is it literally on Twitter? Is it through private groups and telegram? Are you just finding stuff fundamentally, like, hey, this chart looks really good. Let me dig into it.
00:02:08.568 - 00:02:46.398, Speaker B: Yeah, last cycle, like the 2020, 2021 cycle, I didn't really have all that many groups that I was pulling Alpha from. Most of it was just like, I had a list of literally every ticker I was on. What? FTX at the time, FTX and finance. But I had a list of all the altcoin tickers, and I had, like, ta marked up on all them and alerts set on a ton of them. And that was basically my go to for when I need to get in and out of trades. I was doing that every single day, like, charting a ton of fucking alts. And then on the fundamental side, I was just pulling a lot of stuff from Twitter, from teams, direct pages.
00:02:46.398 - 00:03:10.540, Speaker B: Like I said, I use Twitter lists and stuff like that. And last cycle I had consumm which didn't have that many followers, but I was journaling all my ideas on there. So every month I'll be like, these are my core positions. This is what I'm looking at for next month. This is what happened last month. These are some news events coming up over the next few weeks. These are the different scenarios I'm looking at and how I'm going to play them.
00:03:10.540 - 00:03:56.562, Speaker B: And I still do that now, but now it's like I have way more access, I feel like, to information now that I didn't have before. Every day my telegram is just filled with messages from all different types of people. I'm like Ozzy having trouble keeping up with replying to people and then also trading because it's like I could literally just have combos with people. Literally all day. I'm trying to figure out how to balance. Like, I need to set aside some time to literally go through all my messages and shit now because there's so many of them, but it's still the same thing. I have ta alerts and stuff and then fa I do on the side, but most of it comes from Twitter.
00:03:56.562 - 00:04:16.846, Speaker B: That's where I live at, so I'm always on. People are like, dude, how are you working if you're on Twitter all the time? But it's like, that is my work. I'm reading stuff at the same time that I'm tweeting. I'm tweeting ideas, I'm asking people what they think on stuff. And all the retail sentiment is on Twitter. So it's all right there in the same place for me, for sure. It's like a stock trading floor, but.
00:04:16.868 - 00:04:36.660, Speaker C: Online, I think it's fair to say that the current meme coin craze going on on Salana, I mean, it's absolutely exploding at the moment. Things are doing sort of 10,000 x in a day. Do you think this is sort of regurgitating what we've seen before on ethereum, or do you think there is something new here, something fundamentally different?
00:04:37.270 - 00:05:19.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is a regurgitation. But the key here with Salana, I'll say it's two things. So earlier this year, I thought we were going to have a Solana Defi resurgence at some point, just because last cycle all the Solana Alts did terribly, like they had super high FDVs weren't in touch with the community, barely launched any actual protocols that people were using and just wrecked retail. The sole coin at just Solana was the only thing that really did well in that ecosystem. And then this cycle, I saw that there were a lot of Defi teams that have been working over the past couple of years, past year or so. None of them had tokens yet. I'm assuming at some point these teams are going to start launching tokens.
00:05:19.570 - 00:06:17.426, Speaker B: If you have that group of people looking to farm these airdrops, and then they see how much better Solana's UX is compared to these other chains, that can be a super reflexive thing that just can spiral really quickly. And that was my thesis earlier this year, and it's starting to play out now. So I think it is a part of that. Like, this is Solana's first DeFi real moment. But the cool thing is for Solana is that people are realizing you can do a lot of things on sol that you can't do on ETH because of how cheap and how fast it is. When you're aping shitcoins on Ethereum, you got to calculate how much you're going to be spending on gas, if stuff is spiked, or if the chain is congested. Whereas on Salana, I've literally seen people dollar cost average $10, $10, $10 into memes d five plays all the alts on chain, because you can do it at for under a penny per transaction.
00:06:17.426 - 00:06:49.114, Speaker B: I want to say it's less than a 10th of a penny per transaction. So a lot of the ETH guys are seeing that before, they didn't really care about testing the chain because there was nothing to trade. If there's nothing to trade there, then it's like, okay, what am I doing? I'm sending Solana back and forth to myself or to my friends. But if there's nothing to trade, you don't really get to see the full experience. And I think that's happening now, and that's why you have so much volume. Solana Dex volumes flipped ETH for the first time ever a few days ago, which is crazy. And I think that's going to be an ongoing trend.
00:06:49.114 - 00:07:09.380, Speaker B: You're going to have people who are in crypto or on ETH or other chains, they're going to experience Solana for the first time, be like, oh, this is worth using, in addition to whatever else I'm using. And then you have all these new retail people, and they don't care which chain, what means, what they're just going to use the best apps. So I think Solana benefits from that in a big way also.
00:07:09.990 - 00:07:40.590, Speaker A: So I agree with you, and that's a thesis we had here on the pod, too, earlier this year, which is a lot of Defi teams building tokens are going to come soon, and then that'll maybe create a wealth effect. And over time, people use Solana. But were you expecting all this to happen? So I guess soon or suddenly it's just insane. No, there's literally not anything to allocate into. Jupiter just came out, they had a gigantic FTV, and there's still a bunch of tokens to be released. What do you make of this recent mania around that ecosystem?
00:07:41.330 - 00:08:07.574, Speaker B: Man, I didn't expect it at all. I thought Q Four was going to be slow. I thought we were going to probably chop around with all the FTX estate selling that we had. That was supposed to happen in Q four. That's what I was expecting. I was like, in Q One, that's probably when stuff will rip. And literally right after they announced the FTX estate sales and Galaxy, I think they staked most of the soul that they had.
00:08:07.574 - 00:08:36.334, Speaker B: And then everybody was caught off sides because everybody was short thinking it was going to go down. And you had a ton of people who were waiting to fill positions like, oh, I have time. And at that point, it was just like, it just ripped because everybody was offside. And at the same time that it ripped was the same time that these Defi teams started dropping tokens. So it was just like a lot of stuff that happened all at the same time. But I did not expect bomb to go to, what, 2 billion or whatever it is now, 1.5 billion.
00:08:36.334 - 00:09:28.674, Speaker B: And then there's all these meme coins launching now. Just how it happened on uniswap, on ETH's D five summer in 2020. It was like a new launch every single day, and the group chat was going nuts every single day on Telegram. I remember that back in the day in 2020, everybody was hyped and you feel that same energy now where everybody's like nonstop looking for new launches to ape into. And it's kind of like a precursor for what I think the bull market is going to look like 2024, 2025, because right now it's us. There's some people outside of crypto who joined this year, but for the most part, people are not really talking about crypto all that much right now. So if we do get that spot, bitcoin ETF approval, which we'll likely get in January, after that happens, I think you're going to get a lot more attention on crypto, too.
00:09:28.674 - 00:09:50.710, Speaker B: And then if we break all time highs, which is usually the signal for people to be like, oh, I missed out on crypto again. Now I'm going to start buying. So we haven't had either of those things happen yet, which is why I think the next year, next couple of years are going to be crazy, because we're just starting basically on the attention side of things. We're really just starting for crypto.
00:09:51.370 - 00:10:34.518, Speaker C: It really feels that if you're going to bootstrap, like, a DFI ecosystem and have loads of coins and loads of TVL on the platform, it does kind of feel like meme coins. Shitcoins are the way to go because you can just launch 10,000 a day. They can shoot up to billions of dollars as we're seeing market cap for basically no work, and then that can sort of bring everyone over. So it really does feel that that is the way that if DFI is going to become huge on Seoul, that it is likely to start with meme coins. I think the other big driver was the GTO airdrop, because not only was it a lot of money, it was also to less than 10,000 wallets. And surely that just showed the whole industry that this is massively underallocated and there's a huge amount of money coming in. Yes.
00:10:34.518 - 00:10:42.954, Speaker C: What importance do you think the airdrops are going to have? And probably particular attention on Jupiter Airdrop? How do you think that's going to go, man?
00:10:42.992 - 00:11:41.180, Speaker B: I think they're going to be huge. The reason that GTO airdrop was so big also was because they prioritized all the smaller wallets. So it was 10,000 users, but even it was much more efficient to be sticking, like, one or two sold for a longer period of time than somebody who was farming with, like, millions, which is really good for the ecosystem, because it wasn't cyboled all that hard. If it was a cyboled airdrop, where it was like one few people with thousands of addresses, then if you do the airdrop and you incentivize the smaller users in that scenario, then you're not really doing a good job because it was cyboled like that. But it wasn't cyboled because nobody really cared about Solana at the time. So the people who got those airdrops were really the diehard Salana community members and typically were not whales. So after they got all this gas, now they have cash to spend in the ecosystem, and they're likely not going anywhere else.
00:11:41.180 - 00:12:15.682, Speaker B: If you've spent all this time on Solana before people, it was consensus that the chain is good to use and worth using. You're probably not going anywhere now that you just have more capital on chain to play around with. So I think all that money is likely to stay in Solana Defi and stay on the chain. And I think it will be similar with Jupiter, which is coming up. That's going to be a huge one. A lot of people have been yelling Jupiter's praises from the rooftops, comparing it to uniswap and one inch. It's just a really good product as an aggregator.
00:12:15.682 - 00:12:41.514, Speaker B: And they're also, I believe, working on. I know they just launched perps and they're also working on a launch pad to launch tokens. So that's going to be a monster. I think it's going to be multibillion dollar protocol for sure, this bull market, and they're doing 40% of the entire supply to the community in four different rounds. So this first round is 10%. I want to say it's trading around 0.5, like $0.50
00:12:41.514 - 00:12:42.254, Speaker B: or some 50.
00:12:42.292 - 00:12:44.020, Speaker C: $0.60 hit 70.
00:12:44.630 - 00:13:37.050, Speaker B: Yeah. So $0.70, which would be what, a $700 million stimulus package to Salana traders on top of all the meme coin stuff that's happening. That's why I get confused when people say we can't see the amount of craziness that we saw in 2020, 2021, but we're going to have the exact same type of set up. And with even more people joining in the market, that's going to be what? 700 million, and then they're going to be multiple rounds. So it also incentivizes people who aren't even on Salana now to continue using Jupiter in the future and moving forward. And then there's other stuff like Camino, I think marginfi Zeta markets drift, meteora like Parcel is also doing points programs.
00:13:37.050 - 00:13:58.150, Speaker B: There's a ton of different strong Solana teams that still don't have tokens. And now that the meme coins are moving, people have a reason to come over and trade. And while they're doing all this trading, they also get to check out all these different protocols that still are pre token. So I think it's just going to be even more reflexive than it is already, honestly.
00:13:58.810 - 00:14:28.130, Speaker A: So while we're on the topic of Solana, what about the underlying liquidity for Jupiter, like orca radium or some of these new Dexes do you think those are something worth looking at in terms of a play? I mean, they're making pretty good revenue. I think Orca's certainly, like, the market cap's gone up a decent amount just with all this mania. But I think that's being a bit overlooked by people who are just kind of over indexing on the fact that Jupiter is aggregating all this order flow.
00:14:29.590 - 00:15:04.982, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, I'm not sure which Dex plays I want to do. I know that a lot of the money from these meme coins, whenever they do top out, I'm thinking sometime in January, I think that those profits will flow into the stronger protocol. So stuff like orca, what else? Like radium, like all those. The defi teams, like GTO, stuff like that. I think those are going to get kind of that rotational flow of capital once meme coins do top out. One of the ones that's interesting, actually, is lafinity. Lafinity.
00:15:04.982 - 00:15:57.918, Speaker B: I think it's called Lafinity protocol. They're like, probably the most capital efficient decks, I want to say. So they're a lot smaller than orca, but they do, like, a comparative amount of volume with a lot less liquidity just because of how their design works. That's a pretty cool protocol. So I've been thinking about looking at that, that, and then also I think metaplex is like, they're basically like a monopoly on all the NFTs, the NFT ecosystem in Solana. Everything goes through them. And I think compressed NFTs are going to be a huge narrative for Solana this cycle, because you can mint millions of NFTs for like hundreds of dollars, whereas if you try to mint millions of NFTs on Ethereum, it doesn't even really make sense to do because of the cost.
00:15:57.918 - 00:16:18.920, Speaker B: But with compression, you can do this on Solana for super cheap. And metaplex is at the core of that. That's like another really strong team on solar that I think probably does well. But just generally, I do think it's going to be like the money flow from memes to the real protocols. That's typically how it works.
00:16:26.330 - 00:16:44.160, Speaker A: I wanted to kind of get into, I guess, what you're. And you're kind of alluding to it now, what you're excited about in the next year. It sounds like you think this meme coin season will at least have a local maxima. There'll be some rotation, but ecosystem wise, man, what's the deal with this dragon Ball z say thing.
00:16:47.570 - 00:17:41.966, Speaker B: Bro? My favorite thing about crypto is playing these rotations from like l one to l one to l one last cycle was kind of like the first time you saw it because it was the first DFI cycle we had. And then DFI popped off of ethereum, and every other chain was like, okay, well, we can make our own decks, we can make our own NFT, we can do our own whatever. So all of this capital is sloshing around in crypto, bridging from chain to chain, buying all these new launches on different places. But what typically happens in crypto is these l ones build their infrastructure first. And it takes a long time to build out the infrastructure because building blockchains is not an easy task to do. So they have all the tech, but then it's like there's nothing to do on the chain. You have these l ones who raise hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:17:41.966 - 00:18:23.310, Speaker B: They build out all the infra underneath, and then it's just like free open season for app developers to build whatever they want on chain. And at the same time as they go to Mainnet and you have traders looking for new stuff to ape. So the confluence of those things, when that happens, that's why you see these rotations happen on all the new chains, because there's literally nothing there. But they have so much money that these new protocols are going to get funded. And traders know that, and they want to get a piece of that early by being one of the earliest people to use the new stuff on chain. So, yeah, I was talking about say, I think say is interesting. It's a cosmos chain.
00:18:23.310 - 00:19:03.900, Speaker B: They're working on building out parallelized EVM on top of their current, I think, rust architecture that's built on top of the Cosmos SDK. They made some tweaks to their consensus. Algo for it to be faster than a lot of the other chains. I think their claims are to be like the fastest time to finality right now. And they're claiming to be able to do as much CPS as soul can do. And we'll see how true that is as these protocols launch on top of it. But that's the thesis behind say it's like as fast as Salana, but it's a Cosmos chain, and it's one of the newer l ones that also raised a ton of money.
00:19:03.900 - 00:19:55.020, Speaker B: So if you have all these memes popping up on Sol, you saw Avax had whatever, I think it's cockanoo just popped off, went to like 200 million. Then you have Huawei and Cosmos, which went to like 100 million. So these new chains are like, okay, what's the meme going to be on, say, or what's the meme going to be on? Injective? Or what's the meme going to be on these other ones before these d five protocols launch? And they put a poll out today and it was like, should we be sailors or should we beans? And I'm like, bro, Saiyans is way better than sailors. Saiyans is way better than sailors, but it doesn't exist yet. So it's like, now somebody, I'm assuming somebody's going to do it, somebody's going to make a meme of either sailors or saying there's something because there's nothing really to ape on, say right now. I have funds there, but it's like there's nothing to buy.
00:19:56.030 - 00:19:57.180, Speaker A: That is actually.
00:20:00.030 - 00:20:33.320, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what's definitely missing from all the narratives at the moment, as you say, say, injective Monad going to be releasing next year? The thing that's missing is Ethereum. What is Ethereum's catalyst right now? Because it's flipped literally in like the space of about a month or two to being full consensus. This is where all future trading is going to happen. Everything's going to settle on Ethereum to now everything is happening on these parallelized alt chains. So what exactly is going to be happening with Ethereum, do you think, during this next bull market?
00:20:34.570 - 00:21:10.258, Speaker B: Man, I wish I knew. The clarity I have on Ethereum's pivot from monolithic architecture to modular. And I've been saying this since early 2022 in my head. Previously, everything was happening on ETH main net execution. They weren't using any other chains. So it's easy to use ETH BTC as a gauge for how Ethereum is performing compared to bitcoin, and then also to other altcoins because it was just ETH. Now you have like ten different l two s.
00:21:10.258 - 00:21:34.310, Speaker B: All of them have their own tokens. They also all have different VCs backing them. So they're incentivized for these tokens to do well. They want their l two to be the best l two. On top of that, you also have competing data availability layers. So you have Celestia, which is focused purely on DA. I know right now it would be cheaper to post your data to Celestia rather than to post it to ETH.
00:21:34.310 - 00:22:07.778, Speaker B: And we'll see what those costs look like after EIP 44. I want to say once that is done, we'll see what the costs look like after. But then there's also near, which is working on data availability. There's also, I want to say, polygon avail, which is working on something similar. Eigen layer is also working on something similar. So Ethereum has a scenario now where they're kind of competing. I don't want to say competing, but if you grow the ETH ecosystem, it's like, what parts of it grows first? In my head.
00:22:07.778 - 00:23:21.562, Speaker B: So it's like before, say, one of the l two s does really well, and it's like the best execution layer. Are people going to buy the l two token, or are they going to buy ETH? And if all the execution is happening on this l two, are all the users and traders over there, are they going to be more likely to buy that l two token, or are they going to be more likely to buy ETH? And then you also have, if execution moves off of ETH, Mainnet, as execution moves off of ETH main net, the fees are going to go down, which means the burn is also going to go down. So in that gap of time where you have more activity on roll ups and less activity on main net, until the activity on roll ups is like 100 x, the amount that was previously on main net, the fee burn, like the fees, the burn, everything on ETH is going to go down. So that thesis around ultrasound money in the interim, in the short term, is also going to get hit a bit. So it's like, how much? Or what is the value of Ethereum if it's purely a settlement layer that's also not being used for DA and not being used for execution, and I have no idea what that looks like. That's why it's just unclear to me how the value gets distributed across the ecosystem. And I've been saying that for a while.
00:23:21.562 - 00:24:09.980, Speaker B: It's like you have Solana, where their focus is purely on throwing everything on the main chain fast as possible at the speed of light, whatever integrated L1, and then you have ETH, which is kind of focused on just being a settlement layer. But in the future, if Salana wanted to, they also could implement roll ups and implement l two s if necessary, if need be. They don't have to at this point in time, but in my head, that gap between ETH and soul is always going to have to close if the ux on Sol is better and it's faster and it's cheaper, and you can do everything on salana instead of needing to use different l two s to function. So I just think that gap is going to close. That's my main thesis for this cycle. But I have no idea what ETH is going to go to.
00:24:10.910 - 00:24:46.498, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you did a few tweets where you had some, I guess, price targets and one of them was like, ETH to ten k. Is that still in play? I think people are kind of too negative on ETH lately. Eigen layer just crossed 800 million in TVL. I think earlier today, after increasing the caps, theoretically some of these l two s that settle on Celestia, their fees will go down to. It could be even lower. To your point, once dank sharding or prototype sharding is out. So that gets you pretty close ish to the cheapness of Salana.
00:24:46.498 - 00:25:00.060, Speaker A: It's not quite there, but I feel like there are some tailwinds coming next year. So with that in mind, are we kind of overly bearish ETH or are these parallelized l ones just that much better?
00:25:01.310 - 00:25:33.862, Speaker B: I do think people are overly bearish ETH right now. I'm actually long ETH right now for the first time in a very long time. I do think people are overly bearish ETH. I don't think Ethereum is going anywhere. I don't think it's going to die out. And I think that bitcoin and Ethereum are always going to be the first things that these, what's the word? Like institutions and people outside of crypto with a ton of capital. I think Ethan BTC are by far and away the first things they're going to buy.
00:25:33.862 - 00:26:00.990, Speaker B: They're the most secure. They're the oldest coins. Ethereum moves very slow with its development, purely because they know that they focus more on security than anything else. And I don't think that's going to change moving forward. I don't think either is dead. I think that's silly for people to say that, but I just don't think it has as much upside as Solana. Some other things, but yeah, I don't think it's dead.
00:26:01.570 - 00:26:24.840, Speaker C: You mentioned security, and actually that brings up thought in my mind. I think this week you've been having a couple of arguments on Twitter about the hacks, the recent ETH based EVM hacks. Do you want to put your position forward? Is evm more risky, if you like, than some of these other virtual machines? Is it about the same? How are you viewing all of that?
00:26:27.690 - 00:27:21.162, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been arguing with people this week on this. I don't want to comment on it too much because I will say I'm not blockchain developer and I haven't built things on EVM versus the SVM versus the cosmos. So, speaking from a developer's perspective, I can't do that. But I think that it's clear that from a user perspective, that the security associated with smart contract risk is just as important as the security associated with chain security and the distribution of validators and how resistant it is to some outside entity attacking the chain. And I think that smart contract risks are actually much more important for these new users of all these ecosystems. So that's why I say, people always say, oh, ethereum is more secure than every other l one by a long shot. I don't necessarily think that's true, because to users it's the same thing.
00:27:21.162 - 00:28:00.760, Speaker B: You lose just as much using ETH dfI or playing around ETH NFTs, all these different protocols on ETH as you do on Salana, as you do on Avax as you do on all these other l ones. And it's more on Ethereum just because there's more capital there. But I don't think there's less risk associated from the user perspective with using ETH. That was my main point. And people were like, you don't know the difference between smart contract risk and chain security? I'm like, I know they're different things, but practically, from a user perspective, I just don't think it's true that the ETH is more secure than other l ones. That's why I said that.
00:28:01.530 - 00:28:07.750, Speaker C: Yeah. Whereas how much money have people lost from validators colluding and trying to steal?
00:28:12.270 - 00:28:51.234, Speaker B: It's all in theory. It's like, oh, well, in theory you can run a node on your raspberry PI. That means the ETH is more secure. I'm like, dude, a ton of the ETH validators are literally in AWS. If we want to be honest about if multiple nation states wanted to be like, you can't use Ethereum. I think that a lot of the biggest ETH applications that are like, user facing would literally just shut down a ton of stuff. I don't think we are in a state right now where we're that resistant to nation state attacks.
00:28:51.234 - 00:29:09.020, Speaker B: And that's not to say that we shouldn't be pushing towards that. I think that we should. I think that's one of the main focal points of crypto in general, but I don't think we're there yet. So I just think the claims that ETH is more secure for that reason solely, I don't think they're accurate. That was my main point.
00:29:09.790 - 00:29:29.780, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just always just funny, like, post the merge, we had that whole thing with ETH blocks being OFAC compliant, and that's literally an example of a centralizing vector complying to regulations. And that happened on ETH. So they have their own set of issues in that front, too.
00:29:30.710 - 00:29:44.520, Speaker B: Yeah, that's why I'm like, what are you all talking about? I'm here every day. I see what's happening here every day. You can't just make up stuff to me because I'm here all the time. Yeah.
00:29:50.910 - 00:30:28.760, Speaker A: What about thematically? Are there any, for instance, one thing that was obvious last cycle is gaming tokens. Most people's best trade, like Axie, step in a lot of funds, return the whole fund on that. What are you looking at thematically? Are you looking at gaming tokens? Are you looking at defi NFts? What's exciting you? Where do you think the biggest opportunities are? Because at least from my perspective, I think the ones that retail can at least understand and use tend to have the most pumpability and ability to just hit really crazy market caps. But how are you seeing this all play out in the next year or two?
00:30:30.330 - 00:31:10.802, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a few I'm looking at for games specifically. I think this cycle we're going to have just a lot better games. So previously, game five was an idea and a thesis, and I think it will play out. But last cycle we were just super early, so a lot of the games that were the biggest ones didn't really have years of development under their belt, and they were just like the first iteration of all these things. So this cycle we've had games that have been building for like, whatever, three years now, had a ton of funding raised last cycle. May have watched some NFT collections and some stuff last cycle, but have been building the game for years. And what people don't realize is games take a long time.
00:31:10.802 - 00:31:51.066, Speaker B: Well, good games take a long time to be built. And I think this cycle is when we'll see actual good, solid crypto games that people have been taking the time to build behind the scenes. So I do think Gamefi is going to look different than it did last cycle. That's like one of my thesis, and that's also easy for retail to get behind, like gaming and crypto. I think it's just an easy sell. Also, I think deepen, which is like decentralized physical infrastructure and real world assets, that's going to be a big one. Tradfi is going to eat that up from every different angle.
00:31:51.066 - 00:32:45.300, Speaker B: I'm fairly certain that's something that they understand and if you can convey what the advantage are of having certain assets on chain, or being able to have these distributed architectures globally, like coordination with a ton of different people, stuff like helium, stuff like hive Mapper. A lot of those different deep end plays I think are going to be really cool, especially because a lot of them have established partnerships with web two entities already. Like helium has a T mobile partnership. So that stamp of approval from an actual cell carrier globally, I think is big. And that's acknowledgment of. What's that word, like that narrative in crypto? I think that's acknowledgment. That's going to be a thing that's going to stick around for a while, and then I think AI is going to be big.
00:32:45.300 - 00:33:41.060, Speaker B: Honestly, I wish I had a cogent way to describe what exactly I think it's going to look like. I'm pretty confident that we're going to have some type of crazy AI X crypto bubble because they're both the newest, hottest things right now that everybody's talking about. Somebody's going to figure out a way to use crypto in an efficient way to work with these AI teams and this artificial intelligence movement. I think there's going to be some alignment there. Some of the interesting ways I've seen teams think about it is using extra GPU compute for the training of these training and inference of these AI models on the back end and just coordinating them through what protocol in one chain and doing the incentives through like a token. I think that could be cool. There's a few different teams doing that.
00:33:41.060 - 00:33:53.106, Speaker B: The AI one is. That's one I'm trying to figure out. I don't know what that looks like, but I'm pretty sure there's going to be something in the top ten that's Aix crypto.
00:33:53.298 - 00:34:45.382, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree, and it's super hard. We had render on actually a couple of weeks ago and yeah, I think what those guys are building and the history of that team is incredible, but something has to come out from the AI industry, you feel, and all the AI bots. And also there's this talk about AI agents using blockchains to interact with each other. So, I mean, it could just be that the L1s themselves are the beneficiaries. Just on that thought, do you think that there is a chance that the layer ones are going to end up being a bit like when the railroads came along, everyone was building railroads, trying to make money from them, and then eventually they sort of all lost money? Do you think there's a chance that the layer ones become a bit like that and just compete each other into the ground. In the end, they aren't actually worth a huge amount of money, and it's just these applications which are going to be built upon them which are going to be the true behemoth, I guess.
00:34:45.516 - 00:35:32.934, Speaker B: I agree and disagree with that. I think that a lot of the L1s are going to fail. So I don't think there's going to be a ton of L1s that are really successful. I'm confident that Salon is going to be one of the ones that is successful, and I think there's only going to be a few of them that survive long term. Long term. For me, I don't really see any l one that's purely the EVM in its current state surviving long term in crypto. It's either going to have to be something like Monad, where they're working on a ton of different optimizations behind the scenes to make it as fast as something like Salana, and they're literally basically redoing the entire EVM and a ton of other things to make it be able to handle over 10,000 transactions per second.
00:35:32.934 - 00:36:46.602, Speaker B: But any l one that can only do ten TPs and spikes fees consistently for users, I don't think that's not the end state for crypto. So I think on one hand, you're going to have a few L1s that do really well, and protocols are going to be able to deploy on those chains, and then on the other side of that, you're going to have application specific teams, whether those are roll ups, application specific roll ups, or those application specific chains like cosmos chains, something like that. I do think the biggest applications that really want their own chain or want their own roll up, I do think that's going to be another thing moving forward that they don't want to be on an L1 with a ton of other different protocols. And I think it makes the most sense for games. That's like one clear use case for me. There's no real reason that you need a game on the same chain as you have your lending, borrowing, protocol trading, your decentralized per protocol, all these other NFT trading. It makes sense for me that a game which is its own ecosystem and kind of like its own circular economy should have its own chain.
00:36:46.602 - 00:37:12.790, Speaker B: And that's like what the Avax guys have been pushing a ton with subnets. They're like games make a ton of sense for subnets because you can do whatever optimizations you want on those chains specific to the game and tailor it to your user. So I do think it's going to be two things. You're going to have a few l ones that do really well, and then on the opposite side, you're going to have application specific, either chains or roll ups that want, I guess, their own independence.
00:37:15.290 - 00:38:01.080, Speaker A: During this discussion we're just having now, it reminded me of one of the biggest surprises to me this past year, which was just the absolute explosion of ordinals, not just on bitcoin, but every single freeze. Just getting knocked out by these things. And it feels so similar to me to NFTs last cycle, early on, and even just ERc 20s in 2017, they felt stupid. Like, why are people trading these things? Why are they breaking everything? And I wonder now, are these going to become a thing with retail at scale? Is that the next primitive, speculative primitive that's going to pop off? It feels increasingly hard to write them off.
00:38:01.770 - 00:38:27.440, Speaker B: Yeah, bro. That was my first reaction, too. I was like, this makes no sense. Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to make altcoins on bitcoin, bro? We have Ethereum and we have Solana. We have altcoins. Like, why are you trying to do this? And then in my head, I was like, well, that probably means I should look at this more. Probably means I should look more into this.
00:38:27.440 - 00:39:01.622, Speaker B: I think inscriptions and ordinals are cool. I think really, they only really make sense, though, on chains where you don't have smart contract functionality. There's no reason that you need to do encryptions on E. That doesn't make sense to me. But doing inscriptions on something like bitcoin, I think that's interesting. And I do think there will be some of those collections that hold long term value. Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency, by far the best one for Providence.
00:39:01.622 - 00:39:33.374, Speaker B: That's the reason that crypto punks were really big on ETH, because they were, like, the first entity, one of the earliest ones on ETH, like the province there. And you have the same thing with these early inscriptions on bitcoin that I think will behave in the same way just because of. That's like bitcoin saying, it's purely oldest. Like, most secure. It's just a store value. And inscriptions make sense there. But what's interesting that I didn't think about, so somebody tweeted, I think it was stoic.
00:39:33.374 - 00:40:07.886, Speaker B: Stoic? Tweeted, who was making inscriptions on Celestia? Like, what the fuck are you guys doing? I was scrolling the timeline. I'm like, what the fuck? Inscriptions of Celestia. My initial reaction was like, dude, celestia doesn't even have smart context. What do you mean you're doing inscriptions on Celestia? And then Mustafa, like, quote, tweeted and dumped on me, bro. He's like, actually, data inscriptions make perfect sense for Celestia because of that. Like, that's all you can do on Celestia is post. That's literally all you can do on Celestia is post data.
00:40:07.886 - 00:40:41.458, Speaker B: So he's like, actually make a ton of sense on Celestia. That's an interesting one, too, because Celestia is never going to have altcoins. Yeah, they're never going to have, like, they're going to have roll ups that deploy on Celestia and they can have inscriptions. So that's like, the first inscription project on Celestia launched, I want to say a few days ago. I feel like that's something I should definitely buy. I haven't bought any yet, but that's something I think I should buy. But it was so funny because I tweeted it and I was like, with mad, laughing my ass off, like, hello, o's.
00:40:41.458 - 00:40:44.406, Speaker B: And I wake up and the founder's.
00:40:44.438 - 00:41:02.160, Speaker A: Like, well, actually, bro, that's a retcon if I've ever heard. Wandi, there's no way this dude was planning on inscriptions being a thing on Celestia. But now that you explain it that way, it actually does kind of make sense.
00:41:02.850 - 00:41:12.340, Speaker B: Yeah, I was like, okay, this kind of makes sense. But, yes, please stop, bro. Stop doing inscriptions on shit like Avax. Why are you doing that?
00:41:13.990 - 00:41:16.514, Speaker A: You're not a fan of the $400 gas fees, bro?
00:41:16.632 - 00:41:22.550, Speaker B: No, I'm not. I want to trade all coins. Let me trade the all coins.
00:41:27.690 - 00:42:01.300, Speaker C: I often wonder about this cycle. I feel like everyone is assuming it's going to be exactly like the last cycles. You know, we're going to hit the harveening day and, you know, suddenly everything's going to rip and it's going to go for about twelve to 18 months. And yet at the same time, we have started earlier, I would say, than we were all expecting, as we were discussing earlier in this episode. Do you think that maybe this cycle is actually going to be different? Because you know how the market loves to push against any consensus view, and it feels like this is probably the most consensus view, that twelve to 18 months, everyone sell. Is that how it's going to turn out, do you think?
00:42:02.710 - 00:42:59.558, Speaker B: I try not to have a strong thesis on what the top and price targets are going to look like, because I know that's going to fuck me up. I'd honestly rather respond to price action in real time. I really hate giving price targets because I know in my head it's not even really whether you're right or wrong. It's more so, like, mentally, if I think this is going to $100 and then it goes to $90, and I'm like, no, I know it's going to go to $100, and then I don't sell, it's going to fuck me up. And that fucks up a lot of people. So just generally, I think having price, like, hard, hard price targets in crypto or time frames in crypto is bad, just bad for markets in general. But the way I've been thinking about this upcoming cycle, and I've said this a lot, is that it's the last cycle where crypto is going to be a fringe idea for somebody who has no idea what crypto is.
00:42:59.558 - 00:43:26.078, Speaker B: So after this cycle, well, I want to say previous cycles, you've always had that group of people who are like, crypto is a scam. Crypto is not worth anything. There's no use in any of these protocols. And it dies a little bit cycle after cycle. But I think after, honestly, a lot of the time, they have good reasons for it. Like, if you have stuff like FTX, SBF, previous, we had a ton of ICOs that went to zero. Like previous one, we had whatever.
00:43:26.078 - 00:43:59.850, Speaker B: I don't know how many altcoins in 2014 were literally, like, just scams, pure scams. So a lot of people had reasons to think that about crypto and not really seeing the underlying fundamental value of the space. It's difficult to see if you don't take the time to do your research on your own. But this next cycle, if we do get this blackrock ETF approval, and then they stamp bitcoin as, like, this is safe for anybody to buy, anybody to allocate to. You're going to have a ton of boomers who already have real estate. They have gold, they have stocks, they have all those other assets. They're going to start buying bitcoin, whether that's like 0.5%,
00:43:59.850 - 00:44:53.290, Speaker B: 1% of their portfolio, they're going to start allocating to bitcoin. And I think once you have bitcoin in their heads as a viable asset to invest in, that opens the door for the rest of crypto to also be those type of assets comparable to stocks. Which is why this next cycle, I don't think it's going to be the last cycle where we bottom under a trillion, like, wherever next bear is, it's still going to be multi trillion dollar asset class. And when you're a multi trillion dollar asset class, we're not really that early anymore. People say we're not early now. I think we're still relatively early because we've only had Defi for one cycle and there's not really that many other, I want to say, huge crypto apps that have broken mainstream yet. We don't have a crypto game that's comparable to something like Roblox.
00:44:53.290 - 00:45:55.194, Speaker B: All these other sectors in crypto aren't really that big in the normie world yet. So I do think this cycle is going to be the last one for retail to be, like, super early to crypto. If thinking through that, it's like, this cycle may be longer than the other ones, because as we get bigger and it gets more accepted, I think at some point in the future we're going to trade more similarly to how stocks trade, which is like, we're not going to go -80% and the entire industry blows up. We'll pull back, we won't have these super big explosions. I don't think so. I do think we're going to get, like a parabolic move this cycle, but I just think the bottom is going to be a lot higher than previous cycles, like, significantly, just because of how many eyes we're going to have on crypto and how accepted it's going to be. So I've been doing comparables to 2016 2017, like that fractal where it was more so like two years of an uptrend.
00:45:55.194 - 00:46:20.390, Speaker B: But in 2016 2017, we really didn't have that many altcoins and that many use cases for smart contract platforms this cycle we do. So that's why I think it could be bigger in that way and like a two year type of uptrend at the same time that we have bitcoin getting its spot ETF approved. That's kind of how I've been thinking about it. I agree.
00:46:20.460 - 00:46:27.686, Speaker A: I think this is the last cycle that's going to be called a quote unquote cycle, I think, from now on.
00:46:27.708 - 00:46:28.280, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:29.210 - 00:46:46.720, Speaker A: That's not to say, like, crypto is going to go down or anything. To your point, it's actually just going to be at a much higher floor. It'll be more accepted, volatility will decrease substantially, and we're just going to slowly increase adoption over time after that, it's not going to be this radical thing where you're questioning your whole life after the thing.
00:46:47.250 - 00:46:55.966, Speaker B: Please, no more of that. Please, no more of that. Having a midlife cris, did I pick the wrong industry?
00:46:56.078 - 00:47:00.978, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been questioning that for the last year or so. Finally now I don't feel as bad.
00:47:01.064 - 00:47:03.700, Speaker C: Yeah, that's embarrassing, though.
00:47:06.150 - 00:47:27.900, Speaker A: What about just high level macro for next year? I think a lot of people are talking about, oh, no, it's going to have a pullback, a correction. But then you see these memes coming out, people waiting for that 20% correction or whatever, it doesn't happen and it just keeps mooting. Is this soft landing going to actually happen? How are you thinking about this stuff?
00:47:30.190 - 00:48:09.254, Speaker B: I think Q one is going to be more sideways down, honestly, than Q four has been. I want to say we're pretty close to getting to that soft landing that people have been talking about. A lot of people thought we're going to have a terrible recession this year and we really didn't like the economy held up pretty well. And even though we hiked a ton, it hasn't flowed through really, to unemployment or job losses. Slow spending really, for people yet. And I think the worst of it you probably see in Q one. I think that's the way I'm thinking about it right now.
00:48:09.254 - 00:48:43.282, Speaker B: So since we've ripped like what, five X plus a lot of alt, five X plus off the bottom, I think we're going to get a rally like a higher high. I don't think we touch like 50K, like 100 plus on Salana before we do the pullback. And I think probably like mid January is what I'm thinking. Like local top out and then probably chop around in Q one and then rip the rest of the year. That's what I'm thinking right now. But honestly, I didn't expect this year at all to be as good as it has. I know they've gotten inflation down to want to say, like, what is it, like 3.43.2,
00:48:43.282 - 00:49:29.102, Speaker B: something like that percent. So it's pretty close to their 2% target. And at the most recent, FOMC Powell has been a lot more. Dovish is the word, right? Like dovish as far as saying that they're probably not going to hike anymore, they're going to wait to see what happens. But it's like high likelihood now that rates have topped. So now it's just like, can the economy sustain rates being this high before they need to cut them again? And they've projected, I want to say, three rate cuts for next year in their dot plots. But the thing is, it's like even if the economy did start breaking or stuff did start falling apart, they've said so many times that we have the tools necessary to stimulate the economy if necessary.
00:49:29.102 - 00:50:06.240, Speaker B: So everybody already knows if stuff starts going poorly, they're just going to turn the faucet on again. And that's why stuff trades the way that it does, because it's like we're kind of stuck in this loop where they only have two really levers that they can pull and we know that they're going to pull that lever instead of letting us go into a depression. So it's like either we get a really terrible depression that breaks everything or we keep going back in this push and pull type of, type of situation. I think Q one, you'll probably get your pullback entries, but I think next year we break all time highs. That's my call.
00:50:07.890 - 00:50:08.302, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:08.356 - 00:50:23.710, Speaker C: I mean, the market is so addicted, isn't it, to the liquidity and the funding that they get from the Fed. It's like bad news is bullish basically, because you just know you're going to get bailed out and all they care about is just getting that liquidity injection. So it's just absolutely mental.
00:50:23.790 - 00:50:25.220, Speaker B: Yeah, crazy.
00:50:28.090 - 00:50:37.160, Speaker C: What are your spicy hot takes, would you say for 2024, 2025, anything shocking, controversial which you could see happening?
00:50:37.710 - 00:51:04.400, Speaker B: Yeah, let's see. I think my spiciest take is probably that Ethereum mainet Dex volume is under third by end of the year. Yeah, under third. That's my call. And ETH BTC doesn't make a new high. Those are probably my two.
00:51:04.870 - 00:51:08.370, Speaker C: As in there'll be two others doing more volume, is that what you're saying?
00:51:08.440 - 00:51:08.926, Speaker A: Yep.
00:51:09.038 - 00:51:12.594, Speaker C: At least two other blockchains and John. And name which ones?
00:51:12.792 - 00:51:18.100, Speaker B: Not naming which them. Solana, I think is one of them.
00:51:19.270 - 00:51:35.740, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a fair bet. So you subscribe to this barbell theory where it's going to be bitcoin and then these really high throughput chains and then the stuff in the middle like ETH is just going to not get as much love. I've been seeing that take a lot recently and it kind of makes sense.
00:51:37.390 - 00:52:18.114, Speaker B: And I've had that thesis for a long time. Even in early 22 I was writing about that. I think Cosmos is honestly underrated in how they approach the modular architecture. They were the ones who thought of that thesis before anybody else did. That was their entire game plan from the jump was like, we're going to make things very modular in how we design, not just for users, but also from a developer standpoint. We're going to be able to let you tweak things as you need to, whatever, build your own specific app chain for whatever your use case is. And now you have Celestia, which is deployed on Cosmos, and now you have that modular thesis being applied to roll ups.
00:52:18.114 - 00:52:34.234, Speaker B: So I think Cosmos is going to be really interesting this cycle from a roll up. My. That's probably one of my, uh, I don't know, the, um. Unexpected. Yeah. Hot take.
00:52:34.272 - 00:52:34.522, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:34.576 - 00:53:07.430, Speaker B: I think cosmos roll ups are going to be an interesting play. Stuff like, what's it called? Sovereign Labs, I want to say it's called. They're the team that's working on building out SDKs for sovereign rollups to build on top of Celestia, where sovereign rollups are roll ups that don't need to settle to some other blockchain like arbitrum. Optimism. All those roll ups settle on Ethereum, sovereign rollups post data to Celestia, but they don't need to settle to another chain. So they're sovereign in their own right. Basically the closest thing to app specific cosmos chains in the cosmos.
00:53:07.430 - 00:53:38.542, Speaker B: And then you also have dimension and Celestia, which are going to be working together. Dimension will be the modular settlement layer in the cosmos. And they're working on building out SDKs for roll apps, they call them, which is like roll up specific applications to build on dimension. And then they'll use IBC for communication under the hood. IBC is really cool. I don't think most people know that you can actually build fraud proofs into IBC, which is pretty dope.
00:53:38.606 - 00:54:04.426, Speaker C: Yeah, because I often think it's conflated really the app chain thesis and then the L two roll up thesis. And if you actually think where are the apps themselves being built? I don't really see that many actually being built in the ETH ecosystem. It tends to be more in the cosmos ecosystem, I'd say. So if the view is that there's going to be integrated chains and app chain thesis, then to me that's bullish cosmos. Not necessarily bullish ethereum at this point in time.
00:54:04.528 - 00:54:43.606, Speaker B: Yeah, I have the same thoughts. I think the reason that we have so many generalized l two s now is because of how badly ETH is at scaling. So you need these generalized l two s because literally, how bad of ETH is at scaling? I think in an ideal state, most of these roll ups are literally application specific roll ups. That's how I typically think about it. And then you have the L1s, integrated l ones on the other side, where protocols just deploy and get access to all the other protocols on the chain at the same time. It's like the integrated and modular barbell. Yeah, I think that's how I'm approaching it.
00:54:43.606 - 00:54:58.220, Speaker B: It's like if I have exposure to Solana, I got to figure out how to get approacher to the modular thesis also, because I have no idea which is going to win out long term, but I think they're diametrically opposed in a way that you need exposure to both of them.
00:55:00.050 - 00:55:28.870, Speaker A: That makes sense, I guess kind of a closing topic or question now that you're such a prominent figure in this space, you're probably dealing with a lot of people singing appraises, people have negative thoughts. How do you stay grounded through all of this? Because I'm sure this is only going to ratchet up even more. It's only going to get more insane. More people are going to be online. But what are you doing to kind of keep a level head throughout this whole mania?
00:55:29.610 - 00:56:11.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I tell my friends all the time, if I ever get cocky, to please tell me because please let me know if my personality changes. I think I'm typically pretty down to earth. I try to be as best as I can. When your head gets big, your head gets big in trading, when you hit a lot of trades back to back, like, oh, I hit this and I hit this and I hit this and I hit this, and I made this much money. I did all this. But if you do that and you also do it publicly in front of a ton of people, and then all those people who are like, yo, I did this because you did this and I made this much money, and my friends made this much money, like, oh, you're the goat. All that, that makes it even crazier.
00:56:11.490 - 00:56:39.850, Speaker B: It's like leverage on leverage. It's like double leverage. It is like the social leverage on top of the actual money that you made from the trade. And sometimes the social leverage is weird because I walk around in New York now. I was out on Saturday. I'm at just a random club, and dude comes up to me like, yo, I fuck with you. Like, I appreciate you.
00:56:39.850 - 00:57:08.006, Speaker B: I've made this much money off the drop, and I bought salon at 20. People come up to me now in person in New York because they know me from Twitter, and I'm one of the people that has my face and everything, doc, so people know what I look like. It's cool. It's honestly very cool. I'm glad that I've helped people. The downside of it is, like, when you're wrong, everybody's like, fuck you. Fuck you.
00:57:08.006 - 00:57:42.170, Speaker B: I lost this much money because I thought you said this. And then it's like, that's why I say, I try and tell people, you don't want to copy trade anybody on crypto Twitter. You never want to do that. What's better is to learn your process from the smartest people on crypto Twitter. So it's like, if you can learn how to take the trades from people who are taking the trades, then you don't need to copy trade anybody because you already know what to do. And that's why I also tell people to keep their portfolio separate from. Keep your degen shit separate from your spot long term positions.
00:57:42.170 - 00:58:15.740, Speaker B: So there's like, even if somebody is, whatever, they have bitcoin, they have ETH, maybe they have Solana, maybe they have some Coinbase stock, and they're like, holding that. It's hard to fuck up just holding stuff like that from the lows of a bear market unless you do something terribly, terribly wrong. Just close your eyes and never sell. When stuff goes five X, ten X Plus, it's hard to fuck up that side. So I tell people, literally do that. So you're not going to fuck up that part of your portfolio. And then all the other Djen shit, like you're trying to catch all these rotations bridging between eight different chains, buying meme coins at 500K market cap.
00:58:15.740 - 00:58:36.980, Speaker B: If you're going to lose your money, lose your money. Don't own the Djen shit. Don't fuck up the rest of your portfolio. But yeah, I feel like this next cycle is going to be weird. I got like 30K followers in the past month. And that's just like, just the end of this year. It's not even 2024.
00:58:36.980 - 00:58:39.380, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:58:40.630 - 00:58:48.310, Speaker A: I think you've been doing a great job. It's hard, man, because a lot of these guys on Twitter are anons. And you're kind of reputation.
00:58:50.330 - 00:59:32.062, Speaker B: Dude. Like this summer, the amount of people who are calling me all types of crazy shit under every single post, all I'm doing is saying, I think salon is going to go up. All I'm doing is I think the gap is going to close between Ethan, they're like, this guy's fucking retarded. Like I'm like, jesus. And they're all anon too. So it's like, anybody who's met me in person, and a lot of people from I've met a lot of people from crypto Twitter now, so they see I'm like hella combative online just because of how people do go back and forth, people online. But if you meet me in person, I'm very, very chill.
00:59:32.062 - 00:59:54.582, Speaker B: Even if you love ethereum, I'm not going to hit you. I don't care. So it's always funny to see the people who I know from crypto Twitter who know me in person, and whenever we meet up, they're like, yeah, dude, we have no idea why people are screaming at you on the Internet. It's funny, bro. It's funny.
00:59:54.646 - 00:59:59.226, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't get it either, man. It's crazy. These maladys, man.
00:59:59.328 - 01:00:02.780, Speaker B: Yeah, these are malady crew, bro.
01:00:04.530 - 01:00:27.566, Speaker A: But Z, thank you so much for coming on, sharing your wisdom. I think you've helped a lot of people in this space. Just learn how to. To your point, fish, right? Come up with a process, figure out why something should go up. Think critically about this ecosystem. We need more people like you to help educate the masses and kind of build in public, share your process. I think that's super valuable.
01:00:27.566 - 01:00:39.158, Speaker A: Not enough people are doing it. I think too many people hide behind anonymous profiles and it's a lot easier to do that. But you're actually putting yourself out there and we appreciate everything you do, man.
01:00:39.324 - 01:00:43.720, Speaker B: I appreciate you, bro. I appreciate you. Thank you. Definitely trying my best.
01:00:46.090 - 01:00:50.254, Speaker A: Looking forward to a fun cycle. I think this will be a crazy one.
01:00:50.412 - 01:00:51.690, Speaker B: If anything, it won't be boring.
