00:00:14.200 - 00:00:37.924, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered. I'm your host, Saul, and today it's just me hanging out with my friend Austin Barack. Austin was previously a partner on both the venture and liquid investment side at coin fund, but left believe this past December to start a fund of his own. And we're going to get into all that fun stuff throughout this interview. But Austin, it's great to see you. Welcome to Unlayered.
00:00:38.224 - 00:00:40.720, Speaker B: Thank you, Sal. It's great to be here.
00:00:40.912 - 00:00:51.404, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. I'm sure it's been really busy for you, man, because it seems like you left your previous job and started this new venture right in the holiday season when a lot of people are kind of winding down. How's that been?
00:00:52.004 - 00:01:32.634, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been good. I think one of the positives is working in crypto. Everyone's a little bit used to holidays are only holidays to the extent the market's not moving, so everyone's always a little bit plugged in. But it's been really nice to get started with my new venture. I'm launching a new fund called Relayer Capital, a hybrid liquid venture strategy, fundamental, thesis driven, really digging deep in a number of key verticals and ecosystems that I'm bullish on. And I've gotten a lot of support so far. So it's in the three weeks or so since I've kicked it off, it's been a great start.
00:01:32.794 - 00:01:47.664, Speaker A: That's super exciting. And obviously you've done investing for a while now. Is there, I guess, any key difference you would highlight between what you want to do with the fund versus what you were doing in your previous job, or do you want to kind of double down on what we were doing before?
00:01:48.324 - 00:03:31.184, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm happy to double down, at least give some background on what I was doing before and highlight some of the differences. Previously I was splitting my time between liquid strategies as well as pre seed, seed and series a, focusing on a number of key verticals and ecosystems, including defi, scalability, tech interoperability, modularity, deep in a lot of NFT infrastructure as well. And what I'm looking to do with the fund here is double down on those areas and segments that I'm most excited about. In particular, there's a couple ecosystems that I'll be that will have a notable but not exclusive focus, those being Solana and Avalanche, where I think it's actually quite complimentary, where Solana is this monolithic chain where everything is moving at the speed of light, everything is incredibly cheap and all interactions are entirely composable. And then avalanche with a parallel scaling via parallel chains and having incredibly customizable, flexible and varied levels of permissioning app chains that are really suitable for tri fi applications, asset tokenization, loyalty, engagement, gaming and others. So focusing a lot on those segments, probably more so than I did at coin fund, and also really digging deep on a lot of the protocols that learned from the earlier versions of what we've seen in crypto. And those segments include defi a lot within, deep in.
00:03:31.184 - 00:03:57.164, Speaker B: Really excited by what's happening, what we're seeing with helium and hivemapper and. And render a lot on the kind of new primitives that are emerging in NFT financialization and elsewhere. So yeah, definitely continuing a lot of the work that I've done and the investments that I was able to make and find success in a coin fund and really doubling down on those theses.
00:03:57.544 - 00:04:25.504, Speaker A: Amazing, amazing. See Austin, you're one of the most rare people in that you like avalanche and Solana. And so that's something I want to unpack a bit because it's not a very. There's not a ton of overlap there. I think obviously, as you alluded to, it's a very different philosophical approach to scaling blockchains and like what types of businesses or users would use something like a subnet versus an integrated blockchain like Solana. So maybe let's dive in a bit. It's not a topic we've talked about a lot.
00:04:25.504 - 00:04:53.350, Speaker A: Obviously there's been a huge ramp up in interest on avalanche gun is out there tweeting all kinds of crazy things about meme coins and a lot of conversation happening. So is your take that you think there's a unique type of user Persona or business that finds the permissioning that you could do on subnet interesting, whether it's KYC applications with Tradfi. What's your avalanche thesis? If you could distill it down for us?
00:04:53.542 - 00:06:01.994, Speaker B: Yeah, so my avalanche thesis is there's going to be applications that require incredible amounts of composability, and those are naturally going to want to be on an integrated chain like a solana, where you don't really have meaningful trade offs there. But there are going to also be applications where the level of composability that's required isn't necessarily as high. But also applications are looking to have distinct tokenomics that they're, you know, for their specific blockchain. They're looking to have different levels of permissioning, different levels of KYC, custom vms. And a lot of that is really kind of very easy and comes right out of the box with avalanche. And there's a couple ecosystems that I highlighted before that I think are particularly well suited for that. A lot of them are web two companies that are building loyalty engagement systems that want that hyper level of control and then also for traditional finance, settlement and asset tokenization.
00:06:01.994 - 00:06:39.764, Speaker B: When I say all of this, of course it's on a spectrum. Not everything happens in one place, not everything happens in the other, and we'll see a lot that happens across multiple environments. All of this is to say as well that I'm not necessarily not bullish on the EVM or all the development that's happening within l two s. And I think those are interesting approaches as well. But within Avalanche, that high level of customization, but also how much of it is really well packaged and comes out of the box is appealing for a lot of developers that I speak to.
00:06:40.064 - 00:07:07.704, Speaker A: Understood, I guess. How would a developer decide on a subnet versus an app chain in the cosmos ecosystem? Or even just building on a roll up or roll up as a service is a phenomenon. Now, from your conversations, how does one even begin to make a decision on what makes sense? Is there some technological primitive in avalanche that allows for cross subnet communication? That might be interesting. How do you think about all that?
00:07:08.134 - 00:08:39.764, Speaker B: Yeah, so you have the AWM, which is the equivalent of Cosmos IBC within Avalanche, that will allow for subnet communication and also communication with outside networks. You have the hyper SDK which allows for development of subnets with custom virtual machines and unique virtual machines. So there's a lot of flexibility there. Also leveraging Avalanche's consensus mechanism. So I think the difference between what you see on avalanche versus app chains or rollups as a service or cosmos applications is a lot of simplicity with development and how much of it is pre packaged, and also the flexibility to use different mix and match different virtual machines, different consensus mechanisms. And we've seen EVA labs be really supportive of projects in the ecosystem and not to take anything away from other ecosystems because there's a lot of really supportive folks. But I think particularly within web two corporates with, with traditional financial companies and what they're doing on the evergreen and spruce side with Wellington and Tro and JP Morgan and a bunch of others, they're making it a very smooth landing for onboarding.
00:08:40.784 - 00:09:07.814, Speaker A: And at what point? Because I know obviously been following you on Twitter forever and you were bull posting Solana for a long time. It seems like you maybe timed the bottom, so to speak. Like you noticed there was a bit of a overreaction post FTX we're pretty vocal about that. I mean, have you always been a supporter of Solana? Or did it really, like, hit you when everyone oversold at post FTX, then you kind of dove in, like, tell us a bit about that.
00:09:08.194 - 00:10:56.050, Speaker B: Yeah, so I've been very supportive of Solana pretty much since the beginning. I remember having a conversation in mid 2020 with Raj and talking about what he was building and being pretty blown away and also reading some of the early papers even before that. And the thing that really clicked for me in November and December of 2022 was this massive price disconnect versus what was happening on the ground, what the tech stack enabled, and how people in this massive contagion post FDX were thinking that Solana was somehow left for dead, when that really wasn't the case at all. And what we've seen and that allowed really nice, really nice positioning and the ability to get exposure at pretty attractive levels. I remember as I was seeing it crash from like, I think it was like, 1312, 1110, nine eight. And I think it, like, it bottomed like just below $8 and sending a message around, like, I'm not sure exactly what's happening and why this is crashing by 30%, but we need to be buyers here because it makes absolutely no sense. And that's what's driven a lot of my conviction through fourth quarter of last year and the first two quarters of this year, where we didn't necessarily see a ton of inflecting fundamentals on chain, but we had an ecosystem of incredibly talented builders building new primitives and things that it's become a meme of sort only possible on Solana.
00:10:56.050 - 00:12:09.110, Speaker B: But I think that's very true where when you look at the number of DPIn applications that are building on Solana, or migrating to Solana because of the throughput and capacity, lack of limitations on Solana, what we're seeing with compressed nfts and how that makes it so much easier for builders of a number of different applications beyond just like pfps and art to develop nfts. What we're seeing with novel DeFi systems, that really was evidence to me that we would see this massive growth later on because we had this pipeline of builders and we had such a robust tech stack. And that's eventually what ended up happening in the latter half of the year, where we had new assets come to market. That was actually one of the real blockers for Solana. For a while on the Defi side wasn't enough to trade. The NFT market was always second to Ethereum and like, orders of magnitude above everything else. And even after D Gods left, it was clearly evident, like, the liquidity was in Solana, the liquidity wasn't for D gods, so no one was going anywhere.
00:12:09.110 - 00:13:00.234, Speaker B: And you had a whole bunch of collections that were really, really popular. But on the DeFi side, there just wasn't enough to trade. Like you would trade Seoul or you would trade USDC. And then there were a couple small caps. But then what we saw with the growth of bonk, with pith coming to market, with Jitto coming to market, Jupiter is going to come to market and release the token later this month. And a whole bunch of other assets that are nearing release is we started to see this really, really robust DeFi ecosystem, all of this bolstered by pretty innovative points and incentive systems that attracted more capital, all these airdrops that made everyone realize outside of the Solana community, like, wait, hold on a second. There's a lot happening here.
00:13:00.234 - 00:13:40.514, Speaker B: Maybe we shouldn't just be farming Zksync and ETH L two s, and maybe there's actually a lot on Solana. So that spurred even more activity. We saw these Dex volume numbers that were massive and even surpassing Ethereum and that the reflexive nature of crypto really got everything going. So I guess to answer your original question and go back to what you were asking, I've always been really bullish on it, but post FTX, there was just in my mind this massive disconnect that didn't make sense. And that's where I thought it really makes sense to double down.
00:13:45.774 - 00:14:23.784, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree. And that's what I noticed, too, post FTX. I mean, I did a whole kind of deep dive into it and realized, one, they really didn't have that much to do with Solana after, like the first year when they worked together, they're kind of irrelevant as far as Solana ecosystem goes. Two, I was just at breakpoint, obviously, that happened right before FTX and all these new developments that were super exciting were happening and people were all bowled up. And three, theres still people filling up hacker houses theyre going to, the conferences theyre building, theres all these companies that already built really impressive things. And all that together has nothing to do with the price that exists. To your point, it was a huge disconnect that I think was obvious to me.
00:14:23.784 - 00:14:30.524, Speaker A: But if you just live in crypto, Twitter all day, all you hear is just fud about everything. Its easy to fall in that trap.
00:14:31.394 - 00:15:31.326, Speaker B: Yeah. One other thing there is also we saw issues with downtime on Solana in the past. And some of these narratives are really sticky, and people get an idea in their minds, and then they're like, well, this is what it is, so I'm not going to think about it again. And we've seen throughout 2022, and then, of course, throughout 2023, but even within 2022, incredible amount of hardening of the network and a lot of major upgrades that made the network faster, more reliable, implementing priority fees, implementing quick, improving how a lot of the architecture worked and the reliability of it. And that's not something that was, I think, well understood outside of folks that were following Solana really closely. So that was another piece where one FTX wasn't going to kill Solana. Solana is a thing of its own.
00:15:31.326 - 00:15:44.554, Speaker B: And then two, there had actually been really massive growth, not only in development of different verticals and builders, but in the technical architecture itself that wasn't widely understood.
00:15:44.974 - 00:16:08.080, Speaker A: For sure. For sure. And the point you made earlier, too, about just, it's clearly hit escape velocity. They were number one Dex volume in the last week or so, beating ETH and still top three. So that is clear to me that I feel like they're a major coming into this next cycle. What's now funny, though, is this idea of parallelized blockchains become a meme now. Even Polygon.
00:16:08.080 - 00:16:42.008, Speaker A: They changed their website. Oh, no, we're not ZK anymore. It turns out we were building parallel the entire time, say, came out. He's been doing a lot with on the meme coin side, and their numbers are looking pretty decent for an early ecosystem. People are all bowled up about Monad Sui Apdos as well. How do you think about these? I guess new challenger, scalable, parallelized blockchains, whatever you want to call them, because I don't think all of them can succeed. There's only so much demand on the development side.
00:16:42.008 - 00:16:53.354, Speaker A: It's very hard to bootstrap an ecosystem and have all the pieces there. So then how do you unpack on the infrastructure side of crypto, this new wave of, like, the parallelized blockchain meme?
00:16:54.174 - 00:18:00.700, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think to start off, it's a really powerful recognition of what Solana has been building for a very long time. And the fact that it's a meme now is validation that parallelized architecture and execution is the right approach, or at least one of the right approaches, and in particular, what it enables in that when you have parallelization, you can have things like local fee markets, where then, if you have one application with a lot of activity on a given chain, then it doesn't necessarily spike fees across the network. You don't have resource contention issues, and it makes things a lot more scalable and the user experience a lot smoother. So first of all, that's great validation of that technology. And I think just like positive that blockchain broadly is moving in this direction, then, well, what does this mean for other ecosystems that are trying to build parallelized systems? Parallelization of execution is not the only bottleneck. It's also state access.
00:18:00.700 - 00:19:07.630, Speaker B: And I think that's something that's really critical for folks to understand. And also these systems are complicated and take a long time to build. So Solana has a meaningful advantage in terms of being to market a lot earlier. I think the move based ecosystems like we're seeing in Sui and Aptos, and the movement subnet on avalanche as well, they're interesting, but one of the things that they need to achieve, and by no means do I think they won't be able to achieve it. But you need to build a developer network effect, and you need to build all of the tooling that makes it easier for developers to build. And you need to have indexing, and you need to have oracles, and you need to have all these primitives and systems in place so that you don't necessarily have to chew glass. Like it was the meme early on with Solana that, you know, the devs were really hardcore because they were chewing glass because all these systems weren't in place.
00:19:07.630 - 00:20:06.424, Speaker B: But actually all these systems are in place now, and it's a lot easier to build on Solana. So that's a hurdle other ecosystems and tech stacks will need to overcome. Also, I think we're seeing interesting approaches to parallelizing the EVM. But when you're parallelizing the EVM, you need to think about state access, but you also need to think about, like, is it EVM compatible down to the bytecode? Because then that determines whether you have a high level of compatibility with existing applications that are deployed in EVM environments for them to deploy in parallelized environments. Long story short, I love that people are moving in this direction. I think some are understanding that it's a narrative and are able to latch on, latch onto that, but there's a lot of interesting work happening.
00:20:07.284 - 00:20:47.964, Speaker A: So then on that point, we've touched on the app train thesis. We touched on parallelization. So then how do you think about, and you kind of alluded to it earlier with data access being a bottleneck, this modular approach with your celestias of the world and even Eigen Da and just building roll ups that settle to either ethereum or one of these DA providers. How do you see that playing out? Is it possible that all of these, are we all going to sing Kumbaya? Everyone has its own niche that works and it ends up with all these approaches? Or do you see any pitfalls with that modular approach that perhaps is not being appreciated by the market right now?
00:20:48.624 - 00:23:06.756, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think the DA side is really interesting, and I like what I'm seeing from Celestia and Eigen da in terms of or, you know, Eigen da not quite at that stage, Celestia a little bit further along in terms of providing improved DA solutions for blockchains to allow them to operate more efficiently and more cost effectively. One thing that's also not discussed a lot is I think Solana could actually be interesting for settlement and DA and is a surface area that hasn't been widely explored, but want to throw that in there, although it's not really a major priority in the market right now. But some of the pitfalls around modularity really come down to interoperability and composability. And do we need composability at an atomic level or not? And when we see all of these app chains, for example, like you have app chance developing on the optimism stack, and on the arbitrarily, on the arbitrum stack and on Zksync and elsewhere, and on polygon, being able to not only have these, these l two s and these application specific chains interact with each other when they exist in the same like optimism based super chain, but also to interact with arbitrum app chains and Zksync and Polygon and applications on Solana. So I think interoperability and improving the user experience and the speed of interoperability and the finality of interoperability is really important. And also shared sequencing will become a lot more important, specifically with ethereum l two s to improve that level of composability. As I mentioned before, there's a lot of applications that don't necessarily require a high level of composability, where app chains could be a really good fit, but all ecosystems require some level of composability, and many applications that are building as application specific chains require more composability than is necessarily possible right now within some of these stacks.
00:23:06.756 - 00:23:11.292, Speaker B: So shared sequencing will be a really important enabler there.
00:23:11.428 - 00:23:17.664, Speaker A: And can you quickly just give us a rundown? Because I think that's a term maybe a lot of our audience isn't familiar with what is shared sequencing.
00:23:18.124 - 00:24:03.242, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's shared sequencing. So a sequencer allows an l two to bundle transactions and settle them to another layer and process them. Right. And what we, what that means though is right now we have generally centralized sequencers. So the chain themselves is running those sequencers and they're also not decentralized. So there's a certain amount of risk that goes with relying on this one centralized party to run the sequencing and ordering of the transactions. With a shared sequencer, what that allows for is transactions to be ordered across multiple environments, often in a decentralized way.
00:24:03.242 - 00:24:14.574, Speaker B: And that what that would permit is composability across these different environments because they're being ordered in a shared way. So yeah, I think that's something that would be a really nice enabler.
00:24:14.914 - 00:24:22.574, Speaker A: Are there any particular l two s that are making inroads on shared sequencing? I guess it's not an area I've been focusing on lately.
00:24:23.194 - 00:24:59.264, Speaker B: Yeah. So arbitrum and optimism are focusing very heavily on it. Zksync as well. Polygon two, there are different levels of shared sequencing, and decentralized sequencing are two different things. So some are moving towards decentralized sequencing, some are working with shared sequencing providers, but it's in very, very early stages, not really deployed to Mainnet. Others, like Ometis for example, have a novel approach to decentralized sequencing. But I'm not super familiar with their shared sequencing plans.
00:24:59.264 - 00:25:14.664, Speaker B: But yeah, at the end of the day, all of these are still pretty experimental and not deployed to Mainnet. So in order to get the level of composability that I expect we'll need as we get a proliferation of app chains, it'll become quite critical.
00:25:15.404 - 00:25:53.914, Speaker A: Makes sense. Makes sense assuming we're in a world now with lots of blockchains. Right. Maybe they'll be modular, integrated, or some sort of an app chain. One question that comes to mind that I'm sure you've thought about pretty deeply is how do we deal with identity on chain? Are we just going to all be subservient to worldcoin and just, just do that? Or are you seeing any interesting experiments happening there? Because we can't have 300 l one s and then 300 identity providers do like, there has to be some sort of way to make this all kind of work together.
00:25:54.854 - 00:26:20.884, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's a really interesting question. One of the areas that I'm most excited about is a key enabler to pull in lots of users this cycle and make blockchains. Blockchain user experience a lot better. I actually led the investment, the early investment in Worldcoin at Coinfund. So know the team there really well. We invested. It was kind of end of 2020, early 2021.
00:26:20.884 - 00:27:17.514, Speaker B: And one of the things that made us really excited about what they were building was the level of privacy that was inherent in what they were building. Something where you're scanning your eyeball and using biometrics, unless there's that incredible level of privacy preservation, it's something we wouldn't have touched. And that's why we felt very comfortable because of how the system is architected. And we think they're building really cool things that allow for attestation of proof of personhood on chain and online that can eliminate botting within social networks, can make voting a lot more fair, and can enable one person, one vote in daos, and more civil resistant airdrops and other sorts of things. And I'm very excited to see what they build. They already have nearly 3 million users, and I think that's going to grow a lot from here. Other solutions.
00:27:17.514 - 00:28:30.114, Speaker B: So, for example, Manta Network and their ZKsvT, their ZK soul bound token, which allows users to attest to the behavior and actions they've taken on chain in a privacy preserving way, to get access to new protocols or features or airdrops, and do that in a cross chain manner. So I think they're building really interesting things, base in particular, and what Coinbase is doing, which will allow people to, without necessarily sharing any KYC data, attest that they're from a particular geography or meet some sort of requirement in the quote unquote real world, as far as being enabled for an on chain application, should be a major enabler as well. And then I think we'll see a lot of these more well integrated at the wallet layer where users are interacting directly. So, yeah, I think there's a couple interesting things that I'm seeing in market right now, but we'll need a lot more of these, and we'll need these systems to grow to be a lot bigger and to also overlap between the on chain and off chain world to get to where we need to get.
00:28:35.124 - 00:28:52.148, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah, I know a couple of interesting things you brought up. I mean, I noticed Mantis had a lot of inflows lately. I know they're using celestia for DA. I think they're one of the first to fully switch over, but I didn't realize they had this identity primitive. So that's something I want to look into. Super, super cool.
00:28:52.148 - 00:29:03.632, Speaker A: And then you mentioned Coinbase, are you saying that they can attest to? Like how do they get that information is what I'm asking. Is it tied to your KYC info on Coinbase exchange?
00:29:03.688 - 00:30:05.496, Speaker B: Yes, and I don't believe this product is live yet and also not aware of the exact plans for release dates and whatnot. But my understanding is they'll be able to use the KYC data of Coinbase users. But then a test on chain, for example, to an application that says that this is not a US user, for example, if the application wants to geofence against US users versus just using a VPN. Not saying that. I think that's necessarily the route applications should go as far as geofencing or this or that. There's a lot of complexity there. But that's one application where different blockchain smart contracts application would be able to attest, well, this user meets this requirement versus relying on other looser checks that are a little harder for them to get comfortable with, especially for them to be regulatory compliant.
00:30:05.640 - 00:31:01.354, Speaker A: So then, kind of putting crypto aside, one thing I've seen popping off on Twitter lately is so generally when you kyc on an exchange, you take a picture of yourself. Maybe you're holding a piece of paper with a date or something unique to verify it's really you. But what I'm seeing though, is now you can generate those images with something like mid journey or what have you, and so you're effectively defeating the entire point of verifying you're human. So that seems concerning. How do you think identity is going to work now? It feels to me like worldcoin, they've thought about this for years because they saw the writing on the wall, right? And that's why they leaned into biometric authentication. Are we going to have to kind of succumb to that being the solution to verify you're human? Because it feels to me like our current approaches with the cameras and stuff, we're already seeing the early innings of that getting pretty easily spoofed by generative AI.
00:31:02.174 - 00:31:46.948, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. And I think we may move in the direction of biometrics, although I think that'll probably take some time. I honestly haven't thought too deeply about this vector of attack and the requirements for KYC on the centralized side. One of the things that I don't know that necessarily worldcoin is the solution for this, because Worldcoin is all about proving unique personhood, but not necessarily tying that to a specific identity. So when you sign up for Worldcoin, they know that you are you and there's only one of you, but they don't know who you are or not. Like, the system doesn't.
00:31:46.996 - 00:31:47.548, Speaker A: Demographics.
00:31:47.596 - 00:32:46.974, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's not tied to, you know, an id or a name or anything like that. So I'm not sure that a solution like that is necessarily the answer, but it may lean more into biometrics or it may just require a broader tapestry of checks where instead of having one photo and an id, maybe it's something, as we've seen captchas evolve, where now there'll be a pie or there'll be a dartboard and darts in different numbers and it'll say, select it when the darts add up to ten. Here, solve some sort of question. And I think we may see, like, the evolution that we saw in CAPTCHA, that sort of evolution on the attestation of KYC, without necessarily going straight to biometrics. But, yeah, that's a really good question.
00:32:47.474 - 00:33:02.874, Speaker A: Yeah, it's something I think the world is going to have to grapple with pretty soon. I don't know the answer to that. It's super complicated. And then bringing all these questions on dystopian worlds where everyone knows who you are, where you are at any given time, and I don't know, it's important.
00:33:03.534 - 00:33:40.024, Speaker B: I was traveling the other day and I was going through security checks at JFK, like through TSA, and I was going to show the person my id and my boarding pass. He was like, oh, I don't need that. And then the camera just scanned my face and he said, you're good to go. And it was the first time I've ever experienced. And this wasn't clear or anything, this was just the traditional check. And I was pretty blown away. I'm like, on the one hand, I guess that's cool that they can do that, but on the other hand, like, wow, that's.
00:33:40.024 - 00:33:41.172, Speaker B: That's something.
00:33:41.268 - 00:33:42.060, Speaker A: Slippery slope.
00:33:42.092 - 00:33:42.260, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:42.292 - 00:34:05.164, Speaker A: I would just put those cameras in every street, in every corner. And, uh, you know, it gets a little scary a little quickly. Um, so one thing you mentioned that you kind of like an area of crypto, you like that, I think is heating up. And I get tons of questions on. This is deep. In just broadly, it feels like one of the best use cases of crypto. It feels like a really good fit for Solana, specifically in that network.
00:34:05.164 - 00:34:28.794, Speaker A: What's been exciting you in the deep end space? I noticed recently helium crossed like 30,000 or so nfts minted, which is insane. 30,000 people are using the helium network, which is obviously a blend of T Mobile and their network. But it's still very cool to see, seeing people talk about Hivemapper, but what else is out there? How are you thinking about this deepin space?
00:34:29.334 - 00:35:55.388, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm really, really excited about Deepin because people always ask the question, what is crypto achieve? What can you do in crypto that wasn't really possible before? And you can talk a lot within defi about decentralized swap and decentralized custody of assets, a lot of systems like that, but that doesn't necessarily resonate with everyone. And to a lot of people, it seems speculative in nature, although speculation is a use case not to be discounted, but on the deep inside, that's something that's very, very tangible and beyond pulling in lots of users to decentralize some of these physical infrastructure systems. It's really powerful as a narrative and as a messaging to get people more comfortable with blockchain technology. But specifically on the deep inside, helium is really, really fascinating. I have a Solana phone, a saga phone that's entirely powered by helium, which uses a combination, of course, the helium 5g network and T mobile as a backup. But the stats are moving in the direction where as far as like, data consumption, I think nearly 50% of it is coming from helium nodes and only a little bit more from T Mobile. So it's not orders of magnitude, it's different.
00:35:55.388 - 00:36:35.194, Speaker B: And the cost advantages in particular that you get in DPIn, where you can have a nationwide 5g network for dollar 20 a month, that's not really possible elsewhere. And also with the sagaphone, I'm earning literally $7 a day in mobile tokens. So I think unlocking the ability for people to participate in these networks and earn, like Hivemapper, you are Google Maps and you are contributing to the network, but also to be able to get these services at a drastically lower cost is pretty incredible.
00:36:35.574 - 00:37:31.886, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I mean, deepen always made sense just from the perspective of it is impossible to get this kind of coverage as a single company. There's just too many long tail edge cases. Right. It's a lot easier to try to incentivize people to coordinate and help you build out that network, whether it's mapping data, whether it's 5g coverage and hotspots and things like that. I guess the questions I've always had, though, are, I understand it's not speculative in theory, but when you have a token that moves up and down and you're trying to earn these things, whether you're having a node running or whatever you're trying to incentivize the consumer to do, there's a lot of volatility there. I've been rugged before, so to speak, running something where the reward token basically went to zero. Then I just have all this thousand dollar equipment that's effectively useless versus previous attempts.
00:37:31.886 - 00:37:45.274, Speaker A: Because obviously helium has been around for a while. They're focused on iot before. What do you think they're doing differently now to balance that supply and demand of token and ensure that this can be a sustainable growth to incentivize people over the long term?
00:37:46.294 - 00:38:39.064, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. And I've been following helium for a long time, but have turned a lot more bullish in recent months because of some of these changes. And the changes really come down to the demand side of the equation. Most deep end networks are focused early on on bootstrapping the supply side. So that's the number of people running nodes, the number of people provisioning services, the number of devices providing computer, depending on what the type of network is. And you'll see this speculative growth in the asset as people are really excited about the potential for what that can achieve. But ultimately the token ends up crashing if no one actually uses the services that these systems are provisioning.
00:38:39.064 - 00:39:29.028, Speaker B: And the one really cool thing about helium that we've seen so far is that people are actually using the phone. And I know it's not, it's tens of thousands right now. It's not hundreds of thousands or millions of users, but we're seeing a real product that people really want to use. And I mean, it's funny sometimes the strange ways these things get catalyst to some extent, the sagaphone's been out for a while and helium mobile has been available for a while. But it's only when bonk started going crazy that everyone's like, wait, I can actually get a free phone because I'm getting $600 worth of bonk tokens from the airdrop. The phone only cost $600, but things get catalyzed for weird reasons. But at the end of the day, people are now aware of everything that's happening.
00:39:29.028 - 00:40:26.814, Speaker B: And the other day I was describing helium to my dad who follows blockchain a little bit but not super deeply. And he's like, wait, can you sign me up for this? I want to get a saga phone. I'm like, well, it's sold out so I got to let you know soon. But it's like, I can hook you up with helio because you can use it on, on other phones too. But yeah, it's that sort of thing where when you have a product that's in the market that's really widely usable, then and the flywheel starts moving can be really powerful. I think the trouble with helium in the earlier iteration is like on the Iot protocol, it was much more corporate leaning, and the sales cycles there are much longer. So it's harder to bootstrap demand and to bootstrap demand in a viral way where the 5G mobile phone network is much more retail oriented.
00:40:26.814 - 00:40:30.474, Speaker B: So you can see the growth curves look very different.
00:40:30.974 - 00:41:21.374, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure, for sure. And I guess kind of staying on this topic, so it makes sense when you're introducing a token incentive to do something, whether it's spinning up a spot or lending your gpu's on your computer for compute jobs, that's pretty easy to do. You just click a few buttons or you set something up one time and then you're passively earning tokens, theoretically, and you're providing coverage for your network. That's great. But what about some of these more challenging use cases, whether it's like decentralizing Doordash or Uber or even Airbnb, where now you're involving humans, there's more interactions happening, there's more coordination required. Do you think deepen still has a shot at disintermediating those industries which have historically really high take rates?
00:41:22.234 - 00:42:31.528, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they do, but to your point, it's a lot more complicated. Teleport is an example of a really cool company that's trying to decentralize Uber and build exactly what you are describing. And there's the decentralized network that matches cars with drivers, sorry, drivers with riders and all of the routing. But on the other hand, you need to do quality checks. You need to make sure that you have safety guarantees that you have the right drivers on the network. And that's something that's a lot easier to do on the centralized side. And we've seen networks try and solve for these decentralized networks, try and solve for some of these things, but they're often not fast enough or there isn't high enough participation levels to say, like, you're gonna boot out a bad actor in the right period of time or make the necessary judgment, or just have the human touch that's required.
00:42:31.528 - 00:43:10.034, Speaker B: So I think for those sorts of systems, you're going to need a hybrid where perhaps you have a decentralized protocol that does all of the matching. But then you can also have centralized businesses that build on top of them that provide those add on services. But it's also these networks can be permissionless to anyone that wants to build on those add on services. So this way, perhaps instead of the take rate being Uber or Lyft or taking 25% to 30% of fees, maybe they're only taking 5% because they're not actually doing all of the matching and all of the payments orchestration, but they're only doing the higher touch stuff above it.
00:43:10.614 - 00:43:48.474, Speaker A: Right, right. Gotcha. So, yeah, they're like the underlying infrastructure almost, in a way, just like how MVNOs work with mobile networks, where you're borrowing some and just wrapping it in an interface, changing the business model, but you're not doing the heavy lifting. That makes a ton of sense. It's a good way to think about it. So, kind of skating into, I guess, the last major topic area to explore, 2024, seems like it's poised to be a pretty interesting year. A lot is happening outside of crypto, macroeconomically, election year, inside of crypto, it seems like we're in the early innings of a bull run.
00:43:48.474 - 00:43:57.904, Speaker A: What do you think is going to happen this year? Are we about to full send, or is there going to be a pullback? How do we think about 2024?
00:43:58.244 - 00:45:03.304, Speaker B: So I think we'll very likely have combinations of full sends and pullbacks, so we'll see all of that. There's always a lot of volatility, but I think 2024 is poised to be really, a really big year. I think just early on, we're likely to see bitcoin spot ETF happen on the shorter term, potentially even in January, which is what it looks like it's pointing to. And I've done a bunch of analysis on what it looked like and what the inflows were when we saw the first us based spot gold ETF. And that was the release of GLD in November of 2004. And granted, gold is an asset that's more mature by thousands of years. So fully acknowledging that, but also the fact that in 2004, ETF markets were much, much less developed than they are today.
00:45:03.304 - 00:45:42.694, Speaker B: And also, I think there's decently comparable levels of demand. There's a lot of institutional demand for bitcoin. I think we could see pretty similar, if not faster, inflows than what we saw with GLD in 2004, with what we could see with the bitcoin spot ETF's. And there we saw $1 billion in the first few days. And now these bitcoin spot ETF's. I think GLD has like 50 something billion in Aum, and all us spot gold ETF's have around 115. And I think we could get near those numbers relatively quickly.
00:45:42.694 - 00:46:41.160, Speaker B: And as much as crypto has become a lot deeper of a market, from a liquidity perspective, if you get hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars in a matter of days and weeks, as inflows into bitcoin, we're going to see massive moves. And we always see with the wealth effect of bitcoin, once we see those increases, that often flows into other assets. And that's just on the bitcoin spot ETF side, almost the smallest part of it. But there's so many industries and ecosystems and virto that are maturing, whether it's like on chain derivatives, whether it's DPIn, whether it's nfts, beyond pfps and art for other use cases, like even gaming, we have a whole bunch of AAA games coming to market. So, like, I'm very excited about 2024. Not financial advice or anything, but I think we're going to be at all time highs at some point this year.
00:46:41.232 - 00:46:59.504, Speaker A: Oh, this year. Interesting. Okay. Okay, I'll earmark that one. I'll hold you to it. And I guess kind of a final question here. I think I saw you tweet recently that you were going to come out with some predictions for 2024.
00:46:59.504 - 00:47:02.824, Speaker A: Maybe you already did and I just missed it. What were those?
00:47:03.244 - 00:47:14.900, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm finalizing the post. Haven't come out with them yet, so will be released relatively soon. But I'm happy to walk you through a couple of them.
00:47:14.972 - 00:47:15.584, Speaker A: Sure.
00:47:15.884 - 00:47:48.118, Speaker B: One of them is we'll see networks adopt parallelization strategies. We already talked about that. I think that's a narrative that's already in full force. I think we're also going to see a really big focus on the difference between one cent and twenty cents and sub ascent in fees, where $0.05 or $0.10 or $0.15 in the context of a five dollar fee often seems much better.
00:47:48.118 - 00:48:54.372, Speaker B: But I think people will differentiate that a fraction of a penny or 100th or a thousandth of a penny really enables a lot of different use cases. And networks try and move in that direction where, you know, a few cents is not necessarily cheap enough. I think we're going to see a lot of growth in ecosystems that, like, understand the friction points that their tokenomics have created and move away from those friction points. So, like one, for example, avalanche is moving away from requiring all validators to hold 2000 Avax and also to validate the primary network. And that, at least from a tri fi perspective, is a big blocker, because JPMorgan doesn't necessarily feel comfortable validating any transaction on a permissionless network, but doesn't mean that they don't want to have their own app chain or for example like Dot 2.0 and the tokenomics there. That was a massive blocker that app chains needed to acquire all of this dot to secure a parachain slot.
00:48:54.372 - 00:49:56.416, Speaker B: But if you move to the model of runtime leasing, similar to like using an AWS, that makes it a lot easier. So I wouldn't necessarily discount what we can see in the Polkadot ecosystem with some of those changes. Interesting. I'll run through a couple more if that's cool. Yeah, I think oracles will actively begin to monetize, and I think that's through a combination of OEV Oracle extractable value, as well as securing a percentage of revenue of the applications that they're serving, which in my opinion is actually quite reasonable because many of these applications really wouldn't be possible without the data that the oracles are providing. So I think it's only fair that they get some percentage of that revenue. I think we'll get more mind sharing, early adoption and data availability on the user onboarding and incentive design system.
00:49:56.416 - 00:50:59.024, Speaker B: I think we'll see really, really cool experimentation and growth of the trends that we saw in 2023. So, like point systems, for example, I don't think that's going to be limited for the most part to just protocols that haven't yet released a token. I think we're going to see that happen on an ongoing basis, even if the token is already live, as a way to incentivize behavior for subsequent airdrops. And I think we'll see lots of examples of airdrops for tokens that maybe even have been out for two years, not necessarily just like the example of the multiple airdrops for Jupiter where they're planning that ahead of time. I think that could be a new strategy. On the Solana side, I think we'll see a lot of teams targeting saga Genesis NFT holders, and I think the value of airdrops in 2024 will exceed $25,000. Could be even more for the phone.
00:50:59.024 - 00:51:56.724, Speaker B: Yeah, just of the phone. And of course that will be a combination of like price appreciation and the amount of airdrops. But I think that's an OG community of 20,000 people that is going to be really, really highly targeted. And then I guess one of the last ones on the DeFi side seeing really interesting evolution of user experience and decentralization for perpetuals protocols. And today less than 2% of crypto derivatives trading happens on chain. And that's historically been because the user experience has just not been on par with centralized exchanges both in terms of like retail interaction and front end, but also just speed of execution and latency. And with upgrades we've seen with dy DxV four and synthetix V three and then the rollout of Infinix exchange, all of that's improving.
00:51:56.724 - 00:52:03.844, Speaker B: So I think we'll see a pretty meaningful growth in the percentage of derivative activities that happens on chain.
00:52:04.224 - 00:52:13.724, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, this is quite a list. It's very good. Looking forward to seeing the full post whenever you put it out. That was awesome. Awesome. I think we covered a lot of topics.
00:52:13.724 - 00:52:20.944, Speaker A: This is super fun conversation and yeah, looking forward to watching what you do with this new fun, super exciting time for you.
00:52:21.284 - 00:52:25.564, Speaker B: Thanks. It's great to chat and looking forward to hopping on again.
