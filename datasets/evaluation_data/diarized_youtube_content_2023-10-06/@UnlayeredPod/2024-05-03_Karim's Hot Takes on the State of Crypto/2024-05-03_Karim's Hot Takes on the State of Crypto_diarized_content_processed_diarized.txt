00:00:15.000 - 00:00:34.914, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered. Today we have a bit of a different format episode. It's just going to be me today. And joining us is my former colleague Kareem. We work together at Galaxy and the research desk. And before that, Kareem was actually metrics, helping build one of their early products. And Kareem, catch us up on what you're up to these days now.
00:00:35.534 - 00:00:48.234, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me on, Sol. Yeah, these days I am working on glass markets, which is a liquidity analytics platform for token projects and also news trading.
00:00:50.334 - 00:00:54.290, Speaker A: Nice, nice. And also very active on friend tech.
00:00:54.462 - 00:01:00.614, Speaker B: Yeah, a little, little. I'll fire off my hot takes there. Hoping to squeeze in a couple here as well.
00:01:01.394 - 00:01:23.612, Speaker A: Oh, for sure, for sure. I mean, let's just talk a bit about where we're at. A year ago, pre FTX crypto was kind of slowly grinding into a bear market, but it wasn't full bear yet. People were still like this stuff. And when I say people, I refer to regular mainstream people, mainstream vc's, even. Things were looking a lot better a year ago. And here we are.
00:01:23.612 - 00:01:34.584, Speaker A: Fast forward. The clocks were post FTX, we're post a lot of pain and suffering and things like that. How are you holding up? How are you feeling about markets? Do you think this turns anytime soon?
00:01:36.204 - 00:02:09.684, Speaker B: I do not think we are going to be entering a bull market anytime soon unless we see an ETF approval. And so I think kind of just like it's entirely dependent on that, I think if we do see an ETF approval, we'll start to see new inflows into crypto that we had not had previously. Barring that, I think we're just going to continue to see liquidity drying up and path of least resistance there is. Flat to down.
00:02:11.884 - 00:02:14.424, Speaker A: Love that. Flat to down. Heard it here first.
00:02:17.004 - 00:02:36.864, Speaker B: But I think I don't have a strong view on this. I'm generally flat, barring some upcoming event or catalyst, because, yeah, this is flat to down is a tough direction to trade. Yeah.
00:02:37.704 - 00:03:12.704, Speaker A: You've been around the block for a minute now, and when I think about this current environment, it reminds me a lot of 2018, 2019, but somehow it's worse. Does that make sense? Somehow this feels harder in some ways because back then, crypto didn't really have any real products. No one used it for anything besides icos. All the icos dried up. They went to zero basically over time. But now it's like a lot of money has been injected in this ecosystem. A lot of jobs were created, a lot of products were attempted, and then they're still now kind of fizzling out.
00:03:12.704 - 00:03:16.884, Speaker A: How do you feel about this market in particular and compared to past bear markets?
00:03:16.964 - 00:03:21.744, Speaker B: No, totally. I mean, I think the feeling you're talking about, that's the feeling of letting people down.
00:03:23.924 - 00:03:24.636, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:24.780 - 00:03:56.884, Speaker B: I think if you're in this industry, it's one you're very familiar with at this point, but no, I can. Yeah, it's a bear market. It's like, it feels, to me it feels pretty similar. But I can see how just depending on your positioning, it would feel a little better, a little worse. A lot of people made a lot of money in the last few months just on doing all the on chain stuff, but that started to die down a little bit now and it's a nice little bear market rally. But broadly. Yeah.
00:03:56.884 - 00:04:15.864, Speaker B: I think it's tough to look at the situation with inflows and be like, oh, things are just dandy in absolute terms. I don't really have a great comparison to whether this is better or worse than PT 19, but pretty bad. It's pretty. It's not great.
00:04:17.404 - 00:04:30.944, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, you mentioned the ETF thing. Do you think a lot of that has to do with just how the next election might turn out or do you think there's any pressure for that to happen before then in the next year or so?
00:04:31.504 - 00:04:49.364, Speaker B: I have very little visibility into the internal workings of the us government. Right. And I think we can speculate all we want on it, but I think broadly, people seem to be saying this is going to be the odds that it's accepted are likelier than the probability that's denied.
00:04:50.064 - 00:04:50.520, Speaker A: Sure.
00:04:50.592 - 00:05:02.704, Speaker B: And just my gut kind of tends to agree with that, but I think. But it's all about just making sure that your accounts are funded and that you're ready to trade it when we actually know.
00:05:04.324 - 00:05:23.554, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, speaking of funded accounts, what's going on with Binance? Man? I have no insight into what's happening, but why is there so much fud lately? Is it based on anything real? I mean, obviously the us stuff is interesting with all those layoffs and the CEO leaving, but there's got to be more to this story, right?
00:05:23.724 - 00:05:47.474, Speaker B: Four? No. Yeah. I don't know. That's another one where it's just like, it's so opaque. I think at this point it's just like the only thing you can really say is not your keys, not your coins. Obviously, like I said, got to keep your accounts funded, especially if you're actively trading around any sort of anything. And so it's just a cost of doing business.
00:05:47.474 - 00:06:49.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. It seems like there's some truth to it that there's a lot of the stuff that we've seen around Binance is potentially raising yellow flags, but then also just, I think people broadly are kind of maybe trying to draw trends where there may not be any. So I don't know, I don't have any special visibility into it. Binance so far has generally been a pretty good actor in the space. I think they haven't done anything particularly terrible that other, especially if you just compare them to a lot of their peer group. And so I tend to kind of bias toward not assuming guilt where they haven't really given a ton of evidence that there's any sort of massive fraud going on. They also do have reserves on chain, which is just something that like FTX just didn't have.
00:06:49.434 - 00:07:33.734, Speaker B: So it's possible that there's some weird loan around that and that they have a lot of off chain liabilities that they're not reporting or that they somehow spoofed the reserves. All of those are possible, but just. It would be a much more complex conspiracy than what we saw coming out of FTX and Alameda if it is the case. And I think that kind of like, biases me a little bit to be like, let's not jump to conclusions too early. That said, sure, always got to keep most of your stack off. Exchange a little sus. Only the paranoid survive, especially in this industry.
00:07:34.954 - 00:08:04.042, Speaker A: Yeah, it doesn't cost you anything to just pull it off. Exchange. It actually, it reminds me of an earlier conversation we had maybe six months ago at this point where you told me you're a centralized exchange, Maxi. And so I wanted to revisit that hypothesis and just walk us through what you meant by that at the time. And maybe has it changed? Are there just some things that are really hard to do on chain that you will always need a sex for? How do you think about that?
00:08:04.178 - 00:08:31.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the answer is all of it. All of it's just hard to do on exchange. And on Ethereum, you've seen all of these wacky workarounds to try to minimize gas consumption, all of that. I think this is quickly becoming the consensus view that amms just don't really work all that well. Sure. Impermanent loss, all of that. It's basically just the retail he's getting bled out.
00:08:31.414 - 00:10:08.850, Speaker B: That works as long as you can finance it with yield farms effectively and new emissions. If you're not getting some juice outside of the actual inherent protocol, you should just not really be lp ing in any sort of v two style pool at any time, unless you're launching, it's obviously different if you're launching a new token and you're seeding the initial liquidity there and then it's just a bit of a cost of doing business, but really in large part that's just generally proven to be not profitable. And then v three is an attempt to kind of bring an order book onto the exchange, onto the chain, but it's still not that good. And you still have to pay gas to place these kind of quasi limit orders, which unless you're actively managing it, they can really only work against you in the sense that it's like you'll only get the toxic fills, you won't get. Yeah, you won't get it. You're not going to get a nice little, let's say, bitcoin or let's say eth drops and then immediately rallies back and you had placed a limit order that's just like, like very optimistic on say, your favorite centralized exchange and it failed. And like, whoa, you made a bunch of money now on v three unless you immediately yank the lp position, which there are tools to do this now, but you are paying gas twice unless you do that.
00:10:08.850 - 00:10:31.524, Speaker B: You are now just exactly back where you started, plus a couple of a little money in fees that just does not at all compensate you for the amount of risk that you took. And then, yeah, I think there's a lot of people trying to do limit quarter books as well on chain. To be honest, I've not been following it super, super closely.
00:10:32.264 - 00:10:32.888, Speaker A: Sure.
00:10:33.016 - 00:11:20.104, Speaker B: If you actually have to submit orders to the chain though, to actually provide liquidity, that's going to be, and especially if you have to pay gas to remove liquidity, that is going to be a major, major barrier. So I think what youve kind of seen is a lot of people try to adopt something somewhere in the middle, but then you are just back to taking a lot of the same custodial risks that you would have if you had just skipped all the theater and gone full centralized. Yeah, I would say from the designs that ive seen, I generally tend to prefer centralized exchanges with preferably ones that look solvent and take that how you will.
00:11:22.364 - 00:12:04.984, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I get the preference too. That's kind of why I bring up these topics, is you start creating these paradigms where a lot of power gets concentrated in the hands of a handful of exchanges. I mean, binance is the king of that, and they embody that to the table. And so, yeah, I mean, the product works great until there's all this fud and FOMO, or not FOMO. Sorry, FuD and doubt about are they solvent or is there something going on here that truthfully, no one really has insight to, including any government? I don't really know. Where are they domiciled? It's just kind of this decentralized, almost corporation that doesn't even have a.
00:12:04.984 - 00:12:10.124, Speaker A: I don't even think the answer to anybody at this point. Am I wrong on that?
00:12:10.544 - 00:12:22.844, Speaker B: I think most of the. I mean, every exchange is incorporated somewhere. It's an open question whether that somewhere is actually capable of enforcing laws in any meaningful capacity.
00:12:23.984 - 00:12:25.352, Speaker A: Like Malta or something.
00:12:25.488 - 00:13:23.256, Speaker B: Yeah, but everybody has at least some nominal jurisdiction where they're regulated. And, yeah, I won't speak to any exchange specifically there, but, yeah, I mean, you're taking on various degrees of risk, just like, depending on whether you're working with an offshore exchange, one that's onshore, their degree of credibility and, yeah, I mean, it's really just ends up being a case by case type of thing. I am really glad that we've normalized doing these proof of reserves type structures. Like I said, there's a lot of ways that it's not at all perfect, and you have very, very little visibility into the liability side. But it is nice to know that there's something there, and there's a lot of classes of exchange failures that would have just been entirely prevented by having something like this, like Quadrago or FTX. It would have been detected much sooner if they'd been publishing proofs of reserves. So I don't know.
00:13:23.256 - 00:13:35.754, Speaker B: It's obviously imperfect, and that's been kind of discussed at nauseam. But. But by and large, I think that's a very positive development that, you know, that's a lesson that we learned a little bit too late, but that's just how it be.
00:13:37.734 - 00:14:30.124, Speaker A: For sure. So one of the things you've brought up a few times now is everything costs gas to do on chain, and that's kind of an impediment to just having a working kind of financial instrument. So what's your view on how this plays out in the long term? Do you think the l two s, like arbitrum optimism base one of these figures out the gas is cheap enough and it's easier to do defi or do you think it goes off to one of these special purpose l one s, like aptos or psy or even Solana we brought up, which came up with the on chain order book one of the first ones in the form of serum. And they're always building on that front. How do you see thematically these different approaches to fixing that gas problem you brought up?
00:14:30.544 - 00:15:58.064, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, I think we are going to see a lot more adoption of these kind of hybrid Dexs, largely because they're not exactly subject to the same pressures that centralized exchanges are on the regulated on the regulatory front. And that's just going to push like especially people in jurisdictions where maybe a little bit harder to do business, haunt them otherwise. Yeah, like I said, I think it's just any system where it's hard to provide liquidity or hard to actually, you want to make it as cheap as possible to signal that you're willing to buy yourself at a given price and that costs money, even if it's a notional amount. I think that is bad. I think you look at that and then I think you look at the fact that it's just like on the majors, you're still taking custodial risk if you're trying to trade bitcoin anywhere under any of the designs. So, yeah, that's, to me obviously going to be on CFI ETH, prohibitively expensive to the extent that the liquidity is not on centralized exchanges, which it overwhelmingly is on centralized exchanges. But lets say the second biggest thing is going to be ETH L1, prohibitively offensive to actively trade on to a large expand.
00:15:58.064 - 00:16:30.250, Speaker B: So you now have this issue where you have to get the liquidity onto either another chain or onto an l two. L two s. I like l two s, by the way, but they just do create massive liquidity fragmentation. Theres no way around that. Youre siloing some assets onto a specialized side chain. Effectively thats going to lead to liquidity fragmentation. And so your largest concentrated pools of liquidity are just going to continue to be on l one or on c five.
00:16:30.250 - 00:17:05.874, Speaker B: And so I think were just going to continue to see a world where CeFi just leads all the major moves. You also have to consider that the Ethel one block time is very long. Yeah. So just by elimination, I think assuming eth continues to be the second biggest asset, assuming bitcoin continues to be the biggest asset, all the volume is going to still be on c five. I don't really see that changing. What I do think is really cool though, is on just the more long tail side, it's permissionless. And it's pretty sick that anybody can launch a liquidity pool and just start trading anything that they want to trade.
00:17:05.874 - 00:17:19.545, Speaker B: That's pretty cool to me. So partially a side effect of it just being permissionless. That's a necessary precondition. But also you've seen all the liquidity there accrue, like V two pools instead of V three. I think V three, there's just not. It just doesn't have a lot going for it. Right.
00:17:19.545 - 00:17:44.164, Speaker B: Because you need somebody making the market on it anyway, versus like v two has like the constant potential market maker. And so I think more simple. Yeah, it's much simpler. So I think like on majors, you're going to see CFI dominate on, on just longer tail stuff, it's cffms. V three, I don't. Or at least at the point, to be honest.
00:17:44.864 - 00:18:08.362, Speaker A: Let's actually. Let's talk about that a bit, because I noticed that too, and I'm not really an expert on this stuff, but just generally it's more liquidity on v two. Yeah. V three has been out for a couple of years now, at least. And I always wondered, if this product is theoretically superior, then why aren't people using it? Your point is that it's optimizing for nobody. Talk to us a bit about that.
00:18:08.498 - 00:18:32.174, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that's actually a perfect way to put it. I think V three does have the best on chain liquidity on the large pairs. If you look at EQ SDC, best on chain liquidity, it's much, much, much smaller than anything in c five. A lot. But if you. There's advantages. You don't have to KYC for now at least.
00:18:32.174 - 00:19:03.042, Speaker B: You don't have to. You don't have to KYC. It's non custodial. You can keep it on your wallet. You don't have to deal with. Let's say we were talking about keeping your accounts funded, practically. Let's say you're trading bitcoin or ETH, and you take your money off of the exchange and something happens and you decide you want to trade that it's very likely that you're not going to be able to deposit back onto the exchange and still catch whatever move you're trying to catch.
00:19:03.042 - 00:19:04.734, Speaker B: You have to keep your accounts funded.
00:19:05.394 - 00:19:06.154, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:06.314 - 00:19:21.818, Speaker B: And so just because there's confirmation times and everything. And so, yeah, I don't know, V three can be useful for that because it's not custodial and you can just move in and out of the position you don't really care about. I'm a little fish. I don't impact the liquidity on V three at all. Right. Personally. Sure.
00:19:21.818 - 00:19:59.852, Speaker B: And so there's a use case there. And it is much, much, much more liquid than any of the V two or V two clones, but just long term, that's really the only thing it has going for it. And so yeah, even the Uniswap labs team, they're moving toward RFQ system and V four, which is much more customized and all of that. I don't really have a. I kind of just want to see how that one plays out. I don't really have a strong view on it. But broadly, I think that's to a certain extent just an admission that there's a lot of shortfalls with V three.
00:19:59.988 - 00:20:42.844, Speaker A: So I recently saw a tweet put up by Nicarder on, I guess it's payments volume settled by bitcoin versus stablecoins, something along those lines. And it told the story that it used to be bitcoin. We used to use it for everything. It used to be the base pair for a lot of coins on exchange too. And then after staples came out and became popular in the last few years, they basically just completely took over that use case for crypto, broadly. And now it's almost the question I want to lead with and start with is bitcoins utility simply just a story of value at this point? And we kind of that idea that it could be used to transfer and settle value, that ship has sailed and now stablecoins are doing that for us.
00:20:44.544 - 00:21:15.086, Speaker B: I think this is a bear market question. I'll start with that. I think every bear market, we're forced to look in the mirror and see what exactly are we doing? And a lot of people have waxed poetic on it. I'm not really sure right now. As far as I see it. This thing is interesting because it is an asset that has a price. I think a lot of the core value of bitcoin remains unchanged.
00:21:15.086 - 00:21:41.986, Speaker B: That is censorship resistant, can take it wherever you, wherever you go. You can use it to spend. Its not very good for that right now, but you can do that and nobody can tell you you can. And I think thats all still there. I think other people think that the fixed supply is really the be all, end all. I think that's very, very important. I think it's part of the core value prop of bitcoin.
00:21:41.986 - 00:21:53.214, Speaker B: And anything that gets rid of the fixed supply is no longer bitcoin. But I've always been less focused on that aspect of it compared to just the censorship resistance aspect.
00:21:53.874 - 00:21:54.642, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:54.818 - 00:22:15.012, Speaker B: And yeah, so I think that's that right. I think, like you said, it's a bit of a store value. It's not amazing for payments. Stablecoins, also for the record, are not amazing for payments today. They're just not accepted anywhere. You actually want to spend your money day to day. When you look at these transfer volumes, they're all like intra exchange transfers, mostly on drawn.
00:22:15.068 - 00:22:15.676, Speaker A: That's fair.
00:22:15.780 - 00:22:43.112, Speaker B: Mostly just people like, yeah, it's not people buying, it's not commerce in any sense. It's arbing out inefficiencies on something that is an asset that has a price and that you can, you know, buy and sell. So that's great. But it's not like, it's not part of the productive economy the way something like a visa is. So I don't know. Yeah, I like stables. They're custodial, though.
00:22:43.112 - 00:23:46.836, Speaker B: They're not censorship resistant. They are in this nice little legal treatment area at the moment where they are allowed to operate under a blacklist model instead of a whitelist model, which is what the traditional payment rails have to deal with. But theyre not a substitute for bitcoin on any of the stuff that I think makes bitcoin bitcoin. But what they are is they are much, much, much better as the currency that youre trading against in anything because they dont fluctuate so much and because the transfer takes a couple of seconds instead of, instead of ten to 30 to 60 minutes, depending on how many confirmations the exchange requires. So yeah, there's a lot of reasons to like stables. They are not a substitute for bitcoin. And I think even also, Paul, so far all the stables that are actually crypto backed like dai, have just really not gotten any usage at all.
00:23:46.836 - 00:23:53.884, Speaker B: Like, what people want is they want a dollar liability, which is interesting, but just different from bitcoin.
00:23:59.664 - 00:24:40.904, Speaker A: So before I ask the next question, I wanted to just paraphrase a tweet I saw from spreak. I don't know, it went sort of viral. Real world assets means all your money gone. If court says so, the Alphabet soup agency says so. On chain assets mean all your money gone. If you open the wrong PDF, you sign the wrong transaction, and then real world assets wrapped on chain means all your money is gone, if any of the above. It's almost like you're just getting the worst attributes of non custodial permissionless tokens and wrapping it up in this real world asset like stablecoins that can have restrictions on what you can do with them because they're subject to whatever jurisdiction they're issued in.
00:24:40.904 - 00:25:15.610, Speaker A: And so I think that's a great way to encapsulate some of the risk factors that you. Even though stables are dominating in terms of transfer volume and things like that, it can get rugged effectively at any time. And also you have all the other risk of sending it to the wrong address or losing your keys or whatever. I will say, just to preface all of that, they've been useful for me. I paid contractors and stables, and that's something I don't think I could have ever pulled off with just bitcoin and doing the price conversion and the price moving. So having that exist, it does feel like there is utility there. Um, granted, it's just, you know, no one accepts it.
00:25:15.610 - 00:25:21.650, Speaker A: You have to basically convince someone to accept it, and they need an off ramp. And so, yeah, if you're in the US, it's coinbase or something like that.
00:25:21.762 - 00:25:46.290, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I agree. I've also. I've also paid people in stables, but they're always, like, crypto people. Right? And I. I think the one time I've paid a non crypto person for anything in crypto that I can at least talk about on, I think I paid. I paid my. I paid for, like, a gym with it once, like, but.
00:25:46.290 - 00:25:48.202, Speaker B: Oh, that's it. You know, that's great.
00:25:48.378 - 00:25:48.874, Speaker A: There you go.
00:25:48.914 - 00:25:51.866, Speaker B: I think, by and large, most people just don't want anything to do with this.
00:25:51.890 - 00:25:52.570, Speaker A: They just.
00:25:52.722 - 00:25:59.214, Speaker B: They would prefer cash. Barring cash, they won't take credit card. Please leave.
00:26:01.714 - 00:26:03.654, Speaker A: And then crypto at the very crypto.
00:26:03.754 - 00:26:13.954, Speaker B: But it is borderless, and that's pretty nice. But I think that is, at least for stables, largely just an artifact of regulation rather than anything else.
00:26:15.694 - 00:26:49.096, Speaker A: The actual question I wanted to ask with all of that pretext is, what has been your thought on four chain bringing bitcoin, bridging it into ETH, so to speak, recently, there's now a metamask snap that lets you use bitcoin on metamask. I think that was put up by shapeshift recently. I've never personally seen this stuff take off, but at the same time, there's just so much money in bitcoin. There's so much, obviously, attention pointed towards it. Do you see any utility in bringing it over to this on chain defi side of the world?
00:26:49.280 - 00:27:12.628, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that would be awesome. But currently, I think all the liquidity is on WBTC, which is just, you know, like, bitco is pretty, pretty credit worthy as far as crypto companies go. They don't do a lot. They do some lending, which, you know, they're not. They're not just a custodian. So there is, you know, a little bit of risk there, as always, but just in the grand scheme of things, I think, like, they're. They're as clean as it gets.
00:27:12.628 - 00:27:42.944, Speaker B: Um, but it's custodial, right? And so it's like, there's isn't a huge difference between using WBTC and, like, just depositing your bitcoin with somebody you trust, um, and trading on there. So I will continue to say that CeFi is better on that side. If they can come up with a way to bridge it over in a meaningful way, I'd be all for that. And I think that would be awesome. I haven't done a ton of digging into any of the existing solutions, and like you said, none of them have really taken off yet.
00:27:44.364 - 00:28:12.644, Speaker A: Yeah. To me, it feels like part of it was a lack of tooling where let's just even go back to ordinals earlier this year, and I know they've fallen off a cliff a bit, but it seems like they're still sort of chugging along. There was like no wallet for the first month that you could use to interface and store these things. And so then the wallet came out. I forget what it's called. It starts with an x. I think it was a stacks wallet, and they adapted it to work with ordinals, and then people were able to use it easier.
00:28:12.644 - 00:28:33.964, Speaker A: So I don't know. The question is, like, to what extent does the bitcoin community almost shoot itself in the foot by not embracing innovations like ordinals, like developers building a wallet that looks like a metamask? Or is that kind of the whole point of it? And we shouldn't keep trying to force this thing in a direction that it was never designed to go.
00:28:34.744 - 00:28:50.590, Speaker B: I like ordinals. I like ordinals. I think that's cool. I think they're one of the most interesting things that's happened on bitcoin in a while. I think the tooling for bitcoin is pretty bad. Just day to day. It's really not great.
00:28:50.590 - 00:29:24.484, Speaker B: And I think if there are some cool ones that came out, like you said in the post ordinals world, there's actually a lot of cool stuff going on. Albie is pretty solid. I used a couple of the other tools there. They're cool, but they're all very, very new. And there just been years where there wasn't really a lot to do on bitcoin. So nobody built any of these tools and anything beyond a simple wallet, just custody and transfer and what have you and some lightning stuff. But to be honest, I don't really like lightning.
00:29:27.344 - 00:29:37.664, Speaker A: Well, let's actually talk about that, because Armstrong of Coinbase announced they're going to embrace lightning, whatever that means, they'll integrate it. What's your take on lightning? Why haven't you liked it?
00:29:39.284 - 00:30:34.862, Speaker B: I think any system where you are fragmenting liquidity, I'm going to take that as a big, big con. And I think so that definitely applies to l two s like I mentioned earlier, but it applies egregiously to lightning where you have to lock up the capital in a specific payment channel to actually do any transfers. And then there is this weird routing step where you have to actually be connected to the person on your payment channel graph. And it's just not a good solution on that front. It's much, much, much less smooth than a global network where anybody can transfer to anybody. Yeah. And you're locking up, you know, you're actually locking up the capital there.
00:30:34.862 - 00:31:02.698, Speaker B: And so that's not great. So I've generally not liked lightning that much. I think every lightning solution that has taken off has ultimately been custodial because running non custodial lightning is a massive pain. And I think that's not that good. Like, there was a tree of alpha tweet recently as well, where he uses. He was using blue wallet and had some. Had some bitcoin on the blue wallet, like lightning service and they shut it down and then there's no claims process.
00:31:02.698 - 00:31:19.882, Speaker B: It's a custodial product. Right. And so I think, like, I think just due to the liveness requirements and everything, like, people are going to continue to use custodial lightning. There's just. It's very difficult for non custodial lightning to take off. So I've generally not really liked it that much. The times that I've used it.
00:31:19.882 - 00:31:47.934, Speaker B: It's been great, by the way. Like, it's very fast, which is awesome. And maybe it has some use cases in intra exchange settlement. If Coinbase and Kraken have a lightning channel open and they can move bitcoin really fast between each other, that could be really cool. But generally, just as a normal person using normal stuff, I would much rather use practically anything else.
00:31:49.134 - 00:31:49.886, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:50.030 - 00:31:50.794, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:52.174 - 00:32:12.590, Speaker A: That makes sense. I mean, it does make sense for essential exchange to embrace it because they're connected to so many people. So then you're always sending money back and forth to them. I guess it makes sense. It does seem like I've heard about lightning for years at this point. It. Yeah, it hasn't really set the world on fire the way I think people touted it to be back in 2017.
00:32:12.590 - 00:32:13.442, Speaker A: 2018.
00:32:13.598 - 00:32:30.290, Speaker B: Yeah. They have to keep the capital locked up too, though, right? It's like if they have a channel open with you with a certain capacity, and even if you open it imbalanced and you deposit it, they can't reallocate that capital anywhere. So it's not really like.
00:32:30.362 - 00:32:31.334, Speaker A: That's a good point.
00:32:31.714 - 00:33:13.324, Speaker B: It's not really like. It's just very inefficient. It's just a very inefficient design. And so, yeah, like I said, I could see some usages for it, but then it's also like, everybody who uses it says this isn't good for large amounts of money, and it's hard to disagree with them because, again, because the liveness requirements there. So this is supposed to be simultaneously for pocket change. And also it's like, has to be worth it that you set up your own, your whole own monitoring stack for everything instead of just, like, using it. Yeah, instead of just using it.
00:33:15.504 - 00:33:20.720, Speaker A: I think I'm in the same boat. I like the elegance of just not thinking about all that stuff, the trade offs.
00:33:20.912 - 00:33:25.124, Speaker B: I do, too. And the only way to do that with lightning is just custodial solutions.
00:33:34.204 - 00:34:05.764, Speaker A: Well, let's go to this. We haven't really brought up anything on the front of just recent metas, things that are percolating in the crypto X, I guess we call it now. Obviously, Friendtech has had this really interesting story where a lot of hype, the hype died down to basically nothing. Then the hype just came right back up to surpass its original levels. I think the latest kind of meta in that game has been the three three. You know, you hold my keys, I hold your keys. We all make money together kind of thing.
00:34:05.764 - 00:34:08.844, Speaker A: What's been your reaction to friendtech so far?
00:34:10.864 - 00:34:27.785, Speaker B: I think it's pretty cool. I think it's like, you know, I think the bonding curve is steep. I think it's. I don't think it's. I don't think, like, I'll just say it outright. I don't think this is, like, the future of, like, social communication. I know I'm crazy for this one.
00:34:27.785 - 00:34:53.216, Speaker B: It's like, I think it's. I think it's cool. I think most people who are on there, on there to make money, which is fine and great, and that's why most of us are here. I also think most people who are on there are on there to make money through the drop that they're gonna do, which again is fine and great. And to a large, that's like why I'm on there. It's like you do that and like you said, like that. Really? The three three.
00:34:53.216 - 00:35:46.934, Speaker B: You hold my keys. I hold your keys is the solution if like, you and your boys are on there to airdrop farm. Like, so I'm like, you know, I'm glad that we as a group, like, reach that meta instead of just like something else. But yeah, I mean, like, I think it's going to look a lot the same way that a lot of other crypto products look. And, and again, I don't think this super strongly. It could be sticky, but generally just what we've seen is products get a lot of usage and then they launch the token and then everybody dumps the token and they move on to the next thing. And we saw this with every l two that's come out and with a bunch of other stuff and with blur and what have you, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it's just like, that's just how the industry be.
00:35:46.934 - 00:35:57.674, Speaker B: So I don't know. I think it's cool. I think Redx cool, but, yeah. Is the future? Probably not. Is it a nice little token play? I don't know. I kind of like it.
00:35:58.734 - 00:36:00.674, Speaker A: It's fun. I mean, yeah, it's fun.
00:36:01.974 - 00:36:02.914, Speaker B: It's novel.
00:36:03.334 - 00:36:20.034, Speaker A: Well, it's funny because we tried half of it at least, with bit cloud. I mean, they weren't really the rooms, but everything else about it, it's largely the same. But it didn't work that time. Interestingly. That was a bull market. And now we're in a bear market and it works. Now is it because we're all bored? Is it because the chat rooms or really some crazy new primitive?
00:36:21.734 - 00:37:02.514, Speaker B: I think, yeah, I think this is like a, this is definitely like a bear market product. It's like the, you know, idle hands are the devil's playground kind of thing. But I think also just bit clout. Pissed a lot of people off because they just like signed people up without permission. And that was like a ridiculous decision. And I don't know why on earth they thought that would be a good idea, but just like Friendtech has been a much cleaner play generally on that side. And so I think, yeah, I guess when I say it's novel, it's novel, except for all the other that have been tried.
00:37:02.514 - 00:37:06.446, Speaker B: But it's the first time that we're seeing one that actually wins.
00:37:06.550 - 00:37:19.074, Speaker A: So that's kind of, yeah, it's still relevant months after. But you mentioned it might not be the future of social. Have you thought about that at all? What do you think that future could look like? Does crypto have a role to play in that at all?
00:37:19.234 - 00:37:21.138, Speaker B: I've thought about it very little thought about it.
00:37:21.146 - 00:37:21.694, Speaker A: Very.
00:37:22.354 - 00:38:03.878, Speaker B: Yeah, I think generally everything about, I think the core innovation with the Internet is making everything, and I stole this from somewhere. This isn't my idea. Right. It's just lowering the barriers to entry on everything, making information freely copyable. The cool thing about crypto and about bitcoin is that it kind of brings back scarcity to the digital world, and it's really the only way to get scarcity on the Internet. But I just think social networks are much, they're much more about replicating information than they are about making it scarce. And so I don't.
00:38:03.878 - 00:38:09.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't really see crypto having a huge, huge role there, to be honest.
00:38:09.854 - 00:38:10.238, Speaker A: Sure.
00:38:10.286 - 00:38:11.354, Speaker B: But I could be wrong.
00:38:12.454 - 00:38:44.112, Speaker A: No, totally. I think the most interesting experiments that could point to a future where crypto has a role to play are the ones being run by x. They're going to put out a wallet soon. They're already doing creator payouts once you get past a certain threshold of engagement. And perhaps there's something there that can be applied and done more elegantly with crypto rails. But, yeah, it is a fundamental mismatch with social networks. It's all about expanding reach as much as possible.
00:38:44.112 - 00:39:15.814, Speaker A: Not, and this is an issue we actually had with nfts, and it's a topic I wanted to touch on as well. Those came out. It's all about ten k pfps and exclusionary by nature. That whole market has just fallen off an absolute cliff. And in fact, friendtech flipped the entire, I think, NFT volume, like, trading volume for a few days ago. Just crazy to think one app could do that. I mean, have your thoughts on nfts changed recently? Are you still bullish long term? They'll probably change a lot, I think, next cycle, though.
00:39:15.974 - 00:39:39.460, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I still like nfts. I think, like, I don't really, like, own any of the blue trip collections at all. Um, sure. Because I'm, you know, poor, but, uh, no kidding. Um, no, I. I just, uh, I don't really own any of the blue trip collections. But I think, like, as a, as a, as a concept, I think they're like, they're pretty cool.
00:39:39.460 - 00:40:15.914, Speaker B: Um, I think you. We've kind of seen like, yeah, like you said, like, they've taken the bear market pretty hard. Some. Some collections have done better than others, though. Um, I was talking to somebody a while back and he was saying, just like, one of the, one of the best things you can do for actually protecting price during a bear market is to get the fud out early and take the fud during the bull market. And so a lot of the collections that maybe underperform during the bull, they're doing a much better job weathering the bear market.
00:40:16.414 - 00:40:18.754, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:40:19.114 - 00:40:49.626, Speaker B: Uh, different ways to slice that, but, uh, yeah, I still, I still think LMG's are cool. I think, like, generally they're really good as a vanity display. I like, I like bfps for that reason. I think it's like people do like status symbols. And, and so I like that play in terms of gating. I don't, I just, I think, I don't see why you would really want that run by anyone except for like a centralized admin, to be honest. But, you know, I could be wrong there.
00:40:49.626 - 00:41:06.454, Speaker B: But just generally, I like NFTs as status symbols, I guess, is what I'm trying to say here. And I like them as like, membership in an informal organization. But in terms of using it as just like a ticketing object, I don't know, could be the future.
00:41:07.554 - 00:41:43.504, Speaker A: That's fair. I think it's a good point you bring up where if I can get into a club by just buying my way in with an NFT, then it's not a club I want to be a part of. And I'm kind of combining that with some old quote about clubs from like 100 years ago. But yeah, I think gating mechanisms are a bit of an interesting use case for them that I'm not sure translates super well to just putting it on chain and having a market for it that anyone can tap into. So tell me a bit about what's been top of mind for you these days. What are you focusing on? What's exciting to you, if anything?
00:41:43.844 - 00:42:57.432, Speaker B: What's exciting to me? Like I said, I think the market hangs on binance, which you and I, as plebs, have very little visibility into, and on the ETF, which you and I have very little visibility into. So I think it's largely just about positioning that you're okay, whatever happens there. And, yeah, so I think following the ETF news pretty closely, I was following grayscale really closely before that and a lot of the other legal catalysts. I think generally in this market, what we've seen is that we'll break to the upside on positive news and then we'll just slowly bleed between news events. And so you just have to be positioned to catch the uptrends because those are the upswings, because those are, you know, much easier to trade than anything in a vaguely flat to down market. And yeah, I'm also liking governance, so I think that's pretty interesting. And it's pretty interesting source of information, largely untapped.
00:42:57.432 - 00:43:51.514, Speaker B: We've seen a couple of governance driven moves like the stuff on MKR, so kind of just working on like ways to make that more easily digestible. Because I think that's really the core issue there with trading on any of this information, is that there's definitely value in a lot of the stuff that's posted. Sorry, not a lot in some of the stuff that's posted, but it's just so swamped out by so much of the junk and it's all scattered across these different governance forums. So yeah, just building some summarization tooling so that I can read through it and my gang can read through it. So we'll have more to talk about there in the next couple of weeks as well. But yeah, generally just building news trading tooling and working on catching things right after they happen.
00:43:53.374 - 00:44:16.850, Speaker A: No, that makes sense. It's a good point you bring up. I was hanging out in one of the, I guess, aggregators for Dao governance proposals, and I think you're right. Like, I, I find stuff surprising when I read them that I like, have never heard of in crypto, Twitter or anything like that. There's definitely a lot of signal in there. But to your point, kind of fanning through all of it, it's just so overwhelming. Like if you wanna.
00:44:16.850 - 00:44:26.640, Speaker A: If you're dow and you wanna, I don't know, buy a hoodie for your team. Like people are writing like ten page proposals to do that. Like there's just so much. No, they straight up massive amount of information.
00:44:26.752 - 00:44:49.656, Speaker B: They straight up look like they were written with like chat GPT, most of them. And then they have this like, again, most of them will have this little like summary or TLDR section at the end, which is two sentences which says the entire thing. Like that's. Yeah, like, yeah, no, it reminds me just like of like model un, right? Like it's such a lar. It's such a lar.
00:44:49.800 - 00:44:52.972, Speaker A: Oh yeah, but got to justify your existence.
00:44:53.128 - 00:45:00.384, Speaker B: Yeah, but I don't know, maybe we can make money trading on it. So we'll see.
00:45:01.284 - 00:45:17.980, Speaker A: Are you using on the tooling front? You're obviously ingesting some of this information as text are you using any sort of natural language processing frameworks to help parse out the signal or how are you thinking about that problem?
00:45:18.132 - 00:45:51.018, Speaker B: Yeah, I use, I use GPT pretty heavily in all of my pipelines. I write most of my own scrapers and my own tooling, but that's one that I kind of fall back onto a lot. It's good, it's nice. It's like, I'm not going to show AI as whatever, but it's cool. It kind of levels the playing field. You used to have a lot of money to get anything close to what we have now, practically free. You can make so many requests and it's like.
00:45:51.018 - 00:45:59.734, Speaker B: Doesn't even show up on your bill. It's pretty cool. I think it's a nice thing to have to be able to take advantage of.
00:46:00.274 - 00:46:12.002, Speaker A: The only cost though, is apparently the data center for OpenAI in Idaho is using a lot of water to cool these computers. So we're paying for it in whatever water reservoir is connected to that center.
00:46:12.098 - 00:46:13.214, Speaker B: Boiling the oceans.
00:46:13.694 - 00:46:14.798, Speaker A: Yeah. Literally.
00:46:14.846 - 00:46:48.698, Speaker B: Yeah, sounds about right. No, I believe it. Yeah. The one I'm running into right now is just like, the context windows are kind of a little bit prohibitive, but most stuff, like I said, most of the time on all these governance posts, it's just the tiny bit at the end is what matters anyway. And most stuff is pretty easily digestible on a one page basis. If it's a longer form document, are.
00:46:48.706 - 00:46:52.882, Speaker A: You having to fine tune it at all to understand crypto lingo or jargon?
00:46:53.058 - 00:47:13.684, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it doesn't work very well for significance and so I'm sure there is tuning stuff that you can do on there. I'm just a regex pleb on that side for the most part, so. But yeah, in terms of just like, actually like, summarization has kind of been the main thing that I've been leaning on it for. It's pretty solid there.
00:47:14.384 - 00:47:22.524, Speaker A: Well, I mean, we obviously covered a lot of stuff. What else is on your mind as we close out this little informal catch up sesh?
00:47:22.984 - 00:48:09.024, Speaker B: You know, I think this is going to be a fun six months just on the ETF side. Like, I'm like, fingers crossed. Knock on, buddy. If that happens, we'll see all bets are off. No, I think we'll still be in a bear market just because the rest of the world is still in a bear market, but we'll be in a slightly less depressing one, hopefully. Yeah, so that's where I'm at. Just kind of following that, sitting on my hands trying not to over trade and generally just also trying to build better tooling for me and the teams we work with at glass markets on liquidity and yeah, like I said, kind of building drinking the bear.
00:48:09.184 - 00:48:18.924, Speaker A: Yeah, that's always the move. It's when things are nice and quiet you can focus on the task at hand. There's no lambos around to chase so I totally respect that.
00:48:20.144 - 00:48:24.840, Speaker B: No, yeah. Saving up for a Porsche but we'll.
00:48:24.872 - 00:48:28.164, Speaker A: Save it on the way. The Porsche. Got it.
00:48:32.874 - 00:48:35.570, Speaker B: Well, yeah, thanks for having me on, Saul. Really appreciate it.
00:48:35.602 - 00:48:36.002, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:48:36.058 - 00:48:36.934, Speaker B: It has been fun.
00:48:37.994 - 00:48:47.130, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for jumping on, sharing your wisdom and yeah, let's do this again in like six months. Hopefully all your predictions come true and then we'll just do a victory lap.
00:48:47.242 - 00:48:51.454, Speaker B: Let's do it now. Hopefully. Hopefully I'm wrong and we do under amazing bull market.
00:48:53.414 - 00:48:54.354, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:48:54.974 - 00:48:56.034, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
00:48:56.814 - 00:48:57.934, Speaker A: Cool. Artie.
