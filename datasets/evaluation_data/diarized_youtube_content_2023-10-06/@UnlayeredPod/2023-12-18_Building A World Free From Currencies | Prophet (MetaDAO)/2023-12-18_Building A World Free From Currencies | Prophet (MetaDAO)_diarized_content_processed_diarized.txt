00:00:16.120 - 00:00:46.918, Speaker A: Welcome to unlayered. Today, Dave and I are speaking with profit. You can find him on Twitter etaprofit, where the second e is a three. So profit is the creator of the metadao. And the best way to describe that is an experiment in human coordination. If you go on our website, which is themetadao.org, comma, you'll see the description is the metadata is a new cybernetic institution managed by programs stored on the Solana blockchain.
00:00:46.918 - 00:01:13.254, Speaker A: In other words, managed by code. But instead of things like token voting or liquid democracies, which are concepts that have been exploited in other daos before, the metadata uses this different structure called a futur key. And that's something that we will talk about and get into throughout this interview. But before we do that, profit, how's it going? And how's the launch been so far with metadata?
00:01:14.354 - 00:01:48.274, Speaker B: It's going great. Yeah, the launch has been better than I expected. I expected, like ten people to show up and, like 40 people, or, well, 60 people showed up to the Dow and became members. And then 42 people actually traded in the feed target markets, which feels pretty cool. Like, 42 people is probably too many people to fit in an apartment. And that many people have now traded in a completely new governance mechanism, like a. A completely new kind of market.
00:01:48.274 - 00:01:50.662, Speaker B: So, yeah, pretty good.
00:01:50.838 - 00:02:22.064, Speaker A: That's awesome. I mean, it's always exciting to see your baby come out and getting good response in the market. I know some of your videos and tweets got some love from guys like Anatoly and things like that on Twitter. Just because it's such a cool concept. I think for some of our listeners, it would be useful to perhaps ease into the concept of a futurchy and just talk about governance in general. I think governance has been a big problem both inside and outside of crypto. I mean, I'm sure you thought deeply about this.
00:02:22.064 - 00:02:47.844, Speaker A: What do you think of different governance structures? Things like democracies are common in countries like the US, in daos and crypto specifically, you see a lot of, I guess, token voting mechanisms that emulate democracies to an extent and have their sets of issues. How did you kind of end up at this space where you think futurearchies are the way to go versus previous ways of governing?
00:02:50.464 - 00:03:51.208, Speaker B: Yeah, well, first, to preface my thinking in terms of which is best, I would just like to say that I think that governance is really, really, really important. Not just, like, in terms of feeling fairness or justice, but in terms of real economic reality. Like, if you look at the difference between countries that are poor, like Somalia, and countries that are rich, like most of Western Europe and the US and Canada, the main difference is institutions and governance. And so I feel like it's a really important problem and one that crypto is ideally would be the product of crypto. Right? Like new institutions like bitcoin is kind of this new institution and a lot of daos are trying to be these new institutions. And then when we come to specific governance strategies. So voting, I mean, yeah, so there's voting.
00:03:51.208 - 00:04:52.572, Speaker B: There's dictatorship, there's like within voting, there's voting of a small committee and then there's voting with large committees, like maybe even a hundred million people committee. In the case of a nation state democracy. And the main dictatorships actually have some benefits to them. So like most early stage startups are run as dictatorships where the founder is making every big decision. And the benefit of that is that if the dictator is well lined with the up organization, then they have perfect incentive compatibility. Like Jeff Bezos when he ran Amazon, every decision hes making in the interest of, okay, whats going to make Amazon better? Hes not thinking, ok, if this decision hurts Amazon but helps Jeff Bezos, Im going to do it. I mean, maybe he would, but because he owns so much of it, theres not that trade off that comes up a lot of the time.
00:04:52.572 - 00:06:10.588, Speaker B: Whereas in a large quorum democracy, such as the United States or such as in Western Europe, that's not the case. There are many situations where either the people who are governing, so the voters, or the people who are appointed by the voters have clear incentive miscompatibilities. So with voting, if you only own 1100,000,000th of, if you're only 1100,000,000th of the voting power, you have a very small incentive to research decisions and to actively engage, which is why you see empirically that democracies are actually not very good at representing the will of the people. Because even if people actually pick the people, the policies are ended up end up getting picked by the special interest groups. This is my opinion. This was a Princeton study. Empirically went through a bunch of different policies and looked at average, what the average person thought of them, and then looked at whether or not those policies were enacted.
00:06:10.588 - 00:07:12.364, Speaker B: And there's zero correlation. They found no or very almost statistically insignificant correlation between things that were like 10% of people supported a policy and 90% of people supported a policy. Either way, they would still, they still, there's no difference in terms of whether or not that policy would get enacted. And so voting has some serious issues, and most Daos today are voting. And so you can see the problems there, like, manifest again, where most of these Daos, I used to work in Ethereum, Defi Daos, and most of them are operated by the people on the ground, even if in name, the token voters are the ones in control. It's really the people who work for the DAO, like the quote, unquote, core contributors who make the core decisions. They're not really DAos.
00:07:12.364 - 00:07:21.484, Speaker B: And that's how I see pretty much governance today, in a more macro sense, and in a defi crypto sense as well.
00:07:23.344 - 00:08:12.124, Speaker A: Understood. I think oftentimes when we compare governance structures, it's sometimes useful to consider the trade offs, for instance, democracy, it's great in the sense that, I guess, it promotes freedom, equal rights, and maybe it's just not efficient for making decisions. And if those decisions get made, it's really hard to undo them. And entire groups of people can get overlooked. You look at things that are more authoritarian, or even monarchies, that centralization of power, to your point, like a startup CEO, leads to extremely efficient decision making and quick feedback loops. But maybe people abuse their power. Maybe personal freedoms and human rights are hurt in that process.
00:08:12.124 - 00:08:33.608, Speaker A: So how would you describe, like, in this kind of web of different governance structures that have existed throughout society, you know, democracies, republics, monarchies, even, like socialism. Like, where does this fit in this broader web, if it does, this concept of futurchy that you're alluding to, I.
00:08:33.656 - 00:09:20.368, Speaker B: Think the closest is Plato's philosopher kingdoms. So I think the metadao is a philosopher kingdom, where all the power is vested in what is hopefully an altruistic and smart person philosopher. Only that philosopher. Hence, not to be. That happens not to be human, as instead the market. So we want to give all power to someone that can make decisions in the interest of all of us. But the benefit, because the problem with philosopher kingdoms, and we actually had kind of philosopher kingdoms, like medieval Europe under the Roman Catholic Church, was kind of a philosopher kingdom, or tried to be.
00:09:20.368 - 00:09:49.674, Speaker B: The problem with that is that you get the philosophers, quote, unquote, not really acting like philosophers, or not really acting in the interests of the people, acting in the interests of themselves. And so because we have these great new things called blockchains, I think there should be. Well, yeah, the metadata is one attempt to use code and to try to create an algorithm that is like an altruistic philosopher, if that makes sense.
00:09:50.854 - 00:10:30.352, Speaker C: I love that. And as you say, from memory, Plato's philosophers, they were the sort of superhuman beings who would always be neutral arbiters of the truth. And I think crucially the problem was that if you ever had someone like that, they would never want to actually be in charge. I think that was sort of the conundrum of his philosophers kingdoms. And generally the people who want to be in charge are the ones who actually want to enrich themselves and skew the incentives to improve the standard of living. So I like the idea of using the credible neutrality of blockchains of code in order to become these neutral arbiters.
00:10:30.488 - 00:10:53.464, Speaker B: Yeah, and I don't even know how many really true philosophers there are. I guess it depends on your view of how humans operate. I tend to think that those are altruistic of us died out probably a few million years ago in human evolution. So the ones who remain are kind. We all have a little bit of greed in us and so it may just be that as well.
00:10:53.884 - 00:11:33.666, Speaker C: Is there a difference between so a country you're obviously accruing all of the resources, but then the people in charge are then supposed to try and give them to, you know, the subjects throughout the lands, but in businesses you're accruing resources to pay to the shareholders. So it just feels like it's a far more aligned system. Jeff Bezos is the largest shareholder of Amazon stock and therefore he wants to do everything in his power to improve the payout that goes to the shareholders. Whereas when you have governments, they're not really seeing the benefit. If you're giving everything to the poorest 20% in the country, they're not really getting the benefit of that. And so there's just this natural sort.
00:11:33.690 - 00:11:34.254, Speaker B: Of.
00:11:35.954 - 00:11:51.414, Speaker C: The incentives are skewed basically, and therefore they're probably more incentivized to try and get some of that money to go into their own pockets. Do you think there's a distinction between the two? And does that shape how we should think about designing governance systems?
00:11:52.434 - 00:13:09.982, Speaker B: I think there was a big difference between Jeff Bezos running Amazon and the government. But I dont think theres a big difference between appointed CEO who doesnt have a large stake in Amazon running Amazon, and a president running a country. Because in both of those cases you have someone who doesnt have appointed CEO's arent given 10% of the company and even 10% not be that great from an economic alignment perspective, but they're generally given like ten basis points of the company, sometimes less if it's a really large company. And so yeah, in my experience as well, I used to work in web two organizations. And I saw that they are kind of like big tech companies are run like little governments, where everyone's got their own, uh, different business units are kind of like these different feudal lords, uh, that each have their own interests and not always working in the interests of the broader world. Sometimes they are, uh. But, but yeah, early stage companies are like the perfect, like a startup is perfect from incentive alignment, because everyone really wants it to succeed.
00:13:09.982 - 00:13:18.904, Speaker B: And people aren't, uh, incentivized to think about how they can maximize the share of their pie. They're incentivized to think about how they can maximize the pie.
00:13:24.004 - 00:14:33.194, Speaker A: How does this structure scale? And you brought up web two companies where like, you're right, it's early in the easy days when everyone has substantial equity, for instance, for them to see how that could benefit them from an economic standpoint, to work really hard and have that company succeed. But once you get to a Google level where there's tens or hundreds of thousands of employees, I find that's where the inefficiencies creep in. And people get motivated by other things, whether it's just they want to have a high headcount, for instance. And so maybe even if that costs the company a lot of money, it allows them to gain status in the organization. And I guess my question is, when it comes to something like the metadao or futurarchy, it could work with 40 people, like those 40 people that showed up on the first day. But how do you preserve all of those benefits you're talking about with incentive alignment through markets as this thing scales to something much bigger? If it does, does it scale to tens or hundreds of thousands of people? Is that the goal there?
00:14:35.494 - 00:15:26.410, Speaker B: Yeah. Scale is a critical issue because if venture backed startups are already so incentive aligned, then there's really no point in building a really small institution that is incentive aligned, because you already have one. And so scale is really important. And I think even just like a base level, you can think of futurity as replacing the board of directors. And so in that sense, you get some benefits and you get possibly perfectly incentive aligned board of directors. But as you point out, Google, for example, is a large organization. And I don't know how much sway the board of directors has over, like something happening four levels down in the corporate tree.
00:15:26.410 - 00:16:28.894, Speaker B: And I have some ideas. So actually why it's called the metadata was the idea I came up with that made me want to pursue this, which is basically an idea that allows you to scale futarchy or possibly allows you to scale futarchy. If it works where you split up the organization into a bunch of what I call member Daos, and then every decision goes through the futarchic process where you're guaranteed. Essentially what you do is for every decision, you allow people to speculate on how its going to impact the market cap of all these individual member daos. And then you only do something if its net positive. So, for example, if a given decision would increase the value of business unit a by 10 million, but it would decrease the value of business unit b by 15 million, then it would be seen as net negative by the market and so it wouldnt execute. But if it were the inverse, where one is gaining 15 million and the other is losing ten, then it would execute.
00:16:28.894 - 00:16:41.454, Speaker B: We'll see how that plays out. I'm hopeful that it will scale, but frankly, I don't know. This is uncharted ground futarchy. And so we'll see.
00:16:42.474 - 00:17:02.062, Speaker C: Can we just get a bit more into the nitty gritty of it all? Where did Futaki come from and how is it set up? Have you changed the fund? Obviously, you're just talking about these metadata, but have you changed the fundamental processes of how this was originally envisaged to work? Has it been used elsewhere?
00:17:02.118 - 00:17:02.286, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:02.310 - 00:17:05.354, Speaker C: Can we just go into the history of it and how you're implementing it?
00:17:05.894 - 00:17:42.764, Speaker B: Sure. So Futurkey was invented in 2000 by an economist named Robin Hanson. So, yeah, 23 years now, and it hasn't really been tried. There was a. An l, one called amoveo that ran one decision or a couple decisions in a semi futuristic manner, but other than that, it hasn't really been tried. I would consider us the first dao ran by Futurkey. And the idea is essentially to have markets govern decisions.
00:17:42.764 - 00:18:28.874, Speaker B: I think the analogy that makes a click for people is imagine that a company is run as a futurkey, and imagine that the company is deciding whether or not to fire the CEO. So today, a board of director just takes a vote. But in a futurkey, the way it would work is the company's stock would split into two. You would have two markets for the company's stock, and one of them would be fire CEO stock, and one of them would be retained CEO stock, and then you would have some time period. So in our case right now, its ten days where you allow people to trade on those stocks independently. And then after the period expires, you look at the two markets and you look at their prices. And whichever the market values more is what you do.
00:18:28.874 - 00:19:28.854, Speaker B: So if the company is more valuable if you fire the CEO, then you fire the CEO. And if the company is more valuable if you retain the CEO, then you retain the CEO. And then once you do that, you revert the other markets which revert the market that didn't actually happen, which allows. What that essentially allows is it allows investors to place trades that only get executed if an event happens, or it allows them to, which allows them to speculate on what something would be worth if it were to happen, in this case, the decision. And then it actually uses that knowledge of what people are traded. It uses the knowledge of the conditional trades in order to actually make the decision. So its kind of a recursive process where people are betting on what it would be worth if it were to happen, and then their bets are being used to decide whether or not it does actually happen.
00:19:29.734 - 00:19:54.194, Speaker A: You mentioned you have some initial members of the metadao. What are some examples of actual proposals that are being put forth by the metadao? How are you guys, I guess, implementing this at such an early stage? What kinds of decisions are being put up to this betting markets mechanic sure.
00:19:54.574 - 00:20:51.494, Speaker B: The first proposal. Well, yeah, just for context, I view the metadao as an economic organization. It has a token, and I want its price to increase, but I dont want it to be like a meme coin. And so my goal is to increase the amount of discounted cash flows to the metadata. And so what weve started, the first proposal was to create an LST ride platform, which I know you had on the LSD or the marinade head of comms before, and he talked about the opportunity to build an LST bright platform. And so our idea was actually to go build that, and the proposal ended up passing like 42 people traded in the market. And the pass prices, the price of meta, if this proposal was to pass, I think the mid price was like $14 in the end, and the fail price was like $5.
00:20:51.494 - 00:21:41.024, Speaker B: So pretty big discrepancy. And so the proposal ended up passing, and the proposal transferred 1000 meta to me to kick off the process of building a LST platform, which was all automatic. It wasn't just like, this is a voting process, but then at the end of the day, it's people making this decision. No, was just an SVM instruction that was automatically executed by the program. And then while we were talking to Marinade, we're having to do some pivoting, basically in terms of how we're thinking about that. They want to develop their own internal solution, but they want us to help them design it. And so right now we're figuring that out.
00:21:41.024 - 00:22:29.370, Speaker B: That's the type of proposal that would be there. If you read the proposal, it's very corporate, I guess you could say it shows. What do we expect the total addressable market of this to be? How could we monetize it? And what percentage and what would be the projected cash flows that we could get out of this? And another proposal that I think will go live soon is to develop a UI for Openbook V two. They're going to possibly, probably pay us a grant to do that. And so, yeah, stuff like that. In the long term, I want to build, I want the metadata to be able to fund big projects, like cool projects. But right now we have no money and or very little.
00:22:29.370 - 00:22:50.634, Speaker B: This is a new organization, and we don't have any legitimacy other than just a few cool people in Solana retweeting us. And so the goal is to get to legitimacy as fast as possible. And then hopefully from there now, we'd be able to leverage that to either raise money or get more people excited and funnel that into building new and interesting projects.
00:22:51.254 - 00:23:25.014, Speaker C: Can we just put a spotlight on exactly what the. So you said $15 was the passing price basically, for this first proposal. So does that mean that all of the metadao tokens which were previously in existence, people are saying, if this proposal goes ahead, I now value all of them at $15. So that's first question. And then second question. Are people injecting additional funds into this to push that price up? Is everyone having to pay the same $15? Can you just sort of clarify a bit on that side of things?
00:23:25.594 - 00:23:50.238, Speaker B: Sure. That was the mid price at the end of the proposal. So that deviated quite a bit on the first day. Its not the same price for everyone. Theres an order book that ran through the whole period. Its based on open book V two. On the very first day, the bid was like a dollar and the ask was $7.90.
00:23:50.238 - 00:24:33.284, Speaker B: So we had a pretty widespread on meta tokens. And then over the first two days, they converged. And yes, youre paying with USDC. The way it works is you would take USDC and you put that into the market. And so what you do is you take USDC. So say I take five USDC and then I mint conditional USDC, and that gives me back, if I have five USDC, it would give me back five conditional and pass USDC, and five conditional and fail USDC, which just like that's USDC, I get back in those conditions. So if I just mint and I don't do anything else, then I've, that's a net zero transaction.
00:24:33.284 - 00:25:29.204, Speaker B: If it fails, I'll be able to redeem my conditional on fail USDC, and if it passes, I'll be able to redeem my conditional on pass USDC. Now, if I want to speculate that this proposal will be valuable or will accrue value to the meta token, then what I would do is I would take my conditional on pass USDC and trade it for conditional on pass meta, and then if it passes, I can redeem that conditional and pass meta for real meta. And I've kind of like front run the decision. Or if it fails, I can go back and redeem my conditional and fail USDC for canonical or real USDC. And yeah, so the actual prices is the dollar. 14 I was mentioning is the price of conditional on pass meta quoted in conditional and pass USDC. And so it's like, yeah, what would this be worth if it were to pass?
00:25:34.744 - 00:26:50.604, Speaker A: Let's talk about potential downsides. So I think, let me preface by saying I think this mechanism is very cool and it's an experiment that needs to happen, and there's a lot of promise. Let's talk about perhaps what happens when you turn every decision into essentially a betting market. How do you think about market manipulation, the influence of, if this continues to succeed and people start making money and potentially joining the Dow as well, the influence of wealthier market participants, if that's a consideration, or if you already have a mechanism to deal with that, or just maybe even the main criticism, I think, which is kind of hard to guard against, is you shift focus when you turn things into, as you're saying, if decision a passes, this is the value of the token versus decision b. What if the decision has such a long time horizon, for instance, SpaceX, let's build a rocket. It's just going to hemorrhage money for years, and then it's a moonshot on year ten you launched, it becomes a valuable company. Like, how do you think about some of these downsides of turning things into markets when you're making decisions?
00:26:52.464 - 00:27:49.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the main drawback is this thing called keynesian beauty contests, which I'll get into, but before I get into that, I'll just say the goal that we're trying to achieve is not to build some, like the platonically ideal governance system. The goal is just to beat what currently exists. And if you look at markets, they've been compared against existing systems a few times, empirically. So, like, for example, with presidential elections, there have been researchers that have gone through and looked at pollsters predictions on who's going to win the election and then the prediction markets prediction on who's going to win the election. And empirically, prediction markets are better. In 1980, when the challenger space shuttle blew up, it took the government two to four months to figure out that it was Morton Thiokol's o rings that caused the crash. But the market had priced it into Morton Thiokol's shares.
00:27:49.838 - 00:28:38.124, Speaker B: Within 14 minutes, Morton Thiokol's shares have fallen much below the other government contractors. So when it comes to pricing the future like SpaceX, I think that one is that just maybe a fault in humans, we are not good at pricing the future. And so that's what makes markets not good at pricing the future. Now, there is a pretty. There is a very big problem, or we'll see how big a problem it is, which is keynesian beauty contest, where in markets, a lot of the times, especially in crypto, people don't buy things because they think they're intrinsically valuable. They buy them because they think another person is going to buy them after them. So they try to, like, front run the other person's irrationality.
00:28:38.124 - 00:29:27.404, Speaker B: And that's a problem that you don't really have with voting. Like, I don't think that people vote for Person X because they want to front run another person voting on Person X. It doesn't really work like that. And so, yeah, I think that's the main problem. The main thing that we can do to address that is to make people feel like the marginal buyer is not irrational. So try to create a community that is full of rational people, which is why we don't really publish the discord in a bunch of places. And we try to keep the community tight knit because we want to.
00:29:27.404 - 00:29:37.904, Speaker B: We want people to feel like the other participants in the market are rational. But it will definitely be a problem, and I'm curious to see how it plays out.
00:29:38.804 - 00:30:25.594, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a difficult one, isn't it, to deal with that? Because I'm just thinking in my head, if someone proposed, let's Yolo half of the treasury into bonk, because bonk to 100 million, if you gave that to the market wide, certainly the Solana participants, I fear that you might get over 50%. Say, yes, let's do it. So, as you say, it's a really difficult one. But then your solution, it sounds like you're planning on keeping it to quite a small community. So again, maybe it comes back to Sal's question about does this scale? Because as I said, if every member of the islamic community was in this, they would maybe press the yes button to the bonk proposal.
00:30:26.214 - 00:31:14.190, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a serious concern in terms of that. I wake up in the middle of the night and I'm just scared that someone's going to turn this into a meme coin. And then suddenly the metadata is going to start voting on whether or not we should start funding the jamaican bobsled team with the treasury or something like that to increase the memetic value or something. I really, really hope that doesn't happen. But in terms of does this scale? I feel like it does. If you look at a lot of web, two Internet platforms, they started really small and tried to get the fire burning really bright and then gradually expanded from there. Yelp, for example, Jeremy Stoppelman started Yelp by handing out Yelp shirts and nightclubs in San Francisco.
00:31:14.190 - 00:32:08.298, Speaker B: If you look at Glassdoor, they started by interviewing people outside the. At the Starbucks, outside the Cisco headquarters with like a paper clipboard and just writing those reviews out and putting them into Glassdoor and discord. Obviously started with gaming, like small communities gaming, and now it's become this thing that's much broader. And so my goal is to get the fire burning really, really bright with a few people. And I think over time we can naturally scale from there. But my goal is just to get the core interaction unit, which is like people trading in these markets, really good. And then scale is, I don't view as like that hard a problem or it's not the key problem in a future because you don't necessarily even want many more market participants.
00:32:08.298 - 00:32:11.954, Speaker B: You just want the quality of the market participants to be very high.
00:32:12.654 - 00:32:49.134, Speaker C: Someone like curve, they ask the people proposing and voting on governance proposals, they ask them to lock the curve token for a period of up to four years to ensure that they are committed to the project. Is there a risk as well that people maybe from, say, there's an opposing Dao which wants metadata to die, grind it into the dust? What stops people from coming in and just pushing the decision to always the worst decision to try and bring about Meta Dao's downfall?
00:32:50.834 - 00:34:16.534, Speaker B: I think those manipulation essentially is what I categorize this as more broadly. And I think markets are actually pretty good, at least relative to voting. If you look at Vecrv, the curve system manipulation is actually encouraged, right? Like you have a bribe platform where people actually pay other people to vote a certain way in a market though, if you move the market price away from fair value, which obviously, like intrinsic value, is not perfect, like, markets are not always pricing things based on fair cash flows. But anyone who's worked around shradfy knows that it's actually pretty good at doing this. If someone buys a bunch of stock right now, a noise trader comes along, there's likely going to be a stat arm firm, a statistical arbitrage firm that comes in right after them within microseconds to offset their thing where they're betting on, okay, this person is pushed away from fair market value, so I'm going to push it back. And so there are market participants that actively look for manipulation, because a manipulation means that someone is trying to push it away from fair market value. And they use that as an opportunity to either short if someone is trying to buy a bunch, or to long if someone is shorting and trying to push the market lower.
00:34:16.534 - 00:34:45.514, Speaker B: And so it's not perfect. Obviously, AMC and GameStop and stuff like that does happen, but we see a lot of that. We don't see a lot of the 99.9% of the time when markets function well and relatively efficiently. And so, yeah, I think manipulation kind of gets resolved by just market participants looking for those opportunities.
00:34:46.654 - 00:35:20.834, Speaker A: Preston, what's been your. Have you read network stake by Balaji? What's been your kind of take on that view of the world? And it seems like this experiment with metadata kind of aligns pretty closely with that longer term thesis. It's said differently. Just like an online community that is built on some core principle, which in this case is a futarchy that can potentially replace components of society that we use today. I mean, what's your kind of your take on that book and everything like that?
00:35:22.174 - 00:35:47.184, Speaker B: Yeah, I like the network state concept. I really like the bulge you wrote about it, because now people view me as less crazy when I talk about what we're working on. Right. Kind of legitimizes the space. I'm really curious to see how it all plays out. I think there are a lot of network state projects that are trying to go after land first. Like Praxis is an example of them, and I really hope they do succeed.
00:35:47.184 - 00:36:39.144, Speaker B: My concern is what prevents them from going back. They are obviously started as this problem started as a solution to address the problem of how nation states have turned out, but what prevents them from going back into the same habits that led us here into the first place? And so that's why I'm personally excited about building governance first as opposed to land first. But yeah, I think we'll see how that plays out. It's still super early. I don't think there are any projects that currently have any land secured other than Liberlandia has a tiny little plot, but there's. Croatia doesn't even allow them to access it. So, yeah, I'm excited.
00:36:39.144 - 00:36:46.304, Speaker B: I have some concerns about what's going to prevent them from going back into the same habits.
00:36:47.084 - 00:37:54.854, Speaker A: Well, actually, you brought up a good point that I want to use as a springboard for the next question, which is a lot of these experiments we do, even just crypto currencies in general, start out ideologically sound, and then over time, we see actors basically revert back to the exact behaviors that we wanted to get away from. And for example, the idea of bitcoin being a check against money printing and a hedge against inflation, that works great. We inspired a bunch of cryptocurrencies and now entire companies in crypto. Let's take Olympus. Dow, for instance, is like the key example here. And all the Olympics forks from the last bull run, they just inflated everybody out of any wealth and just turned into a Ponzi scheme. And it's just kind of funny that we enable people to essentially print money with tokens and deceive the public into inflation schedules and remission schedules over time, which is exactly what the whole point of crypto was, to get away from abusing that aspect of currency issuance.
00:37:54.854 - 00:38:24.034, Speaker A: So I guess my question here is, it's like a double edged sword. We have these technological primitives that enable us to do really good things, but also abuse them and do really bad things at massive scale. What's your view on just in the future, as you see projects like the metadata succeed potentially in that world? How are we coordinating across different organizations? How do you view currencies in general?
00:38:26.134 - 00:39:21.096, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin is great, isn't it? I feel like it's the only project that actually has stayed true to its ideological roots, which is essentially 21 billion, and don't screw anything up, don't change anything about the protocol, and that's actually what they've done. So that's kind of cool. But, yeah, it's your point. A lot of like, look at they. What's going on in Ethereum with Lido right now, where now you could say that they are kind of centralized, maybe more than we'd like them to be. And I think the core problem with all that is governance, because that's the problem that hasn't been solved yet, is we all these systems like web3 for example, is pitched just this idea where you have the users govern the protocol. What does that actually mean today, token voting, which is similar to what we had before.
00:39:21.096 - 00:39:59.384, Speaker B: I guess now you called them the community instead of calling them the shareholders for whatever reason. But it's not like you've unlocked some new insight. The other cool projects are like Rye on Ethereum, where they don't have a governance structure that governs over arbitrary decisions, but they just govern over interest rates. And it's completely algorithmic. They just use a pid controller that's embedded in a smart contract. And so that way they can also be guaranteed that they are ideologically pure. Like stay with what the root of the project is.
00:39:59.384 - 00:40:16.164, Speaker B: But yeah, I think the core problem with all this crypto stuff of like returning to the old ways is governance. Right. It feels like that's kind of what we're lacking today. And I hope that if we don't figure it out, someone else does.
00:40:19.024 - 00:40:24.804, Speaker C: Can you see one day a presidential election being decided using food turkey?
00:40:25.384 - 00:40:28.376, Speaker B: Definitely 100%.
00:40:28.560 - 00:40:32.764, Speaker C: And that would be the whole globe basically participating in that election process.
00:40:33.444 - 00:40:35.108, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:40:35.156 - 00:41:07.444, Speaker C: It's super interesting because, yeah, all the heat that Facebook receives for ads paid for by Russia, you basically have to completely shift your whole mindset to envisage that as a way for future elections to be decided. But as you say, no answer is currently great. And you gave some great examples earlier of how trading can be more efficient than, than any other form. So yeah, I'm here for it.
00:41:08.664 - 00:41:22.376, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know how the normies if future, if you succeed, I wonder how the normies will perceive it. Because on one hand, yeah, you could say it's empirically better, but I don't think that normal people like the idea of decisions just being decided by trading. I don't know.
00:41:22.520 - 00:42:20.344, Speaker A: Right. I tend to agree there is like a human element to it that, yeah, it's unclear if it scales. Well. You've also had some takes on just currencies in general, like these primitives we have with smart contracts and tokens and dexs and aggregators mean that you can swap anything for anything pretty easily. And so then the question becomes, do we need like base currencies like the dollar? I know the dollar has been taking a lot of heat lately just based on what's happening with the debt and how much the government's spending and how unsustainable this seems in the long run. What are your views just on how different people or Daos or organizations on chain are transacting with one another, are they using something like Sol or ETH even and that becomes the currency? Or do you have a different view?
00:42:21.484 - 00:42:54.962, Speaker B: Totally. And here I have a pretty non consensus view. And I was happy to see the other day that Paul from teleport, who I know you guys have had on before, also shares this view. He posted on Twitter. I was so happy, like, wow, there's someone else who believes this. That's amazing. I'm no longer completely alone, but the core idea that I have, and I've worked in DeFi for some time and so I kind of have some understanding of how the protons work, is that we won't need currencies anymore if crypto succeeds.
00:42:54.962 - 00:43:58.604, Speaker B: So the catchy phrase is, if crypto succeeds, cryptocurrencies will fail because what DeFi allows or specifically turing complete blockchains. So maybe not bitcoin but ethereum or Solana or got any of them allow is you can do instant swaps. So say I come into maybe Sal, you come into my shop and you want to buy something. Say I want to store my wealth and, I don't know, apple stock and you like to keep your, maybe your dj and so you like bonk. And so you could instantly swap from your bonk into my apple stock and then give me the apple stock, which is different than in a cash based world where you actually need to walk in with the same cash that I accept. You can't just walk in with, I don't know, pounds and then have some magic machine convert them into dollars or rupees or whatever. I accept.
00:43:58.604 - 00:44:48.540, Speaker B: But Defi actually provides this magic machine that allows you to swap from. That's a bad. And so if Defi succeeds, we don't really need a medium of exchange anymore. And then the other parts of money are, well yeah, if you open most standard economics textbooks, they'll say medium exchange, store value, unit of account. And I think that there are also alternatives that we have for both unit of account and sort of of value. So with store value, I mean you already have stocks and bonds, right? But stocks and bonds are volatile and you maybe dont want to, like people have emergency funds where they store three months or six months of expenses or whatnot, if they get laid off. And so you probably dont want to store that in stocks and bonds.
00:44:48.540 - 00:45:31.944, Speaker B: But what you could do there instead of money is to use commodities, futures. So lets just say you, let's just say you spend all your money on gas, which is a crazy situation. But I'll show in a second that it's going to be generalized. So you spend all your money on gas, then you can just buy oil futures. And that way, even if the price of gas rises, you aren't taking that risk. The profit from your futures position will offset the increased cost that you have to pay at the pump. And so for things that are non commoditizable, so like rent, in whatever city you live in, you can have synthetic commodities features as well.
00:45:31.944 - 00:46:31.920, Speaker B: So like parcel is, they don't use futures, but perps, but it's similar, it's a synthetic product. And you could basket these up. So like, if you are 30 something who lives in New York City, you could just hold a basket that tries to mimic the purchasing power, or like the purchasing, uh, goods of a 30 person year old in New York City. Uh, and everyone can pick their own basket. Uh, there will probably be some more common baskets than others, uh, but that would be better than currencies, because then everyone knows that it's like their expenses, it's like they've pre bought for the next three months, and so they don't have a risk that they get inflated, uh, or like the value of their currency decreases, uh, which happens. And then for so that's store value and medium of exchange. And then for unit of account, you could either use those commodity baskets and you don't even necessarily need to hold the commodity basket that's used as a unit of account.
00:46:31.920 - 00:47:19.760, Speaker B: So maybe France has like France commodity basket that tries to mimic the goods that a typical french person buys. But maybe only like 10% of people actually hold that. They all have their own specialized ones, but it still can be used as a unit of account where someone could put on their coffee shop, okay, one coffee is three of these commodity baskets. And then I can instantly swap into that and then give it to you, and then you can swap into whatever you want. Or you could use a decentralized unit account like ampleforth, which I think is a rebasing one, which I think is really cool. And those are not currencies, but they do provide a stable unit of account that would be better than money. Unit of account.
00:47:19.760 - 00:48:09.426, Speaker B: Because a big problem with money is lending. When you lend money, you don't know how much purchasing power you're going to get back because the amount you're getting back is in dollars. Normally, if it's international or whatever the local currency is, if it's local and you don't know how much that's going to be worth in terms of real goods. So a rebasing unit of account could actually be stable in purchasing power. And so you would know exactly as a lender how much purchasing power youre going to get back or as someone who borrows money. So how much purchasing power youre going to have to pay to service the debt. And so we now in DeFi have things that either get rid of the need issue, the need for a medium exchange, or are better than current unit of account and store value.
00:48:09.426 - 00:48:37.540, Speaker B: They're better than money at doing those things. And so, yeah, if you believe that people follow their incentives, it means that over time, currencies will become less important. If we adopt defi, which maybe we wouldn't adopt DeFi, but my point is just that if we do, then currencies will become less important. Dave is laughing.
00:48:37.692 - 00:49:03.224, Speaker C: I love it. I absolutely love it. I've never heard the commodities side of things. I'm sure Sal's got loads of questions. The first one I want to come in with is you say for the medium of exchange, I can't remember which asset you were talking about. Maybe meta token, Sal's got bonk and you want to exchange between the two. You say that with Defi you can just do that, but on Defi you are going through most likely Sol, maybe USDC, because that is the liquid pair with each of those smaller assets.
00:49:03.224 - 00:49:19.154, Speaker C: I don't quite buy that. You don't need that medium account unless you're imagining a world where every single tiny asset is paired and instantly transferable and there's a highly liquid pool between each other, which to me isn't how DeFi is currently set up today.
00:49:19.894 - 00:50:01.434, Speaker B: This is a great point today, how defi is set up is to go through mainly USDC or USDT as the pairs. But it actually doesn't have to be that way. So balancer pools, for example, can be multi asset. So you can imagine bonk would be paired against, I don't know, s and P 500. And then S and P 500 would be paired against Apple shares in these pools. And then you could swap through that, or you would swap through that and it wouldn't take any mental effort from your part. Jupiter or one inch or whatever aggregator on the front would just figure out that path and chain lightning, it would just automatically go through.
00:50:01.434 - 00:51:06.934, Speaker B: And then the other one was Bancor V two actually used an interesting mechanism where they, on ethereum you have to minimize gas. That's the thing that everyone is trying to do. And so in uniswap, when you do a swap through two pools, it costs these two extra gas, like s stores is what it's called in EVM opcodes. Essentially you have to transfer, like if I'm doing a swap from uni to a bat, it has to transfer the e from the Unipool to the bat pool. And they wanted to optimize a way that those two transfer, or those two s stores just for gas. And so what they ended up doing is by accident, inventing a ammunition system that works without a middle currency. And so it just has all the individual currencies and then they have their internal, just an internal ledger thing that keeps track of what things are priced at relative to each other.
00:51:06.934 - 00:51:37.420, Speaker B: But yeah, today it's all based on currency pairs. The bet would be that if currencies become less important, then will probably want to start shifting away from this. People dont want to create currency, people arent going to want to trade stocks in bonk. If us dollars start depreciating and start being seen as more of a shitcoin, then well probably start wanting to move away from that. There are mechanisms for us to do that.
00:51:37.452 - 00:52:45.514, Speaker A: Preston, what was your response? I dont know if you saw this on x recently, but Brian Armstrong put out a post about how he thinks basically that crypto is not going to replace the dollar anytime soon, but rather serve as a check and balance that'll complement it and also just be the key, I guess, to extending western civilization, and that fiat and crypto can coexist for a long time. I think the best example of this is USDC, where maybe in 2016 or 17 everyone thought theyre going to be buying coffees with bitcoin, but really it seems like theyll just be doing it with dollars on blockchains, like circles doing with UCC or tether or what have you. Now you brought up Ampleforth, which I guess is a non dollar denominated flat coin or number of stay flat technology. But regardless, what do you think of Brian's thesis? Because it does seem in some ways to be almost a complete opposite view of what you're taking.
00:52:48.014 - 00:53:38.420, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is a pretty opposite view. And I think most of crypto is predicated on this opposite view that we will need other currencies like bitcoin. And yeah, I mean, I think that it may just not work out like we originally thought. I think it would be totally reasonable to think that bitcoin will be the alternative to the US dollar. And people weren't thinking when bitcoin was started in 2009 or whatever, about Defi. It didn't exist yet. But I think if you just look at the incentives, then there's a decent chance that bitcoin wouldn't actually be needed at all, and that instead we would just have no currencies.
00:53:38.420 - 00:54:54.214, Speaker B: And in terms of what the impact that would be on western civilization, I am a programmer, but I have done some waiting into that arena and I think moneylessness or bitcoin becoming a competitor to the US dollar could be good. Yeah, like I agree with him on that. If you look at european countries after World War Two, the UK returned to the gold standard and so like, kept its shored up its currency and then had a period of economic stagnation. France did the opposite, where they inflated their currency a bunch and had a period of economic growth. And then there were some other countries in the middle that kind of had middle results with economic growth. And economically, though, I think currency listeness would be even better, because economically, what causes recessions and depressions is people saving more than they spend. And this is the keynesian interpretation, at least if you read his stuff he talks about, yeah, if people save more, that's what creates the lack of demand in the economy.
00:54:54.214 - 00:55:30.400, Speaker B: And as long as wages can't reprice themselves quickly, which is like the stickiness of wages, then you create unemployment, which is like what happened in the Great Depression. And so if you don't have currencies, then you have to either spend or to invest the wealth that you have. And so we could potentially, if we move into this world, move into a place where recessions or depressions are not possible to have, because you cant save more than you spend or you invest. Trey.
00:55:30.552 - 00:56:21.654, Speaker A: Right. I think it gets at that other point that he was making in his post thread, which is depending on what currency youre denominating into, if its deflationary, it means the bar for lending is higher because people want the return to be better than holding the currency, which is, I guess, increasing in value over time, then the inverse is true. If it's really inflationary, where now the bar is a lot lower because holding it is making you poorer, essentially. And perhaps that's the mindset that people are getting into these days. But. Awesome. We've covered a lot of topics here today, and something that I don't think we've ever done in an episode, which is just opining on this future governance structure and how crypto primitives actually make this possible to implement and experiment with.
00:56:21.654 - 00:56:35.294, Speaker A: So I guess a bit of a closing question is what are you looking forward to? What's kind of like the longer term vision here? What are you excited about? With the metadow that perhaps no one is focusing in on yet.
00:56:37.114 - 00:57:16.492, Speaker B: I'm excited about. I mean, I'm just excited about this becoming a legitimate thing. Because once this is making revenue, or if this is making revenue, I should say this is an experiment. It could totally fail. Thezarchy could not work or we could execute poorly. But if it does work, it would just be really, really cool to have an institution that is actually making revenue so that people see it as real, but works in a completely different way than existing institutions work. And I think that could be like, this really could be the use case that justifies crypto's existence.
00:57:16.492 - 00:57:53.274, Speaker B: I feel like if it works, because that is kind of what crypto is here to do, right? We don't, we don't build things. Like we don't build houses or we don't get people from a to b, and we don't produce food for people or widgets. All we do is build institutions. Like bitcoin is the most prominent example, but hopefully we build other institutions as well. That's all general purpose blockchains are for. It's exciting to me to be a part of a new one that could work, has a non zero chance of working. And yeah, I think I'm just really excited to see how this plays out.
00:57:53.854 - 00:58:25.254, Speaker A: We're equally excited, man. One of my biggest, I guess, pet peeves with crypto and DaO specifically is we keep assuming that democracies and direct voting are a good thing, when voter apathy and just all the problems of it actually get magnified when you turn that into a token and make it even more of a direct relationship. So we're super excited that you're experimenting and trying something different. That's the whole point. That's why we have this technology, is to experiment. So we appreciate your contributions and really excited to see what metadata grows into.
00:58:25.554 - 00:58:26.394, Speaker B: Yeah, me too.
