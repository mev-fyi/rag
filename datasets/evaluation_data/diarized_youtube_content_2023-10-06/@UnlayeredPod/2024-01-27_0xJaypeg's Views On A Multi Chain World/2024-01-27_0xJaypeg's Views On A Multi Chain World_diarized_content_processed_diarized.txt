00:00:13.680 - 00:00:46.534, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered. I'm your host Saul alongside my co host Dave. And today we are jamming with Jay. He's known as Xerox jpeg on Twitter and prior to his recent rise, I would say as one of the more, I guess, active accounts on Twitter, talking about everything both inside and outside of Seoul. He has a very technical background, spent close to a decade as a software engineer focusing on the backend and distributed system side, and I'll let him fill in the blanks if I'm missing anything. But Jay, it's awesome to have you on board today.
00:00:47.994 - 00:01:19.484, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. It's a pleasure. Glad to have the opportunity to speak with you guys. I mean, thanks for the introduction. Not much more to add to that. I think in addition have been some develop some dev work in the NFT space, particularly just writing the smart contracts for primary distribution, both on the slot side and ethereum side. Still work as a software engineer for my day job, and I pretty much spent most of my free time doing all things crypto related.
00:01:20.224 - 00:02:08.848, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I feel like you, when we were talking earlier, you had been a part of Ethereum in 2017, kind of played around with the ETH ecosystem, maybe stepped away a bit during the bear, came back in the 2021 bull market, got really involved in nfts, started to see these other high performance chains come about. Give us kind of your zoomed out view on how you see these ecosystems playing out. I think right now a lot of people are, I wouldn't say bearish, but I've never seen so much negative sentiment around ETH since being in crypto. And I've seen so much positive sentiment around Solana since being in crypto. And so give us a temperature check. I mean, is this the right way to think about it? Are we missing something about ETH or are you truly bullish? These high throughput chains like Solana?
00:02:09.036 - 00:03:05.684, Speaker B: I think in the short term, the high throughput chains definitely do well. I think last cycle, and even in the bear market of 2022 and 2023, I think everyone's trying to front run the next narrative. And I think the thing that always happens is ethereum or activity just completely leaves. People are very bullish ethereum just because it's been around for a while in the past couple of years, there's been a lot of catalysts as far as the merge shanghai withdrawals enabled, and I think that works. And that narrative makes sense when there isn't as much activity but as you as activity comes back, whether that's a high NFT min, airdrops and so on. I think gas fee spike Ethereum pretty much becomes unusable. And then a lot of folks look for other chains that they can participate on.
00:03:05.684 - 00:04:34.254, Speaker B: I think that activity, or I guess the way I phrase it is that it's, we're front running that narrative in terms of, especially now, developers, not only users, but developers are also thinking, hey, if I'm building, how do I, how do I position myself so I can build on a chain that supports the next hundred k million users and their mainnet really just doesn't provide that capability. I do think with stuff in crypto, a lot of the times, price shifts much more aggressively than reality, and narrative kind of follows. And I think what happens is with a lot of these chains or these tokens, they don't really go away in terms of so long as there is activity, so long as there is liquidity on them, they'll survive. And so long as they survive, I think they'll refine narrative as price follows or as innovation follows. So I think, for example, with Ethereum nowadays, I think restaking and then the Ethereum ETF is the next hotel narrative that comes into play. And I think that's something that we'll see continually pop up as time, time goes.
00:04:36.474 - 00:05:26.964, Speaker A: On the ETH side, is there anything. So I totally get those tailwinds. I think the ETF thing, it makes sense, as well as restaking tokens, whether it's Eigen lair or any other one that pops up. But my question is, is there anything that ETH actually does better than Solana at this point? For the longest time it was just staying live. But I think even now, just with the, when airdrop, with Jupiter, just Solana shrugging off all of this activity, when it's a hot time for state contention and even doing more TPS than it did a year ago, it feels to me like we're kind of busting some of those myths around Solana going down with, with real data. And so, I mean, I have some thoughts on maybe what ETH as a community does better. But curious to hear your side of things.
00:05:27.824 - 00:06:23.586, Speaker B: I mean, I think the asset's just worth more right now, right? Like the market cap is higher. And I think then you can always point out, oh, if the asset is worth more, the tokens are worth more, if there's more economic security around it. And if I'm someone that's been in the space for a while, and I have nine figures, ten figures, and I want to store my wealth somewhere, I think there's a question of, hey, would I be comfortable storing on Solana, or would I be comfortable storing on Ethereum? And right now I don't think there's a clear answer as far as. Well, when I say clearance, I mean an objective answer on which one is better or which one's more secure. But if you look at the data, there's definitely wallets or more wallets that have nine figures, ten figures plus on Ethereum than there is on Solana. It's similar with bitcoin. Right.
00:06:23.586 - 00:06:44.736, Speaker B: In terms of the TPS, the settlement times for bitcoin are also not great, but there's definitely wallets and folks that are much more comfortable holding nine figures, ten figures of bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain than on Ethereum or Solana, because.
00:06:44.800 - 00:07:14.814, Speaker C: That'S what I was going to say. Doesn't it mean that they're really just trying to compete with bitcoin as being this secure place that you can store value? And if they're doing that, isn't it strong chance that they probably lose that battle? And therefore, doesn't this feed into this narrative that maybe ETH is in this middle ground between not being quite as good as bitcoin, as a store of value, not being as good as Solana, as an execution layer, and then it fails to find its niche? It's still really hard to actually pinpoint why ETH.
00:07:15.154 - 00:09:07.424, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. I wrote about this in December, actually, early December. I think the question in my head was, where is on the spectrum of smart contract platform, the store of value or medium of exchange, whatever you want to call it, where does Ethereum stand? It does really seem like it's in the middle, at least Ethereum l one is, I think that narrative worked before, when Solana was much more in its earlier days, where SVF was involved. I think it worked very well last cycle, but I think it seems like the ETH community or the ETH just ETH itself kind of got too greedy in that they pushed that ultrasound money narrative very hard to where they, in some ways, they bit off more than they could chew, in the sense of you can't really compete with the decentralization, the lendingist of bitcoin, but then also try to compete with the execution, the engineering of something like Solana. And I think they found at this point, they've bugged themselves into a tough spot where they really need to reshape the narrative as far as they definitely do some things, as I mentioned, like economic security, the value of the tokens, better than Solana. But I think there's some work there to reshape and market that narrative so that people are still excited about Ethereum as that as an asset. I think stuff like the ETF in terms of institutions really recognizing Ethereum will definitely be a tailwind in that process.
00:09:08.004 - 00:09:18.304, Speaker C: What do you think about this idea of ETH as an Internet bond? Do you think the yield meta, the yield narrative can, can bring in new investors?
00:09:19.084 - 00:10:17.872, Speaker B: I think there's definitely an appeal to it. I mean, tradfi, they love passive income yield and so on. But I think that with the burn, definitely is a very strong narrative. And I think it carries even more weight if they can, if institutions like fidelity or Blackrock will incorporate that in the ETF. And then I think the other factor around this is just where rates are. I mean, if rates are what, 5% currently, I think in a world where we have a couple of rate cuts, the Fed issues guidance where we're going to continue cutting rates, then that three or 4% becomes much more attractive. But even so, it's definitely feels more like a narrative than reality, given that this is an extremely volatile asset.
00:10:17.872 - 00:10:43.384, Speaker B: And on certain days, it moves 510 percent, which is more than the annual yield itself. But I would also emphasize that you really can't discount the narrative behind something like this. And as price moves up, everyone will flock to and look for any reason to explain why price moves up or down.
00:10:43.684 - 00:11:16.484, Speaker A: Trey, so tell us about whats interesting these days. You tweet about a lot of different projects, ecosystems. Its getting to the point, at least for me. Whereas I would say four or five months ago, when it was still a bit of a bear market, it was pretty easy to stay. I wouldnt say easy, but it was a lot easier to stay on top of whats happening, because there wasnt just as much activity. Now, things have ratcheted up significantly since then with the price movements. And so its getting to the point where one must decide what they want to really focus in on from a crypto standpoint.
00:11:16.484 - 00:11:21.564, Speaker A: Are you feeling that? And if so, what are you focusing in on these days?
00:11:23.264 - 00:12:25.624, Speaker B: Yeah, no, its a good point. I think as this space matures and as more, you know, builders, participants come in, there's definitely a broader spectrum of things in flux and development. I think for me personally, I really just go towards the areas that I'm interested in. I don't think I have a particular focus, maybe to my detriment. I think the core for me is just, how can I keep this interesting so that I stay engaged, I stay involved, and I don't over trade or I don't over optimize my actual core holdings. And I like to think that I play to my strengths in terms of a fairly technical background. I'm interested in strategy, so trying to do that more and more, as opposed to some of the other things like trading meme points and so on, although those are also interesting to look at.
00:12:25.624 - 00:12:42.964, Speaker B: I try to take a larger, like a higher level view on everything, try everything out, and try to be as open minded as I can, and just hope that it takes me somewhere to where I can keep doing these things, do more interesting things and uncover opportunities that wouldn't be there otherwise.
00:12:44.704 - 00:13:13.894, Speaker A: Gotcha. How about specifically zooming in on the NFT space? I mean, your handle is your X JPeg. You did a lot of work on that side of the stack historically. How do you think that evolves in this bull run as more retail comes into play? Are we going to move past this ten K PFP sort of meta? Is that here to stay? I think it's here to stay in some form, just because it's so simple. But at the same time you have to wonder what else are we going to do with these primitives?
00:13:16.474 - 00:14:11.944, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think the ten K PFP is, is here to stay. I do think it's similar to last cycle, although towards the end of last cycle it got really crazy. Really, it's just the top three to five collections that will benefit immensely. I think everything else is a weak beta to that, where there's definitely going to be some projects that do well, but largely it's the top projects that accrue value. I think something interesting that's come up though is I think it becomes more winner takes all because this was really the first bear market for nfTs. In terms of NFTs became a primitive last cycle, and then over the past year, 18 months, we definitely saw a large decline in activity.
00:14:11.944 - 00:15:30.118, Speaker B: And I think it's very telling in terms of, hey, what were the communities and what were the collections that stayed alive, stayed active? And I think we're starting to see something interesting that I pointed this out. But some of these token airdrops are targeting NFT community. So for example, like mad lads was they qualified for PIF a couple months before. And now with the recent Dimension airdrop, they also included mad labs, they included, I think, tensorians and puggies as well. But I think it's interesting because it's like, oh, these communities really went through a lot in terms of pudgies, had to take over mad lads minted during the middle of the bear market. So you almost want these community members who are dedicated, they're loyal, they're active during the depths of the bear to be. You want their attention, you want their eyes on whatever new project that is, whether it's dimension, whether that's pith, because that's the core of your community as far as people that you want involved.
00:15:30.118 - 00:16:15.894, Speaker B: I think the analogy I made in one of my tweets was it's kind of like the web3 or the crypto version of ad targeting. So if you're on Facebook or you're on Instagram and you're trying to your direct to consumer business, you want like the 18th to 34 or. I don't want to name specific demographics, but you want a specific demographic to target your ads to in a similar, similar way. These communities are perfect in the sense of they've been around for a while, they stuck through the bear. Most of them are extremely well connected. Building in this space or investing in this space and being able to drop to them is kind of this shortcut or equivalent of ad targeting.
00:16:16.714 - 00:17:04.374, Speaker A: Let me actually build on that analogy because I think a more, I want to say more apt, but a different way to think about it is if you could target people that are members of a specific social club or country club, and you know that they have some x amount of dollars, I think that is what the equivalent is in web3. It's hyper specific, right? It's capped membership. It's ten k or less. Usually it's unique. Holders are like five to eight k. Because you have a lot of whales holding a lot of these things. And so the question then becomes, is it useful for a business to be able to hyper target products and services to, let's say, a 7000 member social club with a minimum buy in of $20,000, and you can guarantee that they'll at least have this thing in their wallet that's also holding the NFT? I think the answer is yes.
00:17:04.374 - 00:17:19.294, Speaker A: At some level it gets a little messy, when in reality, most people have a lot of wallets and they don't want to connect the vault that's holding the NFT to the application. But in theory, it seems like a powerful primitive.
00:17:19.634 - 00:18:02.644, Speaker B: No, definitely. I think all of the interesting dynamics in crypto are reflexive. I think what happens here is it's like, okay, mad lads are already fairly valuable. You're going to drop an extra 510 grand, or however much to them. Now, more people want to buy mad lads because they want to qualify for airdrops, so it increases the value of mad lads. And then there's even a more powerful filter in terms of, okay, now Madlad is 20 grand, or however much it is, instead of five or ten grand what it was before, and now you have even stronger filter for that. And I think this is my thesis on, you know, the top three or five collections keep doing extremely well.
00:18:02.644 - 00:18:09.204, Speaker B: And I think through the bear, through the rest of the bull market. I mean this, this flywheel just keeps spinning.
00:18:14.564 - 00:19:25.106, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting as well, the point that you made that it's the first bear market we've really seen from nfts because I do think that probably the majority of the crypto ecosystem is slightly bearish on nfts and is it going to return and it's never going to be the same as it was last time because I think when you've had that flash in the pan and then it's all died of death the very first time, you're just never sure if it's going to come back, are you? Whereas if it's already done it a few times, we've had a couple of Lazarus experiences, people can get more behind. It will be fine, just like bitcoin. So yeah, I can definitely see second half of the bull market, a massive resurgence in nfTs, and im sure well look back at probably the prices today of some of them and just think, wow, that was the opportunity because its the underplayed moves which tend to be the most rewarding ones. Just moving conversation onto something which I found super interesting this week and I don't get to talk to anyone else about it outside of these interviews. So you're the first man up. But the Solana's token extensions, I don't know if you've had time to look more into those. Firstly, I'd just be really interested from someone with more of a technical background to get into.
00:19:25.106 - 00:19:43.714, Speaker C: Is it interesting, is this new, is this unique? Is this just emulating what we are seeing on the Ethereum side with the ERc 20s is the way that they're bringing it together under a unified SPL standard. Interesting and different. So, yeah, just any thoughts you have really on the new token extensions?
00:19:45.174 - 00:21:19.274, Speaker B: No, it's definitely interesting. I think just a broader point. I think Solana is a really interesting chain because they almost have this Barbell strategy where they target the degens, the shitcoins, the nfts, that side of the spectrum, and then you have the other side of the spectrum which is very enterprise, very corporate users very targeted towards web two or traditional tech or traditional finance businesses. And there's not as much in between. And I think in between really caters to ethereum, the decentralization, that sort of crowd. But I think token extensions really builds on the end of the spectrum that caters to businesses and enterprise. I think why it's interesting is because you basically provide an interface where you can customize the functionality of your tokens from adding additional privacy in terms of confidentiality around who, who is the sender, who is the receiver, how much they send to almost God mode like permissions where you can revoke a transaction even after it's settled to if this then that logic where it's like oh, we receive a transfer from these specific accounts, we'll forward a part of that to these other entities.
00:21:19.274 - 00:22:17.544, Speaker B: And that sort of logic is very useful with, I guess with businesses like Shopify or PayPal and Whatnot. And that's what a lot of their, I guess, custom logic or business logic is set up to do. I think even zooming out if we just talk about crypto in general, I think when people think of spinning up their own blockchains and creating their own token, I think it is, well, one part of it is to make it so that it's more scalable and they're not competing with other applications for block space, throughput and so on. But I think another part is so that they can create their own token standard. In terms of this is how things work, whether it's privacy, there's chains like Zcash, Monero and so on. And I think this almost.
00:22:19.684 - 00:22:20.284, Speaker A: The token.
00:22:20.324 - 00:23:42.514, Speaker B: Extensions is a big competitor for this. Because if we get to a world where fire answer comes out, some of the other scalability or reliability comes out, and you have token extensions well tested by a big enterprise user. If you're a business and you see this, and Solana has done a great job showing out the case studies and doing the sales to you, why would you go and try in the short term to spin up a modular blockchain or a custom solution when you can work with the Solana team to spin that interface of the token extensions into something that fits your use case? It almost feels like it's like a launchpad for traditional payments companies or folks that want to, or enterprises that want to delve into rwas. So in that sense it's extremely interesting. And if you've seen the video, it really reminds me of the different stripe products as far as advertising each of the different features as, as their own pillar and then emphasizing the composability or the customizability across all of them.
00:23:45.054 - 00:24:10.048, Speaker A: So on that point, what seems to be clear to me now that the announcements happened with token extensions is a lot of people would fudge Solana and say, look, the next blockchain will be just slightly faster than they'll capture market share and so on and so forth. It'll be just a speed war, essentially, because they could just implement parallelization and other things at the protocol level to make it faster. But now what's clear to me is.
00:24:10.056 - 00:24:11.536, Speaker B: That Solana just had such a head.
00:24:11.560 - 00:25:00.384, Speaker A: Start at this point. They now added all these features that no other parallelized blockchain that's fast has today. And they can essentially subsume entire chains that existed for specific reasons. For instance, evergreen subnets exist for KYC, will now transfer hooks, enable KYC verification ZK chains that focus on privacy. Okay, confidential transfers, you can turn that on and you can have some privacy guarantees and protect confidentiality of user accounts. And the list goes on in terms of delegation, enabling more interesting payments use cases. And so that even though it got a lot of hype when they announced it a few days ago, I still feel like no one is, people are still sleeping on it, to be honest.
00:25:00.384 - 00:25:27.558, Speaker A: That is insane. They're essentially subsuming multiple ecosystems that probably don't need to exist anymore. If you're a developer deciding what chain to use, why would you use any of that stuff when you could just do it all in this environment and pick and choose what pieces you want to add or subtract from your token, and then benefit from that global settlement layer of Solana Mainnet, benefit from the payments use cases, the little fees and everything like that. I mean, is that a fair way.
00:25:27.566 - 00:26:15.524, Speaker B: To look at it? No, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think the last piece that is missing is the case study where they partner with a big enterprise user. The enterprise user has a great experience, has all these good things, has metrics to show for it, and then I think after that it's a done deal. As far as why would you Shopify or Visa, which are two, two businesses that Solana is working closely with, if either of them adopt some of the token extension features, they have a good time with it, it runs smoothly. There's not much you can rebut in terms of why would we not use it? Shopovirus or Visa is having a good time on token extensions.
00:26:17.264 - 00:27:31.454, Speaker C: I like the point you make, Sal, that Solana is now able to really focus on these things about bringing enterprises in, bringing customers in making a customer first experience when Ethereum is still talking about scaling seven, eight years later and still hasn't really nailed that down, it really feels like the amount of ground that Solana could make up over the next two years or so, considering it was like one 30th the price of each a year ago. I mean, it's just astounding. So I think it's super exciting just picking up on one thing that Jay said. Larry Fink recently was talking about tokenizing the world, basically, and I think a lot of people were skeptical about why is he going to basically buy your bags and do it on a public blockchain. He'll just do it on his own blockchain, get the current elite to become validators. That's how things will be settled in the future. Do you think something like these token extensions, some of the functionality that they can allow, could bring more real world assets onto Solana? Or do you agree with this more pessimistic view of it's actually just going to be on enterprise permission chains?
00:27:34.594 - 00:29:14.594, Speaker B: I think that's a tough question in terms of this industry hasn't been along for that, around for that long. And really I think we have the ability to look out 612, maybe at most 18 months. But I think even at this point, I mean, I love Solana, but I think we're not at a point where we can support 10 million uniques or 100 million unique wallets on this blockchain today, and probably not for a little while. So I think in that sense, if I'm Larry Fink or if I'm one of these big asset managers, I'm thinking about what is a strategy that makes sense to where it's either very easy for me to integrate, test as a proof of concept? And then on the other hand, what is my plan for scaling this out so I can capture the Aum or the the metrics I need to justify pouring the resources and investment into this. And I think additionally, if I'm an enterprise or tech company looking to add a blockchain component, there's also the question of there is so much that changes that it's probably better to investigate, look into the space, maybe make some smaller investments. But the world of blockchains l one s will look completely different in 18 months, two years from now.
00:29:19.614 - 00:29:54.354, Speaker A: Let's talk about how you allocate. Do you have this barbell strategy where you're really into majors, bitcoin for instance, and then these chains like Solana, do you have exposure to ETH plus ecosystem bets like l two s, what would you be comfortable, what are you comfortable doing yourself? What would you be comfortable with new people that are into crypto looking into? Because they're going to have to make decisions. I don't see a world where we're all holding 30 governance tokens for l two s. How do you think about allocation?
00:29:56.194 - 00:31:11.722, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's weird because I came into the space in, I mean, I bought some Ethereum in 2017, but I really left and didn't really look at the space for three or four years after that. I came in towards the end of 2021, did my exploring on NFT, some of these altcoins meme coins as well, I think through the bear market, and I did a lot of reading, speaking to folks, listening to podcasts to see what some of the veterans have done. And I think the conclusion I came to was through the bear market, which was 2022 and 2023, or the first half of 2023. The smartest thing to do was to really focus on fundamentals. So what are things that are just going to be around that have, you know, some form of revenue or lasting power? And I really, I went deep on those as far as what are picks that I would actually be comfortable holding through the entirety of the cycle. And then that is the majority of my portfolio, and it's a mixture of spot and options.
00:31:11.722 - 00:32:07.864, Speaker B: So I do use some leverage with that as well. But then I think as we go deeper into the cycle, it makes sense to have part of your portfolio shifted out on the risk curve more and more, obviously in a responsible, safe way, but both from the perspective of, hey, there's more gains, the risk reward is better. But also, for me, from the perspective of, it's interesting, I can learn, at least interesting conversations I talk to people about. It strengthens relationships. So in that sense, it's not just the financial benefit for me, but also just keeps me entertained. Scratches of the itch, and it makes it easier for me to just hold my spot bags and not have to over optimize on that front.
00:32:09.524 - 00:32:55.324, Speaker A: But do you allocate into. Because I saw you recently commented on Twitter that block tower bought a million dollars of blur or something, which is I'm seeing this trend where assets like blur are getting bought up. Maybe that's because it has to do with blast and some farming mechanic there, maybe not. But my point is, do you think one of the best trades this cycle will be some of these more infra plays that I think is finally getting attention called to, which is that constant thing where investors will prop up these infra bets to really crazy ftvs and then retails the exit. Liquidity versus blur, for instance, is an application token. Tensor is going to be application token. Last cycle, Axie and Stepn were kind of the biggest winners for most people's portfolios.
00:32:55.324 - 00:33:11.714, Speaker A: How are you, like, what do you think is worth focusing your energy on? Because certainly the infra plays, they almost always kind of do well at the same time. I feel like the meteoric ones are always these application tokens, but again, they don't have a track record of getting bid up as much.
00:33:13.574 - 00:34:26.662, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it depends on your background as far as what you're. Do you have a technical background? Are you more aware of social trends, memes and so on? I think it really comes down to what can you hold through the cycle without feeling antsy if it runs up two x, three x in a short amount of time? Because at the end of the day, it's really. I don't want to call it the same trade because there's that play bastard horses in terms of some tokens will run a lot harder and a lot more aggressively than others, but at the end of the day, bitcoin is making the all time highs. Given its size, it's almost this vehicle to bring dollars into the system. And I guess inevitably those dollars are just going to keep moving out on the risk curve until the cycle ends, whether it's tax selling unlocks or whatnot. Grab all the liquidity. But yeah, I think it's really what you're most convicted in and most comfortable holding.
00:34:26.662 - 00:34:30.634, Speaker B: Even if we do a two to three x, it comes down 40 50%.
00:34:31.454 - 00:34:55.884, Speaker C: How do you get conviction on brand new tokens? Because often it's the new shiny things which tend to do really well, but obviously they're sort of the most unproven. So, I mean, we've recently had celestial, which obviously been an absolute tear dimension, will be coming out, Monad presumably coming out at some point in this cycle. How are you thinking about the new tokens? How are you trying to position for them? Jupiter, of course, next week?
00:34:56.224 - 00:36:08.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of it is. There's a lot of nuance in it. I think the way I think about it is what is the incentive structure such that this token will do well or not do well? I think we can talk about Celestia specifically. I think with Celestia there's this whole modular blockchain data availability thesis around it. I think for something like that, I think just on a high level, the more people that are staking celestia, the more validators, the more it scales. So it scales with it scales in correlation with more people staking, more people validating the network because of the data set, the technique they use for data sampling with data availability, I think with something like that, it was like, ok, the data availability only makes sense if there's other apps using this. If there's other apps using this, they're probably, they want to reward and incentivize current stakers in the sense of.
00:36:11.154 - 00:36:11.490, Speaker A: The.
00:36:11.522 - 00:37:14.360, Speaker B: More valuable this asset is worth, the more secure it is as well. Whether that's true or not, in terms of if we go deep in the technical aspect, I think doesn't matter as much, but I think that narrative is what is easy to understand and is more widespread. I think because of that, you definitely want to reward early stakers for providing or for validating network and providing some form of economic security. So because of that, I think Celestia has done extremely well. And then especially with the initial set of airdrops like dementia, alt and so on, this trend will continue. And then I think additionally, with a lot of these new coins, there's usually a block explorer or some metrics dashboard that you can go look at. That'll give you some temperature check around.
00:37:14.360 - 00:37:30.074, Speaker B: Hey, are people actually buying into this narrative or this thesis? I have, and that's very much the case for Celestia in terms of stakers up only, the mount. Staked up only, yeah.
00:37:32.134 - 00:37:58.144, Speaker C: Is it just this data availability sampling which feeds into needing more stakers to help it scale? I'm just wondering. So that's for DA, but I'm just wondering for dimension, which is an execution layer, do you think it's the same properties, do you think? Likewise, it's going to need more and more people to scale to make it a better execution layer, a more secure execution layer, and therefore, do you think that could be a good play when it launches?
00:37:59.164 - 00:38:29.214, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely need to dive deeper into the docs for a dimension, but I think that's the narrative that's the easiest to understand. Celestia for data availability dimension is the settlement layer for roll apps. That's with any narrative or any thesis. The shorter it is, if I can summarize in one or two sentences, the more it's going to catch on.
00:38:30.474 - 00:38:30.906, Speaker A: I think.
00:38:30.930 - 00:39:00.544, Speaker B: In addition, people love the pattern match. It's like if Celestia did well because people staked it and there's this whole three three. Celestia is the next ohm going on. The people that missed out on Celestia, which I'm sure there's a bunch are going to look at, hey, what's the next thing and how can I get a part of that right? And I think the dimension is definitely a very prime candidate for this.
00:39:00.844 - 00:39:21.644, Speaker A: One thing I want to circle back to. There's this weird phenomenon that I think you tweeted about, which is NBA players for some reason, like talking about crypto, we had the Dwight Howard thing. I think you flagged something with Joel Embiid. Dude, what's happening with that? Do you have any insights? Is this a top signal? I feel like it's too early for that. Right.
00:39:22.704 - 00:40:32.684, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting because this wasn't the first, like, I think 2017, we had a blow off top. Crypto was, people started talking about crypto and mainstream media, ethereum, bitcoin. But I think this past cycle in 2021 with NFTs, it became something that was beyond just tokens and I guess folks could just understand, especially with the doge and shib run up as well. So I think because of that, these more mainstream figures, celebrity figures, NBA players, rappers, artists, they're aware of this trend and it's very much how can they get some value out of their name, out of their brand, out of their following. Right. And yeah, I mean, I have noticed in terms of, I think Joel Embiid, yeah, he has the NFT profile picture. There's definitely a couple other NBA players that rock NFT related profile pictures.
00:40:32.684 - 00:41:00.664, Speaker B: So they're definitely early to the trend. But I think there's a question of how many people are actually, how much of a catalyst will this be for their audience. Their followers actually go look into this and make that jump into making a metamask or a phantom on ramping and participating. I don't think we're at that point yet where there's a high conversion rate.
00:41:01.444 - 00:41:46.144, Speaker A: Right. I have kind of two follow up lines of thought there. One is, now that we've seen what happened with win and Drake kind of doing that ig post of the hat and all the mania around it, it makes me wonder if meme coins might actually be the primitive that brings everyone on versus nfts. In some ways they're easier to understand. In other ways, the NFT has a picture, but then people don't really understand. There's cap supply and they're not super liquid and they're all different prices where it's like you just have this meme coin, it has a number, it goes up and it measures pop culture in a sense what do you think of that dichotomy? Do you think one supersedes the other, or do you really think there will be a reemergence of nfts that takes over retails mines?
00:41:47.624 - 00:43:03.824, Speaker B: No, I think the meme coins is ripe for the next run up with retail because I think in the past year or two years, the sports betting and the online gambling related platforms have gone a lot more sophisticated. A lot more sophisticated. The bets with the parlays, the different things that you can bet on, like when I, like a couple of years back, I knew what a parlay was, but they'd be very structured in terms of. So within the NBA, like some player gets 20 points, they win, this other player has five assists, or however many turnovers. But nowadays, some of these sites, you can bet on who makes the first free throw or who wins the jump ball, or who's the first player that fouls out and so on. And you can string along in this, this big parlay and have a ridiculous payoff. And obviously, it's manufactured in a purposeful way because I think stuff like that generates virality, and virality is a form of free marketing that ultimately brings more folks onto your platform.
00:43:03.824 - 00:44:30.774, Speaker B: So I think in that sense, I mean, I think the big bottleneck is the, the regulatory and compliance around meme coins. But if I was a sports betting platform, like if I was DraftKings or I was like bet 365, I would really, I mean, their strategy team is probably thinking, how can we get this meme coin trend or this activity onto our platform, right? Because there's friction to buying something like this or to participate. Because you need to go on Coinbase, you make an account, link your bank account, make a purchase, wait seven days or however many days for your funds to settle, send that Solana or Ethereum or whatever token to your wallet, get familiar with Jupyter or uniswap, and then make the swap itself. Whereas a lot of these folks that have the personalities or have, or are more likely to go participate, they're already on these betting platforms, whether it's something traditional like draftkings, or a more hidden version like Robin Hood or Webull and so on.
00:44:31.594 - 00:45:10.954, Speaker A: Nice. And one other point I wanted to touch on was, where do you think these top, because we keep bringing up this point of top collections, nfts reaping all of the rewards of the bull market. It's extraordinarily power law distributed. So do you think, for instance, like pudgies flips for apes, do you think there's some other collection, maybe on Solana, that's under the radar, that might end up a blue chip. I think it's fair to say in Solana at least, mad lads and tensorians are blue chips for sure. Maybe there's a third one that emerges out of the woodwork. How do you think about looking forward, who those top collections end up being?
00:45:11.854 - 00:46:25.804, Speaker B: I think right now, where we are in the cycle, I think you just buy the not financial advice, but I think buying the top collections are probably a good idea versus trying to find whatever may be the next winner or whatever might overtake some of the blue chip collections right now. But I think as the cycle progresses, you'll get to a point where the top collections are worth way too much and just aren't feasible for a new participant or someone that wasn't around in the bear market to go buy. I think at that point, that's when you do have some of these, let's call them underdogs, where there is a strong team behind them. They're also very motivated because they know, hey, there's a lot of liquidity in this market. There's a lot of demand for a hot project, and I think that's where you'll get something like, I guess an example is a zookees from last cycle. So they minted in, I want to say, January of 2022, but they flipped some of the more popular collections within like three or four months. I think they hit 30 ETH or something like that.
00:46:25.804 - 00:46:52.854, Speaker B: I think that makes sense because it was. I don't want to call it fair because there is the whole white list grind in terms of getting on the white list, if you know, the founders or whatever, but it was available for a lot of folks that half a ETH or one ETH. So I think later on in the cycle that the risk reward makes sense to go seek those out versus right now.
00:46:53.434 - 00:47:02.986, Speaker A: But you would buy bored ape over a pudgy like board. Apes are at 25, floor 25.88, puggies are 18. Like no one would have ever imagined.
00:47:03.130 - 00:47:11.898, Speaker B: Oh, no, no, let me clarify. I would not buy a 48 over the pudge. I think there's definitely some nuance here. Right. In terms of.
00:47:11.946 - 00:47:12.534, Speaker A: Right.
00:47:13.234 - 00:47:22.998, Speaker B: We're not just looking at the floor price. You've got to look at trajectory trend in terms of. And then obviously the fundamentals in terms of what is UCA labs doing versus what is Luca nets in the team doing.
00:47:23.046 - 00:47:53.568, Speaker A: Right. Right. Are you bullish, by the way? Like the other side? I know they're doing another test soon or something like that. It is an impressive game. Theoretically it could handle thousands of concurrence, proximity, voice chat potentially could make some noise out there. Are you bullish the roadmap or do you think it's going to be hard for them to recover after, you know, the bear market?
00:47:53.736 - 00:48:42.498, Speaker B: I actually haven't been paying too much attention to what board apes and you guys doing. I think they had an extraordinary run in 2021. I think the team is probably very wealthy. I think there's a lot of bank holders and I think with the blur farming, that's definitely left a stain in terms of guys like Machi or Franklin, who I don't want to say manipulate, but they've just almost wrecked that collection. So in that sense it's not great. Like it's definitely an uphill battle. Not to say they can't do it, but I think with something like, if you look at pudgies on the other hand, they were acquired by Luca the bear market.
00:48:42.498 - 00:49:04.854, Speaker B: Use his own capital. He's been on a tear in terms of building up their social media presence, the retail toys, the game and so on. So I think in that sense it's almost like senses make a lot more sense to bet on something like pudgies over for apes.
00:49:05.234 - 00:49:09.814, Speaker A: Bowl cut pudgies are worth almost as much as punks at the floor. It's wild to me.
00:49:12.194 - 00:49:54.184, Speaker C: Another topic which you were recently on another podcast talking about, but Coinbase. So I think at the bottom it looked to be around $35 and then at the top of 2023, at the very end it got up to 175. I think it actually outperformed Nvidia last year, which is absolutely mental. So I'd just be interested. Obviously at the moment they are listed as custodian for a load of the ETF's. Obviously theyre also sort of the onboarding platform for a large segment of the world, frankly. But im just wondering where do you see it maybe in ten years time? How do you see it growing its various verticals? How big can it become, do you think?
00:49:56.004 - 00:50:03.780, Speaker B: Ten years is hard to say. I mean, the crypto space has really only been around for 1314 years, so.
00:50:03.812 - 00:50:06.024, Speaker C: Its limited to five.
00:50:06.724 - 00:50:56.606, Speaker B: Yeah, beyond bitcoin, it hasn't really been around for a while. So definitely harder to say longer term. I think in the next two to three years I think Coinbase will be huge in terms of, I think the upper bound is some of the bulge bracket banks in the US. So I think Goldman and JP Morgan are valued at 300 400 billion, visa is valued at something like 400 billion. So I think that's their upper bound, really, in the next two to three years, maybe five years timeframe, depending on the external circumstances. I mean, they're really all in one business for crypto. And at this point, if you're in the US, you really have to go through them to do any activity.
00:50:56.606 - 00:51:14.934, Speaker B: Right. I think in that sense, if you're commanding the. The top of funnel, there's a lot of interesting things that you can do as a business to maintain that moat and strengthen it. And I think they're doing a great job at that.
00:51:15.514 - 00:51:35.954, Speaker C: Do you see some interesting plays which they can move into? Identity, I think was being mentioned quite a bit over the summer. Given that they have got KYC for about 100 million people. Do you see any other things? Are they going to become some sort of, I don't know, quasi crypto bank, some completely brand new institution?
00:51:37.094 - 00:51:38.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know.
00:51:38.342 - 00:51:41.914, Speaker C: Any interesting directions that you think that they could move into from here?
00:51:42.774 - 00:52:03.454, Speaker B: No, definitely. I think something interesting that I think flew under the radar is their base. Right. They built base. It's an l two. It's built on the op stack. They actually had a deal with optimism, where optimism, or they get, I think, 15% of optimism's total token supply.
00:52:03.454 - 00:53:32.904, Speaker B: Investing over six years in exchange for optimism gets either 2.5% or some percent of their sequencer fees or profit. So that's a really interesting exchange in terms of, if you read in between the lines, Coinbase for base, they can't issue a token because of compliance issues, legal issues, especially given where we are with the securities case against them from the SEC. But this basically allows them to issue a proxy token where they vest op tokens, both from the perspective of it's useful for governance, but also from the perspective of these op tokens are trading at what, $3 per token. And they're very valuable in aggregate. And then I also think as a sole custodian, they also have the surveillance sharing agreement with the SEC or some government institution to figure out what's going on in their order books and trading wise. And then, I guess, most of the trading volume in terms of the primary issuance, and then the redemption of the ETF shares are done at the end of the day on Coinbase prime.
00:53:32.904 - 00:54:18.794, Speaker B: And then I think the second order effect of this is that you now have fidelity. Black. Well, not fidelity, but BlackRock and some of these other big ETF issuers that basically stamped an okay or an approval for Coinbase. And this will lead to a lot of other opportunities for tradfi firms or tech companies that want to do something in the crypto space, in the sense that they'll go to Coinbase and they'll talk to the team at Coinbase, and that'll lead to, I'm sure, within this cycle, some really interesting opportunities and announcements will come out at that.
00:54:19.574 - 00:54:32.434, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Jay, we covered a ton of topics. Maybe a closing question for you here. Do you have any predictions for 2024? Anything that you're paying attention to or find exciting?
00:54:33.214 - 00:55:56.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think that the things I'm really looking at are the Solana equivalents on, or the equivalent of uniswap blur and so on on Solana, and how those metrics shape up against Solana versus Ethereum. And then I guess the extension is how the relative valuations shape out. So I think just to add more detail there with something like Ethereum, because gas prices are so high, users aren't as incentivized to transact frequently because you're paying $100 for a swap, whereas on Solana it's the opposite in the sense of it's like sub $0.01 for a swap. I'm going to transact as much as I can, or as much as I like to because it literally costs nothing, I think because of that, relative to the l one valuation, something like tensor or something like Jupiter or something like whatever the equivalent is, should be valued at more because they're generating more fees or more activity at the very least. So I think that's an interesting dynamic because a lot of people will benchmark the dex versus the Alt L1 versus the L1 against Ethereum.
00:55:56.664 - 00:56:05.384, Speaker B: But I think there's a discrepancy here because of the nuance on gas fees and more frequent transactions.
00:56:05.884 - 00:56:43.904, Speaker A: Right. I mean, we already saw it a bit with Jito where it almost exceeded, or it did exceed lido for a little bit after the token dropped. So I suspect we might see similar dynamics play out once tensor does this airdrop and these other protocols kind of have equivalents on Solana. The hardest one for me to value is the deck side, because Solana is weird, where everyone uses an aggregator by default as their quote unquote uniswap, whereas ETH, a lot of people don't necessarily, like, reach for one inch. But regardless, I do think Jupiter will do really well in terms of just having a high FTV. Um, and so, yeah, it'll be interesting and fun to watch that.
00:56:44.064 - 00:56:45.288, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
00:56:45.456 - 00:56:53.216, Speaker A: Well, awesome. Uh, it's been super fun chatting with you. Looking forward to seeing all your, your tweets and the timeline and appreciate you coming on and chatting today.
00:56:53.360 - 00:56:54.824, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. It was a lot of fun.
