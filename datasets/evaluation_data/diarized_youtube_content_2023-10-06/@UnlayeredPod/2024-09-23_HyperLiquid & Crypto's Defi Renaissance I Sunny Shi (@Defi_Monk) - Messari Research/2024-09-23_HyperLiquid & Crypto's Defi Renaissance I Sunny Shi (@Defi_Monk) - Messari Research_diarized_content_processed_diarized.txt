00:00:12.560 - 00:00:47.839, Speaker A: Welcome to unl, the show where we talk about next generation blockchains. I'm your host Dave and this week we're joined by Sonny Shi. Sunny is a previously a tradfi research analyst at a long only hedge fund and now works for Masari doing various research reports. And the reason actually we've got him on this week is because he's just done a recent report on Hyperliquid, the largest per decks in crypto. So firstly your background is more sort of on the tradfi front. So I mean John, talk a bit more about that and then how you've come over to crypto.
00:00:47.927 - 00:02:09.325, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I graduated in 2020 and you know, in college I basically knew immediately that I wanted to do something with the public markets. I just really liked how everything moved, you know, I liked the nature of the work. I was very interested in equities at the time and so, you know, basically interned at a local hedge fund in Boston, fairly small, doing a long only equity strap, Buffett style, quantity, quality, quality slash value oriented. Sorry about that, But I think 2020, 2021 or so a lot of people my age, that's when we really onboarded into crypto and similarly I think there was just so much going on and my friend had been sending me stuff, basically saying hey look, you need to look into what's happening here. And so I jumped right into defi, you know, skipped a bitcoin white paper, skipped the Ethereum white paper, went back and read them of course, but really got into it when things were probably peak crazy and just haven't stopped really thinking about crypto since. And so I think this year.
00:02:09.325 - 00:02:29.485, Speaker B: Masari had always been a research institution that I respected. It was the first newsletter I subscribed to. I was a big fan of what Selkis had done in the past and so it was a no brainer for me when they were hiring research analysts and I thought I should just take this leap now and it's been great so far.
00:02:30.065 - 00:02:50.641, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, congrats on getting the job. Just talking about the insanity of 2020, 2021. I mean I saw a video on my timeline earlier with crypto Bitlord. I think he was annoyed at having got liquidated again and he started setting fire to his apartment. I missed this at the time but I mean he's pouring petrol everywhere, setting fire to. I mean different times, different times.
00:02:50.641 - 00:02:53.065, Speaker A: I don't think we've seen the likes of this cycle. Unfortunately.
00:02:53.185 - 00:03:01.957, Speaker B: I would have loved to work at Masari back then. I mean things are Great now. But, yeah, I don't know if we'll ever get back to 2021 crypto mania.
00:03:02.038 - 00:03:24.277, Speaker A: Well, because I got in 2017, so I would have loved to have been in, maybe in that bear market afterwards when everyone had given up hope. And yet, if you're really paying attention, you could see all of defi platforms blossoming. Because also back then there's the existential crisis about what's crypto even good for? And I think it would be really helpful to be deep into the research, speaking to sort of titans of the industry.
00:03:24.381 - 00:03:53.399, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's sort of where we are now. I mean, not in the sense of crypto. I don't. I certainly think the uncertainty is less harsh. I think we've seen a couple of things that crypto has delivered fine product market fit. You know, there are certainly things that as a researcher, I can write about, but there certainly is a lot of, like, existentialism and nihilism happening on my timeline. I don't know if it's just me, but.
00:03:53.399 - 00:04:23.981, Speaker B: But yeah, maybe, maybe. I think that that's probably a good thing right now. I think the crypto community, you know, as users, I think people are just demanding more from projects. Um, and so I think the BS meter, the BS radar, is pretty high. Um, and I think as a result of that, we'll probably see some of the best applications come out this cycle or this year, or things that are brewing right now. Um, and hyperliquid, I think, is potentially one of them.
00:04:24.173 - 00:05:07.255, Speaker A: Actually did a good tweet recently about apps that you think have reached product market fit this cycle. And when you look down the list, you can sort of see why it's a bit nihilistic because you got hyperliquids, you've got pump fun, you've got trading bots, you've got Telegram mini apps which are just tapping the phone and earning points, which, you know, may or may not be worth anything. You know, it's a fairly dull list and it's not really going to drive the world forward. It's not really going to bring new entrants into crypto, and I think that's been a large part of it. There's not been this sort of grand futuristic thinking today. I think maybe deep end kind of feels like the strongest narrative this cycle for something which could actually draw new people in.
00:05:07.375 - 00:05:53.651, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if. Look, I think I. When I was coming up with that list, it was really just looking at anything that was either onboarding users at a rate that we haven't seen before or generating fees and activity in a way that we haven't seen from other applications that are new this cycle. I wasn't, I mean, obviously there are other things that have found product market fit. You know, bitcoin stable coins. I got a couple of cheeky replies saying that, but I was referring to things that were on their way potentially to finding product market fit. And look, I think if crypto is all about trading and swapping, I think there's value proposition there.
00:05:53.651 - 00:07:00.813, Speaker B: I mean, I, I think I put out a tweet recently. It was after the yen carry unwind situation when bitcoin touched to the low 50s. And you know, I think during that period, you know, just because I've, I've, I've been a little bit behind the curtains of, of, of how tradfi operates and people aren't not transacting. I mean the markets are closed, but people are buying and selling. OTC institutions are trading, they're offloading risk and you know, as the average user, you just didn't get access to that. And then when the markets opened on Monday, within a few hours, I think every single major brokerage was halted. And so if our PMF going forward, it's just centered around trading and swapping assets, doing it permissionlessly, doing it 24 7, trusting that the protocol that you're trading on isn't just going to halt or freeze your funds or stop during periods of high volatility.
00:07:00.813 - 00:07:37.065, Speaker B: I think that's, that's a great use case. I do want a little bit more. I think DePin certainly has that flashy tagline. And you know, Dylan Bain, one of my fellow fellow analysts here at Masari, super jazzed up about depend. Masari has always been very bullish on depend. But yeah, I think I've always liked to focus on defi just because I think there are plenty of applications here that could, you know, potentially present better alternatives than what we have in tradfi. And that's a pretty sizable market.
00:07:37.065 - 00:07:39.715, Speaker B: So that's where I've spent most of my time.
00:07:40.175 - 00:07:56.315, Speaker A: Do you think we need to bring on equity before that's actually going to sort of make a huge difference, a huge dent or. I don't know. Do you envisage maybe companies starting to launch on liquid tokens on the blockchain?
00:07:58.615 - 00:08:44.637, Speaker B: I don't think that will happen. I think there'll be derivatives that let you get exposure probably, but there's just a lot right now for that to come on chain. I am very, very bullish on the idea of it coming on chain, I think there are, you know, tons of people around the world. You know, I'm from New York, I'm from the States, and so here it's very easy to download Robinhood, set up a brokerage account with a Social Security number and just really buy anything that you want. Super easy to get access to the US dollar. But I think that that's just not true for the rest of the world. But I think actually bringing equities on chain, I'm not sure we can get there, at least in the near future.
00:08:44.637 - 00:09:06.495, Speaker B: But I would be very, very bullish on that happening if it did. But I think all sorts of derivatives, all sorts of perps, perpetual products certainly makes sense on chain. And we're seeing with Poly Market that there are other things that you can tokenize and trade and speculate on on chain that we don't have in the tradfi markets. And so I think there's a lot of.
00:09:06.615 - 00:09:24.217, Speaker A: How do you see the perps coming on chain? Do you think it, do you think it's in the form of fully decentralized, permissionless exchanges and they flout the US securities rules? Or do you think that we need regulation to change before we can see that sort of massive growth in defi?
00:09:24.321 - 00:10:07.575, Speaker B: It is very regulatory driven. I think it's very hard. I'm sure there are tons of institutions that would be happy to create some sort of product on chain where you can either, maybe you can, I'm sure BlackRock would love to allow people on chain to speculate on the S&P 500 index or the NASDAQ. Maybe you can even make that composable with the rest of defi. You know, maybe if I want to get a loan, I can host my tokenized S&P 500 shares as collateral. I mean, that would be, that would be crypto utopia. But certainly I think there's a lot of regulatory, a lot of regulatory boundaries presenting that from at the very moment.
00:10:07.575 - 00:10:10.775, Speaker B: But it's, it's, it's, it's definitely fun to think about.
00:10:10.935 - 00:10:39.205, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I often think that there is a chance that we're not going to see a sort of outrageous bull market until regulations start to move, move more in favor of crypto. And obviously it's good that we've got the very large super pack in support of crypto. So we'll see what the next, the next few years, the next presidency brings us. I suppose. So moving things over to hyperliquid, which is, as I said, the main Reason we wanted to bring you on for today's chat. So, I mean, high level.
00:10:39.205 - 00:10:52.227, Speaker A: Do you have any thoughts on why you think hyperliquid has been super successful this cycle? I think it has more trading volume than all the other perps combined. Combined. What is it about hyperliquid that has really drawn people to the app?
00:10:52.331 - 00:11:44.383, Speaker B: Well, I think there's hyperliquid, the product which for now, I mean their main product is just the perpsex and it's the best product in the space. You know, people who I know that trade perps frequently, I am not one of those people, but people that I know who do you know, I think a couple of them onboarded onto hyperliquid because of the ongoing points program. That's certainly been a factor. It would be probably false to say that it hasn't, but it's just a great experience and I've used it plenty of times now. It's my main venue for trading perps and that's a testament, I think, to what the team has built. Optimizing for the end user, optimizing for market makers. It's highly liquid, testament to the name.
00:11:44.383 - 00:12:44.945, Speaker B: But I think, I think if you just go back to when they launched, I mean it was probably small iterations here and there, you know, making it so that your wallet was connected frequently so you didn't have to sign for as many transactions, you know, shipping up products. Hyperps was something that they launched that let you basically speculate on tokens before tge, allowing for different order types. Just a bunch of small things that over time built up to a really, really solid UI ux. And when people were posting screenshots of hyperliquid orders, I didn't know where that was coming from. I thought it was some sort of centralized exchange, but I think it's just one of the best products in crypto. And trading purpose is certainly one of the few things that crypto is really known for. And so that's the first thing I think at this point.
00:12:44.945 - 00:13:45.993, Speaker B: What's, you know, the reason that I wrote the report and the reason why I've been so fixated on hyperliquid and I think why, you know, people on CT and others have started to take notice is it's really, really hard to describe to you what hyperliquid is today in one sentence or even a few sentences. I think the on Chain Binance moniker has kind of, kind of stuck, but there's, there's really no good comparison for it. You can't really put it into a box. Like, is it an alt layer 1? Is it just a perp decks? Is it some sort of parallelized evm? It's, it's really hard to understand what hyperliquid is becoming and I think it's, it's, it's fluid. So yeah, that's why I was initially intrigued. It was like, okay, what is going on? They have this HLP vault, they have perps fully on chain, they're launching a spot market, or the spot market is already live. Now third party protocols are talking about building on their layer one.
00:13:45.993 - 00:14:02.609, Speaker B: And so what even is this thing at this point? And I think that's incredibly bullish. I think when we can't pin down a specific narrative typically indicates that maybe you've got some sort of new primitive forming. And so I'm just really excited to see what happens from.
00:14:02.777 - 00:14:36.955, Speaker A: I always try to keep my feet on the ground when people start gushing about new primitives in crypto. So I try to maintain some healthy skepticism. But undoubtedly it is hugely, hugely popular and it's definitely done something right. You say in terms of comparisons, there's nothing completely obvious, but it seems to me something like dydx, which I believe hasn't launched yet. So that's probably why we can't make that comparison. But obviously they, they have left an Ethereum L2 when they weren't very scalable and moved to do their own Cosmos change. So they will be effectively an L1.
00:14:36.955 - 00:14:51.341, Speaker A: So do you think that DYDX has let the lead slip and is not going to be able to compete with Hyper Liquid? Do you think Hyper Liquid has done certain things, things in a more strategically intelligent way than them?
00:14:51.453 - 00:15:42.461, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's probably two things. The first is just the practical angle of why users are choosing hyperliquid, which is Hyperliquid has more liquidity, they have better user experience, they've got a strong community, the team has been shipping incredibly fast. I think if you look at when hyperliquid really started to onboard users and TVL and trading activity, you know, the other perp Dexs had kind of gotten stale at that point. I think there wasn't too much new happening. There wasn't really anything innovative happening. I think, you know, at the time you were also seeing points programs ending. DYDX was also shifting to this app chain, this Cosmos SDK and you know, people weren't sure exactly what that meant.
00:15:42.461 - 00:16:49.285, Speaker B: And so I think practically it's just this new product came along that was really, really easy to use, provided really really solid liquidity and had this strong community that was constantly advertising it on ct. And so I think that's a practical answer. I think more philosophically it's why do we want to build a perp decks that's fully on chain? Right. And you know, if I'm not mistaken, I think the OIDX today still uses a hybrid approach where the order book and matching engine are off chain. And you know, does that really add value in terms of what we can deliver on crypto through crypto Rails? And I think that users will still use uidx, you know, they're used to it. There's plenty of people I know who still use dydx. I think DYDX is a great project and certainly there's that aspect of being decentralized on chain.
00:16:49.285 - 00:17:47.753, Speaker B: It's easy to bridge assets on and off, you can use your wallet. But hyperliquid, I think by building everything from the ground up from the consensus, I mean they were on Tendermint as well for a while until they realized that it wasn't going to work for them. So building their own consensus algorithm, building a native bridge, building the entire order book on chain, I think it's something that's really, really hard to do. And I think it's philosophically speaking, the direction that perps, xs and exchanges in general will probably head towards which was, hey, you know, we can build a perpstax on chain and give you the best user experience on chain as well. Like it doesn't need to be a trade off, it just takes a lot of work. And so I think that that is something that I really admire about the direction hyperliquid has taken. And it's not new anymore.
00:17:47.753 - 00:18:00.555, Speaker B: I think there are plenty of. I think Drift, for example is also fully on chain and certainly there will be more fully on chain perpetuxes. But I think at the time it was really, really cool.
00:18:00.975 - 00:18:39.635, Speaker A: So let's tease more into this decentralization topic because it is one of the negatives that often gets touted to hyperliquid. I mean when you compare it to Drift, which I agree, I think is fully on chain. Obviously Drift is an application on Solana which has X hundred or X thousand nodes, validators, you know, sync sequencing, all the transactions. So it is a decentralized blockchain that it sits upon. Obviously this is an L1, so it's an entirely different beast. They're relying upon those validators and as I understand it, there's maybe four or five at the moment. All of them controlled by the team.
00:18:39.635 - 00:19:06.495, Speaker A: However, as you say there is an on chain order book and you can sort of see everything that is happening. It's all permissionless. So I suppose the question is what are the decentralization properties which are required for perkxes do you think in the end game and do you think hyperliquid has chosen the correct ones or do you think that they're losing out by not going a different route?
00:19:06.655 - 00:20:19.055, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I always find this conversation very strange and I think it's a testament to how well hyperliquid has done onboarding users and activity because and when people start calling for you to decentralize more it's usually a pretty good sign that you're at least somewhat of a reputable protocol that's that's doing something real. And so that's the first thing I think the second thing is what's, what's always been so strange about this debate for me is I mean you have your. I think crypto likes to say that decentralization is a spectrum, centralization is a spectrum, but a lot of people don't actually behave like it is. And so you have obviously your super centralized institution, your Robinhood that's selling order flow, that's halting your trading activity. Very, very evil. We all agree. And then it seems like on the other end it's like everything needs to be ethereum and I think there are plenty of ways that crypto can add value in between.
00:20:19.055 - 00:21:28.821, Speaker B: And so I think the first thing, let's just assume that at this point hyperliquid doesn't decentralize further. Which you know, it's been made very apparent that that's on the roadmap doing what they've done, building an order book fully on chain, building the HLP vault, democratizing market, making running a fully transparent order book. I think those are all things that are incredibly commendable, that bring a lot of value and should be worth noting. I think if you look at dydx for example, right again this goes back to the philosophy of why you would even want to have a perp decks or an exchange in general on chain which is been reports that FTX might have been front running users might, might have been front running their order flow. You know, there's been plenty of reports that Robinhood sells order flow on a pretty habitual basis. You know, having an order book off chain just means that there is always the risk that the people running that order book can do whatever they want with it. And with hyperliquid that's not the case.
00:21:28.821 - 00:22:09.959, Speaker B: Every single order follows a strict time order rule case. You can see all the transactions happening right now. They've launched read only validator nodes, which aren't full nodes in the test net. But you can authenticate everything that hyperliquid is saying is happening on Chain. And I think that that in and of itself is already a pretty solid value proposition. But I think it's also incredibly early. I think hyperliquid runs like multiple updates a week, and Ethereum maybe does that, maybe does one serious state update every few months.
00:22:09.959 - 00:22:53.555, Speaker B: And so you do need a certain degree of centralization in the early stages if you want to ship at that pace. It will also help performance on the network having less validation. But I think going forward it's been made very clear that decentralization is something that they want to work on. And we don't even have a token live yet. So it's really hard to run full validator nodes without a token. So we're not even there yet. And I think ultimately, as hyperliquid moves from where it is today to something more decentralized, one, I think we should comment them on what they've built already and maybe wait and see on what they do with decentralizing the validator set.
00:22:53.555 - 00:23:33.045, Speaker B: But two, I think the users will decide. I think if the users care about having their perp stacks fully decentralized, they'll wait until hyperliquid gets there. If you don't care, you just want the best place, the best venue to trade perps on Chain, then you're going to go there now. And so the first thing is, you know, I think it's, it's, it's silly to say that hyperliquid hasn't added value or is not a valid crypto protocol because it's not fully decentralized. I think it'll get there over time. And I also think that, you know, users will end up doing what users do. And so it's, it's, it's, it's basically a work in progress.
00:23:34.105 - 00:24:39.501, Speaker A: Yeah, I like what you said about people only really care about it not being 100% decentralized when it actually starts doing well. And as a Solana fan for the last few years, I've certainly been privy to that as well. And I do also think because Bitcoin was the first asset and then Ethereum sort of followed after it and they both needed a very heavy skew on all of the properties of decentralization, there's just been this sort of blanket approach to projects ever since. And I think this cycle really has been the first time where people have started to question, well, does it actually need all of the properties in order to be the best product possible? And I think certainly in the case of perps exchange, it's not necessarily the case because ultimately you need market makers to get on there and they will then bring users and the market makers, they can't spend a dollar per transaction for sure. They can't wait 12 seconds for a block. Things like this, it's just not possible. So you have to get the latency down as little as possible and then the costs as well.
00:24:39.501 - 00:24:48.185, Speaker A: So on the costs actually is it gasless? Do I see on your, on your report, do you know how they can make a blockchain gasless?
00:24:50.205 - 00:25:19.173, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean they own the infrastructure layer and so basically any transaction that's not inflating state bloat is gasless. And so transactions are not really adding anything to the state. Um, and so they've made the gasless trading spot is gasless. Trading purpose is gasless. Um, I'm not sure if that will change with the incoming evm. I'll need to check on that. But I know right now the trading experience is gasless.
00:25:19.173 - 00:26:06.235, Speaker B: You do pay trading fees which mostly go to market makers. Um, but, but yeah, I mean that's just an example of something that you wouldn't be able to do on a general purpose blockchain. I think if you're a market maker submitting thousands of orders, posting thousands of limit orders within a very concentrated time window. I mean the first thing is you don't want to pay gas on all of those orders. That's just going to lead to worse execution for the end user, having to basically widen your spread to make up for those gas costs. And two, you want to be able to cancel your orders when they get stale for free. And that's just not very easy to do on a general purpose blockchain like Solano or Ethereum.
00:26:06.235 - 00:26:48.897, Speaker B: And so sorry, there's like a super loud siren. Where was I? Let me finish my train of thought. Forget where I was. That just completely threw me off. I thought someone was playing like oh yeah, yeah. So the gasless thing is that's one thing, but also just basic things like atomic liquidations, funding distributions on a set time interval. I think those are all things that are just a lot easier to do on an alt layer 1 or an app chain and to.
00:26:48.897 - 00:27:45.041, Speaker B: To keep. I think one thing that I always need to remind myself when I'm like thinking about hyperliquid is that Jeff was Jeff and a lot of the core contributors on the team, they were high frequency traders before this. They weren't really crypto builders at first, they really picked up that side of the business after they had started. And so they're building everything with trading first in mind, optimizing for traders, optimizing for market makers. And so does the average user care about a couple of bits of better execution or a couple of milliseconds of better latency? For the most part, probably not. But I think if you're a cream of the crop market maker or a trader and you want to be trading things on chain, hyperliquid is the way to go. And I think app chains and alt layer ones in general are probably the direction that we want to take.
00:27:45.041 - 00:28:04.641, Speaker B: I mean someone's not going to hold themselves up over having to bridge to be able to access X percent, better execution, better liquidity on every single transaction and not have to pay gas when you're market making. I mean those are huge value adds. So yeah, I think that's important to keep in mind.
00:28:04.833 - 00:28:51.925, Speaker A: I'm still trying to get my head around it a little bit because the way that I see it is they, they can only offer no gas as long as they don't have a permissionless validator set. And even if they'd had a permission validator set and they brought in, you know, 2100 entities, whatever of people they trust, if it remains gasless, surely they, they have to be making the money elsewhere. They're not just going to sort of give the money away for free. So it's just trying to work out how to avoid really the incentives for these insider validators to try and make money in maybe an underhand way, if that's possible. If they're not receiving money for validating the transactions.
00:28:52.265 - 00:29:50.835, Speaker B: Yeah, there are actually no, you do have to pay gas on the network. You pay gas when you see the new wallet, you pay gas if you want to list a new token, you pay gas if you're a protocol and you want to build an application that does certain things. And so anything that's, you know, significantly increasing the state on the network, you have to pay gas for. So there is, there are gas costs associated with using the network. It's just for their perp decks and for their spot market that currently isn't the case. Again, I don't know if this is going to apply to what happens post evm, but yeah, I think it's just one of those Trade offs where yeah, you'll probably have less total gas costs that could end up trickling back down to a validator set. But also what's the trade off here? And that's hey, really cheap trading experience for traders and market makers who care about.
00:29:52.025 - 00:30:41.959, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I completely agree. I think they have taken the right approach and I'm just wondering if in the end state this is like the best setup because again if you, if you did want to start increasing that validator set likely like it is that the latency goes up. And as I say, I'm struggling to imagine a world where you don't have to start introducing some fees for all the trading because like work is still being done by somebody. So you know, I wonder if this is sort of the optimal long term architecture and I'm definitely not someone that everything has to be 100% decentralized. I think it should apply to the use case. So yeah, it's an interesting approach and happy to sort of see how it goes on from there. How about it being an app chain on itself because often it said so.
00:30:41.959 - 00:31:23.345, Speaker A: Carl Somani certainly for multicoin, he's a big proponent of this that maybe one of the only few use cases which makes sense as an app chain are perp dexs. But as soon as you start introducing like spot then so for Perexes you can just transfer over USDC and they're all derivatives so you don't actually need the actual underlying assets. As soon as you do spot trading then you do need the underlying assets and so therefore you have to transfer all of those assets onto the chain. And I believe that their spot trading is. In your report you said about 25 million TVL I think so it's obviously a lot less than the perp side. And do you think that that is a barrier that's going to be difficult to overcome because they're an app chain.
00:31:23.845 - 00:32:39.821, Speaker B: So I think the main thing about an app chain focused on a perpetrator like DYDX and what hyperliquid is trying to do. And this goes back to what I was saying earlier about no one really knows what hyperliquid is right now is they're building out, you know, more of a full fledged layer one. But I don't think it is their intention nor do I think it should head this way for hyperliquid being like a full general purpose blockchain. Like people have made comps to Solana. Like I don't think it should be Solana that would ruin the whole purpose of what they're trying to do. And so having this very specific L1 that's more than an app chain, but also has protocols that have been curated to either be composable with the order book, if that's something that they value, or really just offer really, really high quality trading services that builds off hyperliquids architecture, uses hyperliquids native Oracle. They could use their native spot market, they could use a composable on chain order book.
00:32:39.821 - 00:33:17.617, Speaker B: I mean, all of these things are super new. And so I don't even like calling hyperliquid an app chain because it's like, what is it trying to do? And so the spot market right now is very, very new. It's really, really interesting. They've got a couple of features on there that I haven't seen anywhere else. The first is HIP2, which is native liquidity. And so you plug into their order book as a protocol trying to list a token. And if you're just trying to launch a token, you don't actually have to see liquidity.
00:33:17.617 - 00:33:58.069, Speaker B: There's native liquidity built into the spot market, which I think is super interesting. And two, um, it's a permissionless auction process. But there's only a certain number of spot tokens that are allowed to get listed on hyperliquid. And so like, let's say, I think it's like one token listing every 30 hours or so. So that's less than a token a day. So that's something really interesting. Again, going back to this like super curated, high quality trading L1, you know, if you go on Solana, you try to buy a meme that, I don't know, maybe Trump said something funny and you're trying to buy it.
00:33:58.069 - 00:34:58.517, Speaker B: There's already like 25 different things that you can buy. And that's not a problem for Solana, obviously. But for Hyperliquid, I think curation here is something that's unique to their ecosystem and I'm excited to see how that pans out. We have an analyst here, Justin Baba, who has talked about this a ton. But if hyperliquid ends up growing to some immense size and delivers enormous value and there's just all sorts of on chain trading activity happening on hyperliquid, how much would you pay to list on Binance? And so I think going back to where those fees come from to pay validator sets, I think that's potentially a source of revenue for the layer one, but I'm curious to see how it plays out. At this point, I'm not Sure. What happens? I think I agree with Kyle Somani.
00:34:58.517 - 00:35:21.645, Speaker B: I think having a perp decks on an app chain is probably the better solution. But also this could be something between an app chain and a general purpose layer one. And yeah, I mean I don't, I don't really know how that's going to go. Like, I'm, I'm, I'm very excited to see what happens. I don't even think that the team expected for this to happen until recently.
00:35:23.225 - 00:35:33.285, Speaker A: Yeah, it is very interesting, this curation list and is that, is that just for spot or is that for perps Markets, the. This curated 30 list?
00:35:35.025 - 00:36:31.467, Speaker B: I don't think that perps are permissionless to listen or I'm not sure. I think the team has launched per products but for the spot market it's certainly the case where if you want to launch a ticker you have to outbid everybody else for that 30 day period. And I think the team has mentioned maybe in the future they create some sort of a separate permissioned path for real protocols that want to build on Hyperliquid. But, but yeah, I'm not sure. I mean we have an analyst here working on Ronin, which is a gaming chain. I believe it's a layer one and they're specifically bringing in applications and gaming protocols that they think are going to add value to their network and so filtering out the noise, extremely high quality applications. We're going to focus on a specific vertical.
00:36:31.467 - 00:36:45.003, Speaker B: You know, that's something that I think hyperliquid is building towards at this point. But yeah, it's, it's fun to, it's fun to speculate about but there's currently just not much to go off of. As you said, I think the spot TVL is pretty low in comparison.
00:36:45.179 - 00:37:13.305, Speaker A: Yeah. But no, it'll be interesting to see how that curation list goes because I definitely agree it's good to have just quality assets. But at the same time, firstly I think for meme coins I do think that you miss out maybe on the virality if you're then having to compete for a spot 30 hours. So whilst you kind of meme coins you can't like tap into the here and now basically. Of what. Yeah, of what's going on. But I think it's.
00:37:13.305 - 00:38:02.433, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very interesting concept. The other point I'd make is I kind of think that the best apps in crypto have generally been ones where it is completely permissionless to start up trading pairs as you have on Uniswap. And I know for like, for Example on prediction markets, I'd love to see those start to become permissionless to create markets. On prediction markets there's obviously always nags that you have to get through and make sure that there's no manipulation going on. But I'm generally of the view that permissionless approach to things will generally prosper in the end. But, but yeah, it's very interesting and novel and yeah see how it turns out. Do you know how it's gone so far? I believe there were some that were definitely paying quite a bit of money maybe a month or two ago.
00:38:02.609 - 00:38:54.805, Speaker B: I think some have hit the six figures. I should say that listing a token is permissionless, you just have to outbid everybody else. But theoretically anybody could launch any token. But yeah, no, there was a certain point when the spot market was running a little bit hotter where I think auction prices were in the six figure range. And so you can imagine how wild that gets if hyper liquid really does or if the spot market on hyperliquid really starts taking off. And I think there'll just be some natural leakage from PERS traders going like, oh, like what's going on over there in the hyper liquid spot market land. But right now it's mostly, I would say like hyperliquid Maxis speculating on mostly a few token tickers.
00:38:54.805 - 00:39:03.765, Speaker B: So yeah, it definitely remains to be seen what becomes of the spot market but I think the team has treated it like sort of an experiment.
00:39:05.345 - 00:39:39.075, Speaker A: I think one of the other great things about this project is no VCS. It's almost become like the Bitcoin 21 million. Like there is this aura around the project because there's no VC money that's gone in and I believe the team hasn't even been making money to date. So it really is just going to be tokens for the team and tokens for the users. Jupiter as well that has done something similar. So yeah, I think that's going to be a massive tailwind as well for the project. How do you see the token launch going when every play it does happen?
00:39:39.235 - 00:40:22.415, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's, I don't know what it is about like no VC backed teams. There have been multiple times where I stumble into a protocol and I'm just like I love this protocol, I love this team. And then I found out, find out like down the line that they didn't take any VC money. So maybe it's, it's, it's, it's either to know VC aura or these founders just naturally have aura because something, something about them is Appealing to me, you know, Aerodrome, I think I just released a report at least as of recording this morning on Aerodrome. I think they also didn't take any venture money. And yeah, like right now I'm almost, I almost want this token launch to happen for the team. Like, I don't know, I'm hurting just looking at them putting this much work and not getting paid.
00:40:22.415 - 00:41:07.465, Speaker B: But I think that, Jeff, you know, I heard somewhere that they, like, basically a lot of them ended up putting money into the HLP vault, which, you know, kudos to you. If you want to make money, at least do it like how any of your users would if you really believe in the project. And so right now I think that that has been a source of at least personal gain for them. But yeah, so far, like no VCs, I think less than like 10 contributors. I don't think this team is very big. And so we've seen a lot of TGs this year. I talked about a few in my report where I think the public reception was just very negative.
00:41:07.465 - 00:41:44.835, Speaker B: And that's because when you're, I mean, as a project, I don't think any project goes out there and thinks, look, I want this token launch to suck. I want my community to be ticked off. I want nobody to get this token. But when you have a whole bunch of contributors, when you have large investors, there's just going to be a certain level of internal pressure that limits what you can do for the community. And a lot of times the community ends up getting shafted. And it remains to be seen what happens with the hyperliquid tge. I'm not here to predict exactly what happens.
00:41:44.835 - 00:42:19.683, Speaker B: I think in my report I gave sort of a wide valuation range of what potential point values could be. But I mean, right now the setup looks, looks pretty interesting. I mean, you have basically the tokens that are going to go to the team. I don't know if they'll be vested. I mean, I imagine a portion would be the tokens that are going to go to future validators. And then really there's a wide range of what this airdrop could end up looking like for the community. And that's gotten the community pretty riled up.
00:42:19.683 - 00:43:15.035, Speaker B: I don't know how into the hyper liquid lore you are, but 800 points crypto adair, I think has sparked up some fun conversations about what the point valuations could be. I've certainly had my take, so I think it'll be a fun one. I think it could surprise a lot of people. And also I think There's a lot of capital that's sidelined that doesn't have exposure to hyperliquid but maybe love what they're doing. And so liquid funds, venture capital firms, people who would've gladly invested in hyperliquid, I'm sure at a very, very large valuation right now just have zero exposure. And so what happens to that capital when there's an actual token live? Who knows? And so I'm very excited about tge. I'm hoping that it could be maybe a reversal of the trend here of just down only TGEs.
00:43:15.035 - 00:43:20.795, Speaker B: But yeah, I have, I have no idea. This is not financial advice.
00:43:21.695 - 00:44:21.855, Speaker A: Yeah, fingers crossed it, it's reversal. I actually did a tweet during the week. You know, it's a fairly well worn argument now but just the, I was looking at Camino and margin on Solana and at one point Kamino had maybe one tenth of the TVL of marginfi and eventually they did an airdrop and it was good. And you know, people got like decent money, maybe not life changing but pretty solid money. But if they'd just been given the opportunity to actually invest in those tokens when it was 1/10 the value of margin fi then they were likely to get a sort of 1020 x as sort of beat, beat out that competitor. And it's just a shame that this cycle we're not having more opportunities like that where we can actually ride the token up, create evangelists for the project rather than here we find ourselves again, everyone's farming the same project, hoping that it's going to be a good airdrop. And I really sincerely hope it will be a good airdrop for a lot of people.
00:44:22.715 - 00:44:43.649, Speaker B: Yeah. And again, I have no idea what this thing is going to trade at. I don't know if it's going to be up or down. I don't even know what comps to use to be honest. Again, going back to, going back to hyperliquid potentially being a new primitive. It's just really hard to pin down what to value this thing against. And so there have been the loftiest of expectations.
00:44:43.649 - 00:46:21.123, Speaker B: There have been, you know, very bearish expectations for tge. But I think one thing that, that I like about just the hyperliquid narrative set like not even, not even talking about prices for a second is there's just hasn't been a lot of things to buy this cycle. Like there's been if you're a liquid fund, I mean what are you buying? Like maybe you're buying MakerDAO, maybe you're buying Ton, maybe you're buying Solana, but what are the assets that you can actually buy in relative size that you can build like an investment memo around and you've seen like a pretty eyebrow raising investment in Drift by a certain vc and I don't know what the intentions were there. I'm a big fan of the Drift team, but I think it's like, what do people even have to buy in Defi nowadays? And I think Even this DeFi 1.0 narrative that's coming back is a function of there being just no new interesting defi tokens to buy. So let's just revisit the old stuff because they're still doing well and they are doing well. But what happens when you actually get a Defi launch that's doing something new, that is a real product that as you said is the highest traded or is the most is doing the highest amount of trading volumes right now in the perp deck space that also has a layer, one that's put in the work to build their own consensus to build a lot of the tools that they use today.
00:46:21.123 - 00:46:42.065, Speaker B: And so I think a lot of the hard work is already done. Like what happens when that token goes live? I don't know. But I think a narrative is set up very well for more attention at least to be paid to this project in a point of the cycle where we're all kind of desperate for stories to latch onto.
00:46:42.965 - 00:47:30.711, Speaker A: Yeah, because the examples there that you came up with, they all started last cycle, basically. So as you say, if you actually have to write an investment memo around something which had launched this cycle, I think you're really struggling because the few apps with product market fit which have launched this cycle don't have tokens. Which again comes to to exactly the same issue that we keep talking about. You mentioned drift and it sounded quite spicy, so I just wanted to push on that button a little bit more. But I mean, do you think so obviously Drift, it's on Solana, which is fast, but the latency is limited by the laws of physics. And it's at 400 milliseconds roughly. It could get down to maybe 200 milliseconds, but balance is 15 milliseconds.
00:47:30.711 - 00:47:54.135, Speaker A: Some of these sort of L2s, you know, some of these new perplexes are lower than that, they're 5 milliseconds or less. So you really can't do on a general purpose l1 what can be produced on these, on these new examples. So are you sort of perma negative on something Like Drift? Or do you think it serves a different purpose because of its atomic compatibility? On.
00:47:54.225 - 00:48:17.339, Speaker B: From now on, I don't know much about the composability thesis. I did read the, I did read the memo. Look, I think Drift's value is going to be like just that, like it's on Solano. There are a lot of people on Solano. There are a lot of new crypto enthusiasts on Solano. Like Masari. We just had like a class of like 11 interns of kids in college.
00:48:17.339 - 00:49:03.325, Speaker B: And some of these guys had Phantom. They didn't have Metamask. And so I'm like, what, what is happening? What is happening to the world? Um, but there are a lot of new speculators that are going to be on Solana and they're going to want a place to trade liquid perps. And I think Drift can deliver plenty of value by supplying that. It doesn't need to be like, like I said, the amount of people that need the level of execution of a binance, you know, probably not a huge portion of crypto, probably even a less portion of who's on Solana. And so I think that there will be plenty of value in just having a product out there. And I actually really like what Drift is doing by launching a prediction market.
00:49:03.325 - 00:49:42.923, Speaker B: I mean, everybody is launching a prediction market these days. But look, I think it's a great product actually and the early signs are encouraging. And so I think Drift potentially has that option of being a protocol owned, defi super app on Solana. I think that was part of the memo as well. And I can buy that. But like you said, I think if we're just trying to really test the limits of what is the best perfect product we can build on chain, fully on chain. Hyperliquid is doing that and it's hard to do that on a general purpose blockchain.
00:49:42.923 - 00:50:12.745, Speaker B: It just, it just, it just flat out is. I don't know if it's impossible, but it's just really hard to do. And so, yeah, if you ask anybody that trades, you know, frequently, you ask them what they think about Drift, I think today they probably would say that it's, it's, it's not a perfect, it's not a perfect trading experience. But you know, I think there'll be a lot of value as they continue to iterate on just being on Salon, but that's all I'll say there. I think it was a cheeky question though.
