00:00:14.480 - 00:00:21.934, Speaker A: Welcome to episode two of unlayered the state of Solana Defi. And before we dive into all that, Dave, how's it going? What's new?
00:00:22.014 - 00:00:36.546, Speaker B: It's good, Sal. Good. Another busy week in the world of crypto. I don't know if what you've been seeing on Twitter, but I think it's been dominated this week by meme Coin season. I've been going absolutely crazy, both on Ethereum.
00:00:36.650 - 00:00:38.106, Speaker A: Oh, for sure. Pepe.
00:00:38.210 - 00:00:40.138, Speaker B: Pepe. Did you. Did you get any pepe?
00:00:40.266 - 00:00:58.812, Speaker A: So here's the deal with Pepe. I was kind of keeping tabs on it. I heard initial rumblings about it about two weeks ago, maybe two, and some change I thought about aping in. So it already, at that point, had a run up of a few hundred percent. I was on uniswap. I was just like, like, ah, this smells like a rug. And so I decided not to do it.
00:00:58.812 - 00:01:13.988, Speaker A: And now I'm kicking myself. Cause that probably would have been, you know, at least a thousand percent gain at this point. I didn't. Candidly, I didn't think it would shoot up to a billion plus market cap. That's always been kind of. My barometer is like, can I get to that? Clearly it did. But no, I'm kicking myself right now.
00:01:14.116 - 00:01:43.046, Speaker B: It feels slightly strange that we're in this meme coin season because to me, it almost feels like people are just desperate to ape into something and. And they've just gone for the most degen thing. And really, it feels like a bad look on the whole space that this is all that people can get excited about. The same doge was created, I don't know, way back when, and we're basically still at doge levels of crypto adoption. So it feels a bit disheartening that this is all that people can get excited about during a bear market.
00:01:43.190 - 00:02:50.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually have maybe not an opposite view here, but it makes me really happy that people are getting excited about meme coins. Certainly meme coins have no utility, but the reason why I get excited is it means that the appetite for this asset class, broadly, the risk appetite, is still there to a degree, and people are willing to will these tokens into existence and into some semblance of relevance. And so from that lens, as a builder in this space, it just gives me a lot of hope that, you know, the entire space isn't dead, is it? And there's actually a lot of parallels to what's happening specifically on bitcoin with BRC twenties, and we can even just go back to ordinals, the end of last year, beginning with this year, where a lot of excitement around those sort of innovations for seemingly use cases that aren't that useful. It always starts like this. It always starts as a toy or something that's a joke. And over time I think it will allow, it'll kind of be a gate for people to enter the space and get interested in it. So it's funny, it's kind of a random coin that's useless.
00:02:50.604 - 00:03:08.170, Speaker A: But at the same time, the fact that this thing had, and I was reading this on Missari's listserv, the fastest growing token to a billion plus market cap ever is pepe. It gives me some weird optimism that maybe a bull market isn't as far away as we think it is.
00:03:08.362 - 00:03:47.354, Speaker B: I suppose another take that I've got. I don't know if you've ever listened to a guy called Josh Rosenthal, who talks about how this is the crypto renaissance and how he sees lots of parallels to the original renaissance. And one message that he always puts forward is that the original renaissance, it wasn't all this high end art. There was a lot of just memes and low quality stuff that sort of pushed the whole movement forward. And his point that he always puts forward is just don't discount memes. They are actually hugely important, and they may seem silly and irrelevant and stupid at this point, but they are developing this crypto culture and helping push the space forward as sort of as silly as. As it may seem.
00:03:47.514 - 00:03:50.090, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a super cool point. I need to was.
00:03:50.122 - 00:03:50.930, Speaker C: Did you say it was a thread.
00:03:50.962 - 00:03:53.506, Speaker A: Or an article for reference? I want to check that out.
00:03:53.570 - 00:04:13.692, Speaker B: He does, he's done a couple of podcasts. Josh Rosenthal on the crypto renaissance. Really? Yeah, really interesting. The other interesting point, of course, has been the congestion that this has caused to both the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains having to suddenly deal with this influx of users and volume. What are your views on that, Sal?
00:04:13.868 - 00:04:39.782, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. It's kind of reminding me of the minting of other deeds last April. So April 2022, when people are paying more in gas than the actual cost of the deed itself. So the gas, some people are paying 2000 plus dollars worth of eth for other deed that was worth less. It reminds me of that. And the mania is for a different reason. It's a lot of it has to do with kind of this meme coin trading volume.
00:04:39.782 - 00:05:18.942, Speaker A: It's kind of like a great advertisement for why scalable, monolithic l one s might have a bright future where this type of stuff does not happen on chains like Solana. And I think an excellent example to support this is the mad lads NFT launch that happened a few weeks ago where there was just an insane amount of demand for this, where the actual volume for the NFT ranked number one across all chains, including ethereum. And yet the network never went down. It shrugged off all of the demand. So my view is that like, and I was like playing around, I saw some, some tweets where like some people are paying dollar 200 in gas on ETh. That's terrible. I mean, it's.
00:05:18.942 - 00:05:36.894, Speaker A: But that's not nearly cheap enough to be usable for everyday users. You do really have to be kind of a millionaire to transact on chain that has such high fees. And so, yeah, I guess my gut reaction is great. Tailwinds for Solana. I don't know. What do you think, Dave?
00:05:37.434 - 00:06:21.484, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I completely agree. Because I think there's been two interesting things. Firstly, ETh L1 has gone crazy with fees, as you say, dollar 250 fees, which basically prices out 99% of the world's population. People can't afford that to interact with the l one. But the other second order effect is the l two transaction fees have also gone up, in my opinion, way, way too high to actually be usable for most of the population, which is sort of $1 $2 per transaction. I think it's something like 73% of the world's population spend less than $10 a day. So the idea that people are going to spend a large chunk of their daily allowance on, on transactions, even on the l two layer, suggests to me that it's just not ready for mass adoption either.
00:06:21.644 - 00:06:46.184, Speaker A: Yeah, that's funny. It's like we try to get away from this legacy infrastructure. We have this quote, unquote, scaling approach with l two s, and now when the l one's congested, the l two s are just at parity with the legacy infra, where it's a few dollars to send money around instantly. That's hilarious. And that is the opposite of an advertisement for crypto. That's basically a signal that we're pretty far away from being useful for most.
00:06:46.224 - 00:06:47.176, Speaker C: People in the world.
00:06:47.320 - 00:07:30.188, Speaker B: I think when people actually come over and start using Solana and start using the applications on it, a lot of people do have that aha moment. I wrote a tweet actually just this week saying that. I mean, it's completely off guesswork, but my assumption is that almost everyone on Solana has come there from Ethereum, has at least interacted with Ethereum and decided that Solana is where they'd like to spend their time. Whereas I suspect a much, much, much smaller percentage of people who use Ethereum spend all their time on Ethereum, have actually tried Solana because it's just one of those things. Once you try it, it's very hard to go back to spending even $2 per fee, let alone dollar 250 per fee. It just feels completely different.
00:07:30.316 - 00:08:12.614, Speaker A: Absolutely. And speaking of the difference between Solana and Ethereum, one of the biggest or the starkest contrasts between these two ecosystems is what's happening on the defi side for both of them. And I just have the metrics pulled up here. So Ethereum defi TvL total value locked is 25 point or, sorry, 27.54 billion, according to Defi Llama. Solana, on the other hand, is sitting ranked number eleven across all the chains at $263 million. So obviously quite a stark contrast on the order of 100 x difference between the two.
00:08:12.614 - 00:08:35.314, Speaker A: But again, I think, and this is where we're getting into the purpose of this episode, state of Solana Defi. We don't actually think that this metric tells the whole story. I think there's a lot actually happening in Solana Defi, and we'll get into the details of that with our interview with Barrett from Cypher. What do you think? What's your take on Solana Defi and these metrics? What have you found so far?
00:08:35.434 - 00:09:11.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of things to say. Obviously, Solana TVL has taken a hit. It's taken a hit because of Alameda going bust and obviously being convicted of fraud. And obviously they had a load of money. And also the outages, of course, has potentially reduced confidence in, in Solana Defi. But I think it's not quite as clear cut as people say, because if you consider Ethereum, they're basically, they've gone through two bull cycles, complete bull cycles. They spent most of that time as the only credible smart contract blockchain.
00:09:11.174 - 00:09:59.530, Speaker B: So they've basically been uncontested for years now, have gone through two bull cycles. Their market cap got up to over half a trillion last bull market, and it currently sits, I think, around 220 billion. So for me, theres just an element of, if you have that much capital in the base asset of the ecosystem, inevitably a lot of it is going to flow into Defi. And I think if Solana has a really successful next bull market, if we ever have another bull market, then I think that money will also flow into Solana Defi. So I dont think its quite as clear cut as everyone has decided. Ethereum defi is the only place you can park your money. I think its more a case of Ethereum holders put their money into Ethereum defi, just as I think Solana holders would put their money into Solana Defi.
00:09:59.530 - 00:10:04.530, Speaker B: Should we be as successful and manage to get up to these crazy valuations at some point?
00:10:04.562 - 00:10:48.390, Speaker A: Raoul, theres two forces competing here. You brought up the first one, which is theres a ton of capital already parked in the Ethereum ecosystem. Concretely, what I mean by that is of this $25 billion, any l two that attaches itself to the EVM can quickly accumulate TVL. And the best example of this is arbitrum, if you date back to July of last year. So July 2022, which is, for all intents and purposes, during a bear market, their TVL has forexed from about 600 million to $2.4 billion today, which ranks arbitrum today number four, actually. And so they rocketed up in TVL very quickly.
00:10:48.390 - 00:10:49.398, Speaker A: That's kind of my point.
00:10:49.526 - 00:10:50.662, Speaker C: But the issue is, and we talked.
00:10:50.678 - 00:11:39.154, Speaker A: About it in the beginning of this segment, it still is kind of beholden to congestion on Ethereum. It's not as cheap as maybe we think it is, so on and so forth, whereas Solana, completely different design space, completely different blockchain, so that you can't really tap into existing capital anywhere, especially after the fall of FTX, we know it's another on ramp that's gone. So it's just a little bit harder to onboard new money into Solana. And so it's, TVL hasn't really recovered since it's sitting at about 200 million. But it's primitives, its speed, its low transaction fees, and just the fact that Solana itself was architected specifically for DeFi in the early days. I mean, their initial pitch Deck said Nasdaq and blockchain speeds, and that was kind of Anatoly's initial fascination, was programmatic electronic trading. That's kind of why he built Solana in the first place.
00:11:39.154 - 00:12:27.612, Speaker A: It seems really well built for a long term future in DeFi, but the question is, how does Solana bridge that gap and get to a future where it does have a lot of users and money on the chain? And that's something we'll touch on in more detail in this episode. But just kind of teeing it up for the, for the audience here. Now we're going to move into our interview with Barrett. Barrett is the founder of Cypher Protocol, which is accessible at Cypher Trade, and he goes by Twitter. Cipher protocol is a decentralized protocol on Solana where you can access margin trading perps and a whole suite of other products. They have a very aggressive roadmap that you can check out on their website. And Barrett is an expert on all things DeFi, specifically on the solution Solana side.
00:12:27.612 - 00:12:33.144, Speaker A: So very exciting conversation where we dig into the state of Solana Defi and what's to come.
00:12:40.444 - 00:12:46.052, Speaker C: So we are joined by Barrett, founder of Cypher. Thanks for coming on today, Barrett.
00:12:46.148 - 00:12:49.428, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you guys for having me. I'm excited for the pod.
00:12:49.556 - 00:13:20.160, Speaker C: Likewise, likewise. Definitely an interesting topic here, Defi and Solana, and we kind of just want to get right into the hard questions here. But Barrett, as we stand here today, Solana is number twelve in DeFi TvL across all chains, for a total of about 260 million. This is good for about one 100th the size of East TVL, which is currently first by a good long shot. My question, just to start off here, is, is it over for Solana Defi?
00:13:20.272 - 00:14:21.140, Speaker D: I don't think so. The cliche is, like, we're also early, but, like, it actually is still in, like, defi's, like, lifecycle pretty early on. Market macro environments are all down. Solana's definitely taken more of a hit than other chains, but by no means do I think it's, like, over for Solana. I think that the underlying tech, it's currently the only one, in my opinion, that has, like, the potential to scale to support what DeFi's vision is, in my opinion, which is being able to replace or accumulate a large amount of the volume that we see in tradfite today. If you're going to do that, you need a chain that has that path to scalability, that can compete with the Nasdaq, which does 429,000 transactions a second. If you're not getting to those numbers or close to those numbers, I think it's going to be very hard to really move a significant amount of capital on chain.
00:14:21.140 - 00:14:44.846, Speaker D: And so for me, I still believe that Solana is the place to be, place to build. Obviously, RTVL is down and hey, the ecosystem is putting out a lot of awesome updates. Protocols are continuing to build and launch. So overall, I'm pretty bullish on Solana, and I think that some of the things that we'll cover later on in the pod will, we'll go into, like, more detail on why those are.
00:14:44.950 - 00:15:11.344, Speaker C: For sure. For sure. You kind of got at this second point, though, which is we have two views here, right? There's the view on Twitter sphere and that conferences where people think Solana Defy is dead. And then there's the view from people like you who are building in this space. And there seems to be a lot of optimism here. What is that kind of collective feeling you're seeing on the builder side? Are there just projects and things happening quietly that you think could really change the game here for salon on Defi?
00:15:11.464 - 00:16:00.394, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that there's like a number of projects that are out or coming out. I was like reading through some of the grizzly Thon submissions, which I think are pretty exciting. And what you can build from. No code tooling for building smart contracts. And I think that, or at least like on chain applications, being able to link a lot of stuff, they integrate with Zapier, which I think helps ease that developer experience, even for non technical people, which I think is, again, really important. It's one of the key points about traditional tech and how easy it is to build applications which blockchain doesn't really have. ETH is a little bit farther along in the developer experience.
00:16:00.394 - 00:16:36.866, Speaker D: I think Solana's made a lot of leaps in that bounds in that regard. But some of those projects coming out from grizzly Thon, I think are really exciting. There are some protocols for effectively enabling people to passively provide liquidity on order books, which I think is really important because given my background, I'm a big believer in the order book being the mechanism of exchange for assets. And so those are really exciting to see. There's helium is coming online, I think, this month or next month. Yeah. So that's really exciting.
00:16:36.866 - 00:17:45.488, Speaker D: And I know there's some other big gaming aspects that are going to be launching on Solana, which I think is crucial for an ecosystem in general. You're going to get a lot more users. We saw this with Stepn, which wasn't really a DeFi app, but interacted a lot with DeFi applications and provides a lot of liquidity, a lot of users and those types of applications. Integrating more into the Defi sphere, I think is overall incredibly impactful. We still have a lot of the Dexs, and I think that there are some unique things about what you can do on Solana that makes or is a little harder to do on other changes because of the throughput and cost of actually building on Solana, which I think are important for building these more robust and complex applications that can attract those large capital managers or movers to bring in that liquidity to the Solana. Ecosystem.
00:17:45.656 - 00:18:17.194, Speaker B: Yeah, completely agreed. And while the costs are low and the latency is also very low, I think another narrative which people have against Solana is the number of outages which it suffered over the last 1218 months. A lot of people say that layer one should not be doing this and that therefore, there's no point trying to build Defi on a platform which keeps on having outages every few months. Any thoughts on that and how critical it is to Solana's future as a Defi hub?
00:18:17.314 - 00:19:02.104, Speaker D: I mean, look, as somebody who is building in Defi, it's definitely hard to deal with. Right. And it does set the chain back from, like, a sentiment and user standpoint. I do understand what they say is, like, when you're building on the frontier, right, of distributed systems, especially for a blockchain in particular, when you're pushing those limits, things are going to happen. Right. I'm not saying that it is acceptable. We obviously, in the Defi community voiced, I think, a lot of outrage about this last outage, saying that, hey, this can't happen again, because every time you do this, it does set the ecosystem back.
00:19:02.104 - 00:19:43.174, Speaker D: I think that they have taken it very seriously since this last one, and moving a ton of engineering resources to increasing stability. I think that we have a lot of really awesome things going on in the pipeline as well, with jump building fire dancers. So a second client, and it's really interesting because it's all from scratch. Right. And so I think that that'll help increase the stability quite a bit also throughput as well. I think Dapps as well are. Our team has definitely built a lot of safeguards into the protocol itself for traders that are on an order book.
00:19:43.174 - 00:20:28.160, Speaker D: Right. Like time and force orders. I know other protocols are doing this or have done this. And so I think that those things are really important to build into your system, to make it resilient in the face of these outages and to protect the people or teams or trading firms that are using these applications. But again, yeah, we can't continue to have the chain go down because it just sets us back farther and farther. But I do believe that with the change in not direction, but the change in resource allocation for robust testing and adversarial testing, that this will be solved here in the short term. Right.
00:20:28.160 - 00:20:44.156, Speaker D: I'm not saying that it won't go down ever again, but I think that our probability of going down definitely decreases with the amount of resources that, you know, labs is allocating to kind of the scalability or the stability efforts. Right.
00:20:44.220 - 00:21:36.080, Speaker C: No, I think that makes sense. Certainly that has been probably the most consistent narrative against DeFi and Solana I've heard so far, but I think I agree with your sentiment, too. It seems unlikely that this will continue being a problem in the long term. And I think it's mostly a product of just how quickly Solana is pushing the bounds, so to speak, and doing things that you really aren't seeing on many other chains. One quick follow up here, though, and I guess the broader point I'm making with this question is, how do you measure the health of a Defi ecosystem on a chain? Solana had this weird story that came out last year about two brothers faking about $7.5 billion worth of TVL on the chain, and it was accounting for tens of percent of all the TVL on Solana. I already had this view that TVL is not a great way to measure this stuff.
00:21:36.080 - 00:21:47.288, Speaker C: Anyways, the question I'm driving at here is, you know, how do you respond to, like, that story people sometimes bring up, and what is, like, maybe a better way to measure defi health on Solana or any other ecosystem?
00:21:47.376 - 00:22:15.340, Speaker D: I definitely think, like, TVL is a important metric in the sense that, like, it does show you, like, some proxy of assets on chain. Right. I don't think that it actually did more damage to Solana's reputation than, you know, network outages or congestion. Because it's not like that happens on other chains, too. Right?
00:22:15.492 - 00:22:17.444, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, like, it's gamed everywhere.
00:22:17.564 - 00:22:40.912, Speaker D: It's gamed everywhere. And it was, like, created, like, you know, it was like, what, saber, which is effectively, like, curve. Right. And then sunny was effectively, like, convex. I think the difference is that it was just built by one team of people instead of multiple teams. I don't necessarily see that being. Yeah, created a lot of TVL.
00:22:40.912 - 00:23:29.854, Speaker D: But this isn't just a Solana thing. There's all these circular sharing leverage mechanisms across all these ecosystems that help boost TVL. I think that the TVL metric is like, hey, this is the premier metric for DeFi, is a bit off. I think when you have a chain that a lot of the trading activity, at least prior to FTX Alameda, was order book based. Those are just more efficient systems than an ammo for exchanging of assets. You know, TVL can be lower because a lot of the volume or training activity does go through order books because it's just more capitally efficient. Right.
00:23:29.854 - 00:24:07.226, Speaker D: And so I think that, you know, if you really want to look at how healthy a Defi ecosystem is, you need to look at metrics like what Ben Spirango put out, like velocity, defi velocity for dollars that are on chain. I think, you know, there's a lot of metrics in regards to costs per trade, right. That are important for a DeFi ecosystem. Like what is my price impact per block of size, right. Like $1,000. Right. And I think that those are really important metrics to look at.
00:24:07.226 - 00:24:55.530, Speaker D: And they'll still be a little different, right. Because maybe like an order book doesn't have a million dollars of liquidity on it immediately or it could, couldn't. Like if you wanted to place like a million dollar market buy on an order book, that might not, you might have like a lot of price impact, but if you are doing it in chunks or place a limit order, right, there's a lot of capital that's on the sideline that, you know, these market makers do have that are going to come in when their order gets lifted off the book to replace that. And again, like maintain this, you know, healthy cost per trade, right. And I think that those are like more important metrics than TVL. I do think TVL is an important one and I think, unfortunately, it is like what everybody defaults to. So you do need to have like a relatively strong TVL.
00:24:55.530 - 00:25:05.490, Speaker D: But I think for defi activities, there are better ways to quantify the health of an ecosystem as opposed to just looking at TVL.
00:25:05.602 - 00:25:36.350, Speaker C: Yeah, it's actually a very good point you brought up here, which is pre FTX, at least, solanovs mostly being driven through on chain order books. And those are by nature capitally efficient, which means they necessarily wouldnt inflate the tv all the way. Something like an amm, which is not capital efficient at all would, I think thats a very, I think, underappreciated point, David. We were just talking about this actually, this kind of dynamic between central limit order books, we call them clubs, and amms.
00:25:36.502 - 00:26:15.044, Speaker B: Yeah, we pulled earlier the information that you were talking about, about defi velocity. And as you say, Solana came up to about 1.83 and something like Tron, which has maybe the third or fourth highest TVL, has 0.01 as the ratio. So I think TVL as a loan metric, it does miss this sort of aspect of, well, how much is that capital actually being used and therefore how much yield can you actually expect to receive deploying on certain networks? And I'm sure that Solana's cheap fees is part of the reason why we're seeing so much velocity with the DeFi.
00:26:15.164 - 00:26:18.980, Speaker C: How did you calculate that, was that just TVL over 24 hours volume?
00:26:19.092 - 00:26:30.978, Speaker B: Yeah, the way Ben had done it was on 24 hours and seven day volume. So I think he just went on DeFi llama and just did that simple calculation of volume trade volume versus tvl.
00:26:31.116 - 00:26:52.118, Speaker C: Just scrolling through on. I'm on DeFi llama right now. It's like Solana is at $42 million for 24 hours volume. You go up to rank eleven Defi chains, 3 million, then 3 million on kronos, 2 million on mixin, then Phantom is the next one that's in that ballpark with 33 million. But I don't know. I think that's an interesting way to look at it, too. Sorry.
00:26:52.118 - 00:26:53.638, Speaker C: Sorry for the sidebar there.
00:26:53.806 - 00:26:54.350, Speaker D: Oh, no.
00:26:54.422 - 00:27:11.718, Speaker B: And you were just touching upon this, Barrett, but maybe it'd be good for the listeners if you could just go through the differences between an AMM versus a club versus a Cl am. Yeah. And where you see the direction, really, of trading going forwards.
00:27:11.806 - 00:27:49.166, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll start with an AmM because I think that that's like the most familiar for people. An Amm is just a mechanism for exchange where retail or individuals can passively provide liquidity on like a trading pair. So Sol USD, for example, they're going to deposit both sides of this asset into a pool, and then people can come and trade against that pool. Right. They can buy and sell into it. And the liquidity providers, the people that are depositing the assets into the pool, earn some fees from trading fees and sometimes token incentive as well for being in that pool. Right.
00:27:49.166 - 00:28:43.548, Speaker D: Clmms are just like an extension on top of an ammo with concentrated liquidity. So you can set bounds where you're going to be actually providing that liquidity. So it's a little bit more efficient, a little bit better of a mechanism. You still have a ton of extra TVL that isn't really being utilized all the time. But the mechanism is very much similar to that of an amm and an order book or clob, which just stands for central limit order book, or I think now is becoming a D lab, a decentralized limit order book. And that is kind of like the traditional mechanism of exchange in tradfi on the Nasdaq, CME, etcetera, where you have people quoting or placing orders to a book. Right.
00:28:43.548 - 00:29:10.470, Speaker D: But what a book is, is just like there are people that are trying to buy assets and there are people trying to sell assets, and then when you cross the spread, so if you're trying to, like, buy and you hit the lowest ask, right. Your order gets filled. Or if you like, place a limit order. It just sits on the book. Price moves. It can get filled that way and that allows you to take no price impact. Right? Like you're like, hey, I set my own price.
00:29:10.470 - 00:29:45.218, Speaker D: If it doesn't get hit, it doesn't get hit. If it gets hit, I get filled at the price that I wanted to buy at. Right. Which I think is the way in which you are going to attract a lot of these large traditional institutions because it is a mechanism that is familiar with them, that's how they interact today. So it makes sense that this is how you'll kind of see this big volume in TVL, kind of make it on chain. Right. I also am biased, obviously, given my background.
00:29:45.218 - 00:30:21.622, Speaker D: And building on Solana was like, it's fast, it's cheap, they have a club. Great. And so I came to build on Solana because it was fast and cheap and there was an order book already built that was on chain. And then on the amm side of things, as an LP, this is become more of a topic in the last, I don't know, what, six months or so about how it's not very profitable to be an LP. Right. So if you're a retail person being an LP, you're not actually making money. And other people have different views.
00:30:21.622 - 00:30:29.190, Speaker D: Right. But the data shows that you're in fact, like losing money on average being an LP. Right.
00:30:29.262 - 00:30:33.394, Speaker C: Just to clarify, you're referring to liquidity providers for amms.
00:30:33.534 - 00:30:33.930, Speaker D: Correct.
00:30:34.002 - 00:30:45.794, Speaker C: For providing capital for the pool. Right, right. And you're saying it's, they're, they're not, they're not making. They might be making money in absolute terms of fees, but you're referring to, like, impermanent loss in terms of, like, the economic profits over time.
00:30:45.914 - 00:31:53.692, Speaker D: Correct? Correct. And I think that that's like the real important metric, right. Is you need to be like, am I making money based off of what I am, like, providing for this pool? And so that alone makes me sway towards like, an order book being a better mechanism of exchange. Although amms do have their own benefit. Right? Like for long tail assets that might not have, like people interested in market making on an order book. And Amm is still kind of like your, your go to for that, right? Like if you're launching a brand new token, an Amm is like, great way to get started because you can have people like passive provide, but as like, it scales, it makes less sense to use amms over order books. And I think there are some interesting mechanisms coming out for people being able to deposit into these mechanisms that are managing trading on an order book so you can treat it like a vault effectively, which means that you deposit the assets.
00:31:53.692 - 00:32:34.180, Speaker D: This vault will then go place trades and remove trades in real time on the order book. And I think that that is a good way to help build liquidity for these longer tail assets on an order book. While I believe like being better for more profitable for those liquidity providers to this like vault mechanism as opposed to being on an amm. Right. Because on the clmms as well. If price moves out of your range and you don't update it, you can be very great. You can have great impact on what just happened, on your profitability.
00:32:34.180 - 00:33:02.240, Speaker D: And they have some really cool things, vaults for that as well. But again, it's still tied to it being an amm. And the majority of flow on an ammo is just toxic takers or toxic flow in the sense that there is some arbitrage of going. This is an out of priced asset. Im going to come in or buy and sell to be profitable on my side and lp's just have to eat those losses.
00:33:02.352 - 00:33:25.084, Speaker C: Gotcha. Gotcha. I want to summarize some of the points we made for the listener as we dive into this very technical topic here. I think one thing thats clear is theres a few buckets in terms of the design space for trading on blockchains or off chain. There's binance and coinbase. Those are centralized exchanges and that's pretty much how traffic works. They have their own order books.
00:33:25.084 - 00:34:04.298, Speaker C: They're scalable and they're capital efficient, but there's no decentralization. They're not on chain. That's why Defi exists. One thing we talked about initially was the AMM model, which are scalable and decentralized, but not capital efficient at all. Then there's this other bucket where you have on chain clubs or clmms which are decentralized and capital efficient but perhaps not scalable kind of high level. This tends to be where the debate around all three of these approaches falls into. And one question I had with regards to that is with the emergence of things like Uniswap v three and the concentrated liquidity, which we've touched on a bit in this conversation we just had.
00:34:04.298 - 00:34:17.762, Speaker C: Can you help us? And the listener elaborate and hone in on why central limit order books on chain are still superior perhaps to that model that Uniswap v three is pushing and these other kind of iterations on top of the AMM model.
00:34:17.858 - 00:35:35.910, Speaker D: Yeah, of course, even on Uniswap v three, like LP or being a liquidity provider, right, and setting these bands in which you will willing to quote at, you're still losing money as an LP, right? On average. And so I think that that is like the biggest reason that an order book remains supreme as a trading mechanism, at least for the assets that are doing a lot of volume, like your majors, right. And even like your top Defi tokens outside of that as well. And I think that again, as you have more sophisticated traders coming on, you will see that amms, clmms in particular, because that's, I think where it's going, are still not profitable for an LP as these tradfi groups, these quantitative hedge funds come on and they go, this is free money, why am I not going to take this free money? And so I think that on that alone you'll see more volume kind of move towards the order book and these mechanisms that are enabling everyday users to quote passively on an order book and deploy these automated trading strategies.
00:35:36.062 - 00:35:46.414, Speaker B: Do you think it's any different with these oracle style Dexs popularized by GMX? Are the LP still losing money? Is it still full of toxic order flow?
00:35:46.574 - 00:37:23.328, Speaker D: I haven't done enough research on the profitability of LP's on like these oracle based dexs, like GMX, for example. I do believe that there are definitely arbitrage opportunities because it's an oracle. If you can get the oracle update before it is transferred to the Dex, then yes, I think from a size wise and a volume it's hard to scale those because your LP's are taking short positions, right. And I think we've seen on a number of these forks and maybe GMX included, that there comes a point in time where people can't really open up trades anymore because the OI is reached its capacity as like LP's are taking the short side, right. And that doesn't really happen on like a traditional order book. I think those models are really interesting and really exciting for retail who are like, yeah, like I'm going to trade thousands of dollars, maybe a million dollars, right. But when you start to like deploy or people are deploying really like a lot of size into them, then you run into those constraints of those mechanisms themselves or like the risk that it poses when somebody has a mass like $50 million on one of those like Oracle based dexs, and what happens when they become very profitable and then we'll see how that really impacts those systems.
00:37:23.328 - 00:37:43.360, Speaker D: I think that for small size, it's really, really cool. Really interesting. You can get pretty high leverage on those. But I still think for large trading operations, if you want to replace a centralized exchange, it'll be very hard to do it on a zero slippage. Oracle based Dex.
00:37:43.552 - 00:38:33.136, Speaker B: You're almost relying upon pricing from another venue, aren't you? So you can't really replace a sex because you need a centralized exchange, or you need some sort of driver of price to tell you what it should be. I saw a tweet from yourself, actually, the other day where you said, no centralized exchange is safe, and we're going to see a mass migration of volume and capital to on chain trading venues. And I believe that you consider Solana to be one of the obvious locations for that. Do you want to just go more into that? And ideally, about the difference between a centralized exchange order book and what can be achieved on a decentralized exchange on Solana, for example?
00:38:33.240 - 00:39:13.286, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, like, the biggest. The order book operates the same way, right? Except for it's on chain. That means that the big difference is if you're trading on an order book that's on chain, it's self custody, which I think is the beautiful and beneficial thing of DeFi. Right. Is it is self custody, and you can't have, you know, what happened with, like, FTX or Sam defrauded everybody and took everybody's money. And I think that that's, like, the really big advantage of these decentralized exchanges, also the access to the global population. Right.
00:39:13.286 - 00:39:49.770, Speaker D: I think on these centralized exchanges, there's a lot of geography based limitations. But when your application sits on a blockchain, theoretically, you have access to anybody that is using that chain, whether they're in Southeast Asia, the United States, South America, everybody can participate in that system and really make a global financial market happen, which I think is the most exciting thing and one of the biggest advantages of these decentralized order books.
00:39:49.922 - 00:40:42.664, Speaker C: Right. I think that's a good point. I think one other sort of takeaway from that tweet, which it seems to be implying here that Solana is kind of the heir to the Iron Throne, so to speak, for this maybe sex activity that will leave centralized exchanges, especially post FTX and post realizing all the dangers of custodial based exchanges. My question, though, is Solana is in this weird rut right now, where there's not a ton of liquidity in Defi compared to other chains, obviously not a ton of TVL. And so it doesn't, at least on the server, it doesn't seem like it's quite ready to absorb billions and billions of dollars of activity overnight. So how do you see this kind of transfer of power almost where, yes, the tech is good enough, it's fast enough, and there's a lot of cool primitives. Central limit order books on chain, ready to take the mantle.
00:40:42.664 - 00:40:45.104, Speaker C: But how do you see this playing out over time? Tactically?
00:40:45.224 - 00:41:56.688, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think, like, with the migration, right, you'll have people taking their liquidity and moving it on chain, right? So as of today, maybe it can't support, you know, binance activity, but as trading groups and traders move their liquidity on chain, it will naturally pick up, volume will pick up, and it then creates that, that flywheel effect where it's like, okay, like, hey, now I'm a bigger hedge fund. The smaller ones made the leap already. I can now make it to this chain to start to trade. I think that is how it happens because there's a lot of teams doing a lot of work right now, bringing small to even some large market makers into the Solana ecosystem to help prepare for this migration. That I see. I think a lot of other people also would agree, maybe not with it all going or a lot of it going to Solana, but at least on chain, and I think that's, like, the biggest factor in how you're going to build that liquidity base. I think also these groups are going to look for places with order books that mimic the centralized exchange.
00:41:56.688 - 00:42:34.702, Speaker D: They have to do a lot less for changing their tech stack to start trading somewhere. And if you can support an order book, you're on higher ground for attracting these traders that are going to be leaving these centralized exchanges to try and quote, in defi. I think that that's the big draw, is that the infrastructure and primitives are there to make the transition as easy as possible for these groups. They have to change less for how they quote their pricing models as opposed to going and trading on zero slippage or amms.
00:42:34.758 - 00:42:58.344, Speaker C: Right, right. I think this is actually a good segue to talk a bit, because you mentioned bringing on market makers over time to your work. Actually, as the founder of Cypher, can you talk to us a bit about what is Cypher? What was the initial vision? Because as I understand it, it's changed since you guys did a fundraising round in 2021 and versus where you're at today. Give us a bit on the story of that.
00:42:58.454 - 00:43:50.894, Speaker D: So Cypher originally started as a Dex for pre IPO assets. One of the really awesome ethos of DeFi is access to financial markets for everybody. And obviously private capital markets are very much excluded for people. It's very, very tiny percentage of the population that can actually invest in this asset class. And so we originally were like, okay, let's build a Dex for enabling people to gain exposure to these assets. Now, they wouldn't have the underlying itself, but they would have that exposure to the price of these, of these private companies. And I thought that that was a perfect fit for DeFi.
00:43:50.894 - 00:44:45.034, Speaker D: We ended up making pivots for one reason or the other to kind of like where we are today. And I think a lot of that had to do with seeing the liquidity fragmentation of DeFi. You typically go to one venue to trade perps, another venue to trade options, spot, et cetera. And if DeFi really wants to compete on the global stage against traditional markets or even centralized exchanges in crypto, you need venues that can enable trading of all of these asset types at once. That's what Cypher has evolved into over a couple of iterations and so on. Cypher, you can trade spot assets, you can trade perps in the future. It's already on main net, but we just haven't turned it on dated futures options.
00:44:45.034 - 00:45:43.326, Speaker D: We natively support borrow lending. So it's this like a one stop shop super app for all your defi needs. And that is to kind of help bring liquidity together, unify that liquidity, but also provide a place where, whether you're a retail individual or a trading shop, you can manage a sophisticated portfolio from one venue and maintain capital efficiency, which I think is like the biggest piece that DeFi struggles with is that capital efficiency. And now, since Cypher supports cross margining, you can have all of these assets, manage all these assets in a particular venue, which improves your capital efficiency, which means spreads can be tighter, you can have more volume, more users borrow lending, and applications can then be built on top of cyphers infrastructure to utilize everything that has been built.
00:45:43.390 - 00:46:13.986, Speaker C: Right, gotcha. So certainly a lot to unpack there. Super cool platform. I think one point I want to hone in on here is it sounds like, and you already said it, but cypher is a bit of a super app for DeFi, where traders can express certain views on assets, whether through spot or options markets, and do the borrow land inside the same venue. And you have almost economies of scale here where you can now do things like cross margining. Can you dive a bit deeper into that? Why is that so crucial for the end user and broadly better for Defi? And how does that work?
00:46:14.130 - 00:46:44.678, Speaker D: So, enabling the trading of a number of different financial instruments allows for more capital efficiency. And what I mean by that is that these market makers, a lot of the time are delta neutral trading shops where they are, you know, trading one market, offloading risk into another market. Right. So we could use like, perps and spot, for example. Right. Like a market maker is market making perps or spot, you know, depends on which one that they, or both. Right.
00:46:44.678 - 00:47:23.204, Speaker D: And they fill an order on the perps book that reduces their capital efficiency until they offload that risk. Right. And traditionally, you're kind of doing it across a couple different venues. So you're getting filled on perps on one venue. You have to manage that margining system over there, and then you're offloading risk into another venue. And those don't talk to one another. Once you offload a risk and have become delta neutral, you still aren't benefiting from that capital efficiency where then you can take that capital and use it again.
00:47:23.204 - 00:48:34.084, Speaker D: That's one of the big unlocks that I think Solana enables in what cyber is core principles are built around is now that you can trade all these assets, classes offload risk. The system understands that you have offloaded that risk and users get their capital back because they have either sold an asset or bought it back. Their margin is then increased again because the risk has been mitigated. And I think that that enables more. Unlike this DeFi velocity thing that Ben has tweeted about, dollars go farther, and that enables market makers to quote tighter spreads when they're able to benefit from that capital efficiency in one system. What that means is that users who aren't market making are benefiting from better execution prices. And there's the flywheel that begins with that kind of fundamental capital efficiency in margining that I think is really beneficial and can help defi scale to reach these centralized exchange volumes.
00:48:34.084 - 00:49:02.762, Speaker D: There are some centralized exchanges that offer 1000 x leverage, and I don't know, and some DeFi apps enable that. Right. But I think that you don't necessarily need that much margin or leverage to achieve the goals of capital efficiency to build an incredibly robust and healthy ecosystem. And I think that that's kind of the goal of cypher and why we have structured our protocol the way it is.
00:49:02.898 - 00:49:33.240, Speaker B: So, just to summarize, see if I understand correctly, but you're saying previously, most programs, if you're going to go long on one application and go short elsewhere, it's not going to realize that you're actually delta neutral and that you should be able to redeploy capital. But with Cypher it would allow you to do that. Can you just clarify, do you have to use cypher products to achieve that? Or can you be using other applications, for example drift, and it will still know that you're delta neutral. How does that work?
00:49:33.372 - 00:50:35.482, Speaker D: So it is contained to cyphers ecosystem currently due to the margining like margin accounts. Ciphers protocol maintains a margin account and if the assets are not held in the margin account, the system cannot guarantee that you're in fact delta neutral. Now. Not to say that in the future it can't be done, but at least in this iteration it does contain two cipher's ecosystem itself. Although our spot markets are open book, which means that it does share with a number of different applications and unifies that kind of like spot liquidity. Also Phoenix released recently and our team is working on integrating Phoenix because I think that they have some really awesome infrastructure being like a crankless order book as opposed to open book being. You have to crank it to continuously settle those trades on those markets.
00:50:35.482 - 00:51:48.734, Speaker D: That's the big benefit is that unified spot layer, which is typically where a lot of people are going to be offloading risk into. And so that's where we started. And with everything else on the derivative side, that is definitely cipher native order books. But in the future we're looking at integrating or we're working on an integration for Jupyter which enables even more access to liquidity. Because they do integrate with amms that are not necessarily integrated with Openbook, you can have better spreads and offloading risk allows again that tighter and liquidity flywheel to take it back would be definitely something that we're interested in figuring out is how do you enable delta neutral for derivatives on platforms that are not cipher? I think that it's feasible. I know teams that are working on it right now. We're definitely excited to get to that where maybe there's another protocol on top of cypher that has its own margining system that ties into a lot of dexs and Cypher can be one of those.
00:51:48.734 - 00:51:54.330, Speaker D: And I think that's the beautiful thing about composability defi being building blocks.
00:51:54.442 - 00:52:37.798, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly what I was just about to come onto. Because firstly I thought maybe marginfi was building on top of various dexs and allowing for this realization that you're in a delta neutral position across different protocols. So it'd be interesting to see how that progresses. But I mean, I mean, the overriding message I'm getting here is the composability of building on Solana. And I just want to compare that to, for example, DyDx's decision to move to an app chain on the cosmos ecosystem. What do you think of the benefits? Is it that loss of composability, which is the main detriment? What are your views on going app chain versus building on a general purpose blockchain like Solana?
00:52:37.946 - 00:53:47.748, Speaker D: I think composability is a big thing for that. Right. Although I'm not 100% positive on what you can do on dy DX's app chain. Like, can there be another protocol built on their app chain to utilize DyDx liquidity? I'm unsure about that. I do think that there are some things in the cosmos ecosystem where you can have composability between app chains. But I think having a universal layer that can scale on its own to support a ton of different things, whether that be gaming, nfts, defi, and a lot of different applications, I think you have better access to liquidity, more assets, and it makes composability a lot easier. And so I personally am more enticed to build on a chain that kind of can support all of those and still scale, as opposed to going and building my own app chain, because I think that there are a lot of liquidity flywheels and composability benefits that come with being on a layer, one that can scale to support that type of volume.
00:53:47.876 - 00:54:34.490, Speaker C: Yeah, said differently, but similar point we're making here is, let's call them purpose built layer ones for Defi, like Psy Kanto, where they kind of have as a core primitive to the layer one and order book type mechanism. I'm not an expert on these, but certainly there's a lot of conversation around those ecosystems. Perhaps what I think these other approaches are missing is the liquidity flywheel benefits of having robust ecosystems that are not strictly defi. For instance, Stepn, which drove all time highs in orcas volume and caused them to make their own Dex. We brought gaming earlier, even NFTs and NFT fi. And the intersection of those two that I think enriches Defi indirectly. And we can also get into Dao is dao tooling.
00:54:34.490 - 00:54:57.324, Speaker C: Right? But I think the point is, like, Solana has this kind of rich tapestry of ancillary ecosystems in crypto that at the end of the day, everybody needs to move money around. And having powerful defi primitives, plus these ecosystems on one monolithic layer that's composable, kind of guarantees interesting use cases and widens the design space in a way that I haven't quite seen in other ecosystems.
00:54:57.784 - 00:56:01.204, Speaker D: Yeah, 100% agree with that. And it'll definitely be very exciting to see these bigger projects migrate onto Solana like helium. They bring a ton of tokens from their ecosystem. And I know that there's a couple other things that are going on that I can't talk about, but definitely, or like Hivemapper, for example. There's a lot of these very large scale, not DeFi focused applications that are bringing a lot of tokens, a lot of users, a lot of volume step in being like the original one, I think, that are going to really benefit the DeFi ecosystem in Solana. And I think one of the original pioneers of this was Defi land, which was the little game that was like, oh, I have, it's like Farmville, but DeFi, where you're actually liquidity mining by doing things right, and there's a lot of really cool mechanisms that you can build because of what you just mentioned on having this monolithic layer that can support all these types of protocols and projects.
00:56:06.424 - 00:56:31.514, Speaker C: So we talked a lot about maybe the supply side of cypher, like what market makers want and how they can express different views they want to take and make their business more viable. What about the other side, like user growth? What we're seeing in L2s, especially these days, is airdrop farming and incentivizing with tokens. Whereas maybe we haven't seen as much of this, at least I haven't seen as much of this on Solana. Do you have a view on why that's the case?
00:56:31.894 - 00:57:18.316, Speaker D: I think we didn't see that all that much on Solana because the first, like DeFi 1.0 on Solana came about in a bull market. People were able to just perform. Idos have very successful idos. There was a lot of liquidity here, right? And also it was in a bull market where it was pretty detrimental to use a chain that was with a mempool, that has dynamic base fees in the sense that it can get very expensive to transact. And if you want to move in and out of positions, it wasn't really the place to be. And that's like, Solana boomed over that.
00:57:18.316 - 00:58:11.326, Speaker D: And I think that that will happen again. When we start to see it become incredibly. As gas fees increase and people are outbidding you, people will again migrate to these l one s that are performant and have incredibly low fees. L two s, I think, will also see a big boost on that front. And I think that now, after being through like a cycle on Solana, there are going to be, you're going to see airdrops coming here in the near term. I mean, we've already seen stuff come out from tensor, right. And I think that there are more protocols that are going to, that don't have tokens currently, which is a ton of, like, Solana Defi, actually, that are going to be participating in these mechanisms because it is a great way to attract users.
00:58:11.326 - 00:59:02.104, Speaker D: Right. You know, on Solana, it was a lot of, like, liquidity mining incentives, which aren't like airdrops per se, but, you know, they help bring, users bring liquidity, and now it's in the depths of a bear market. Macroeconomics is, you know, that environment is not necessarily super appealing. Treasuries are earning better yields than a lot of on chain lending for stable coins. You have to be creative and props to the arbitrum ecosystem for participating and really giving out a lot of airdrops, a lot of free money, and people want free money. So I think that that's going to be something that is over the next two quarters on Solana, you're going to see a lot more of that. I know teams that are going to, that are working on how they're going to do their airdrops.
00:59:02.104 - 00:59:42.696, Speaker D: I know there are some other individuals that are going to be helping airdrops to the ecosystem that are not necessarily like protocols, which I think is good as well, to just bring more excitement, more trading volume and more users to the ecosystem. So I think that there's like, and that kind of goes into, like, how are you going to attract these firms coming from centralized exchanges, is these airdrops that are very popular in a lot of the private and alpha chats across the ecosystem. So excited to see who's going to go, who's going to go first. And the excitement that's going to be.
00:59:42.720 - 00:59:45.440, Speaker C: Built around that airdrop season around the corner.
00:59:45.632 - 01:00:45.202, Speaker B: It's super exciting because it just creates so much goodwill, doesn't it, around not just that Defi application, but the whole of the chain, really. There's this flywheel effect that comes about because some could argue, but the TVL would just move from one protocol to next. But I think the difference between, you mentioned arbitrum earlier, they're going to be having airdrop hunters going across all of those different l two s, fragmenting the liquidity, whereas on Solana, it's all staying on Solana. So maybe they're moving from application to application, but hopefully they'll create this flywheel effect where the TVL is increasing as more and more people are searching for those airdrops just to pivot onto fees for the moment. I mean, a lot of people say the fees are too cheap on Solana, but do you have any thoughts on that? And for example, what level of fees are required if we're going to have this club on chain? What sort of fees can these market makers stomach?
01:00:45.358 - 01:01:29.066, Speaker D: I think there's a lot of opinions on this. My personal opinion is that you can't really increase base fee much at all. I think that you want to be competitive with a centralized exchange, and it's incredibly cheap to quote on a centralized exchange if you're canceling orders, placing orders every slot, because prices are moving, right. That can get expensive. And these market makers will shy away from a chain that has higher base fees, especially when they're on the HFT side of things. Right. And so I think that that's something like, really important to pay attention to.
01:01:29.066 - 01:03:00.474, Speaker D: The real way for Solana to become like, you know, profitable for its validators is to have a blossoming defi ecosystem, right. The priority fees for making it into a block and the rise of Jito's client being able to receive benefits from searchers as they tip, those are going to generate a lot more revenue for validators as opposed to just increasing the base fee. I would make the argument that if you're, if priority fees and MEV payments do not make validators profitable, increasing a base fee is not going to do it either. I think that the real way is to create the flywheels and have a DeFi ecosystem that can compete with these big centralized exchanges and tradfi groups on volume, because they will inherently benefit more from MEV in priority fees than a increase in the base fee. So I'm on the side of the argument where we shouldn't increase base fee at all because it limits the attractive, it reduces the attractiveness for quoting on chain. And I think that the order book, again, is the biggest way to bring the most liquidity, the most volume, the biggest defi ecosystem into the blockchain space. That's how I think about it.
01:03:00.474 - 01:03:42.744, Speaker D: There are definitely people that are going to disagree. Validators are going to be like, yo, I want that base fee. But I think that over time it will be more beneficial to not increase the base fee and have priority fees and net payments take the work of that profitability and revenue stream. And now from that, there are obviously net payments and priority fees are volatility dependent. And you don't necessarily want incredibly volatile markets either. Like crypto is just more volatile in general, at least for the time being. It's still low liquidity, comparative to traffic markets.
01:03:42.744 - 01:04:52.268, Speaker D: Right. But you can then create financial products for validators, or they can utilize primitives that are already built to hedge their operational expenditures and revenue. Just like a commercial agricultural group hedges their corn, they sell dated futures. You can do the same. You could even have some pretty cool things that we've done a little bit of research on, where you have kind of like almost like a swap in the sense, but like it would operate more like a dated future where a validator can short sell their rewards for the future. Somebody can, you know, buy those in USDC and that kind of like helps them guarantee some, like, revenue stream. Obviously, they're going to sell most likely below market price, but they have a predictable revenue stream in that way as MeV and priority fees will fluctuate throughout the year, naturally.
01:04:52.396 - 01:05:24.644, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. And yeah, I think if Solana is going to become a thriving l one, DeFi is crucial to that. And having low fees, currently the lowest in the industry, would help to attract these market makers. I think the one point id push back on, potentially is the base fees. So different transactions use up different levels of compute units. They're called on Solana. Solana has a limit by which how much they can compute basically every single block.
01:05:24.644 - 01:05:53.940, Speaker B: So I know that at the moment there's discussions around, well, we should maybe tax these more compute heavy transactions, and a lot of those are mev type transactions. To me, there's some sense to that, because otherwise everyone just fills these blocks with these very computationally heavy meth transactions. But I'm completely in agreement as well that DeFi needs to flourish and you need these super low fees in order to compete, really with the centralized exchanges.
01:05:54.052 - 01:06:44.424, Speaker D: Yeah, and I generally agree with that. I do think that if you add additional tax on compute, and maybe this gets solved with runtime v two. Right. But the more CPI's you do, which is across program invocations, your computer's gonna go up, which means that you're going to tax these applications that are building very complex systems, that are going to be able to be the ones that are competing with your centralized exchange changes. Right. And so if you're a cross margining solution and you're across a number of different dexes, they're going to get taxed more. But those are also the protocols that are providing the most benefit to bringing a lot of this volume and liquidity to Solana.
01:06:44.424 - 01:07:13.354, Speaker D: I think that there's a lot more discussion to be had on that topic, I definitely think it is interesting and I think that in the right way it could work. But I would be at least initially like a little concerned on like, the impacts it has on complex financial protocols that I do see being the way that you're going to help bridge the gap between the on chain and off chain markets.
01:07:19.874 - 01:08:16.006, Speaker C: So we did a lot of discussion here on the base level of Defi. What's happening at the protocol level for all these different applications and stakeholders. But one question I always ask myself, and like to ask builders, especially in DeFi, is how do we think the user experience is going to shake out over time? Right? Like right now, you know, we're aping into coins straight up on Jupiter or something like uniswap or at the aggregator level. But over time I have this thesis that these protocols get pushed down the stack and commoditized and fees kind of trend, maybe not necessarily to zero, but certainly trend downwards with increased competition, and you roll up into what people use to do these transactions. Maybe it's even just looking at the fact that Metamask made a ton of money adding a massive 85 bit spread all in wallet swaps, it's interesting to see that dynamic play out. How do you see the user experience playing out? Who's going to actually collect the rent, so to speak? At the end of the day, I.
01:08:16.030 - 01:09:37.948, Speaker D: Think you will see a lot of fees go lower and lower and lower. I think that it will be kind of on how you interact with a protocol where maybe you're a liquidity provider or on an order book based protocol, a market maker where you're earning rebates from the system itself. And the protocol does pick up less and less. But there are the flywheels of scale that come into play, that if you're picking up a couple pennies a dollar depends on the size of the trade, multiple dollars. That volume game is really how you're going to make money. And that's the thesis behind the swaps in metamask, I think also applications that control risk will be able to maintain higher fees because of those reasons, that they provide more capital, efficiency. So protocols that have leverage, they will always be able to kind of have higher fees than something like an Amm or kind of like the base level order book because they are providing a service that has risk, such as leverage trading.
01:09:37.948 - 01:10:30.462, Speaker D: And so I think that the more complex applications will be able to kind of take a little bit more on that side. Obviously it will go down over time, but they will still, the higher you are in the stack. And your user archetypes are going to depend on how much fees you can generate as a protocol. And I think that there's a lot of good incentives that can be done with the native token for a protocol to help reduce those cypher when its token goes live. You'll be able to hold cipe token in your margin account to reduce fees. You can get to that rebate level or almost zero level of fees anyway by holding the token. And that's a good utility for a lot of these trading protocols to get that access.
01:10:30.462 - 01:11:24.078, Speaker D: And those retail individuals benefit from that. Maybe they are paying a higher fee because they don't hold a ton of the token, but they benefit from the flywheel that that creates where spreads can be tighter. So their order, their execution prices are generally just better and that provides a better ux for them. I think it'll be really interesting to see know how applications are interacted with. I think the rise of wallets doing swaps, they're not really on the leverage side of things or perpetuals or like the derivative contracts yet, but maybe that happens in the future. I think backpack and Xnfts are going to be really exciting and how it's like building the app store. Right? And so I think that it'll be interesting to see how these protocols are interacted with.
01:11:24.078 - 01:12:36.952, Speaker D: Defi land was a game that interacted with DeFi protocols, and that's a complete abstraction. And so it'll be really cool, I think, to watch how users really interact. I think that for trading, it will always be some sort of trading interface, whether that is a wallet, whether that is an ex NFT, whether that is a front end directly on top of like the underlying protocol, or maybe multiple abstractions. Right. But I think that it'll be very exciting to see it all play out, especially with some of the stuff that, you know, the, the teams that are building currently, like, you know, backpack and Armani. And then I think even runtimev two goes a step further on what can be done, because at that point you have unlimited, I mean, not necessarily unlimited because there's like a transaction size limit, but the composability aspect goes exponentially up because of how you can use a CPI to call just a function of a protocol. And it operates much more like the move vms do on Aptos and suI.
01:12:36.952 - 01:12:58.530, Speaker D: And I think that there's a lot of really cool interfaces and interactions that will derive from that new unlock of compute resources and composability because of this current CPI depth is, I believe four, again, runtime v two, it becomes effect theoretically unlimited. Right?
01:12:58.642 - 01:13:55.714, Speaker C: Kind of like related to that point, because I see two major headwinds broadly to defi adoption, certainly at least for retail users. One is just making the user experience better, not having them go to five different websites to do borrow over lend trading options, which actually seems like cypher solves a lot of that by in housing those functions in one interface and giving the user those economies of scale. But related to that though, is in order to truly replace, let's call it tradfi, we need to start letting people take credit. Credit under collateralized. And I wonder, like, how does this really shake out over time? How do we actually solve this? Like, it seems to me, part of the issue is just this idea of how do you figure out identity on chain and attribute actions to a human being and then use those actions to evaluate creditworthiness. I'd be curious to hear from your perspective as a builder in defi, like, how do you see this playing out over time?
01:13:55.834 - 01:14:43.290, Speaker D: I think initially that will come from on ramping solutions just being better. They're on ramping, you can do things with, you can buy crypto with a credit card, and that's effectively under collateralized lending to an extent. And I think that that will be that first generation of, okay, hey, we can put credit on chain and it does offload the risk from a DeFi protocol to that on ramp. Because once the assets are in some protocol, the assets are there. And I think that's kind of going to be the first way we saw. What is it, maple finance. And I believe it's Credx or Credora.
01:14:43.290 - 01:15:25.116, Speaker D: I get them confused, and that's really bad. But they are also doing kind of like this under collateralized lending or gear. ZK proofs for, I think it's cordora. ZK proofs for showing that a party is in fact good for the money. And I think that as that becomes more scalable, you unlock more and more liquidity flywheels, of course. And I definitely think that real world assets migrating on chain, I think that one is Credx. And so I think that those are going to be exciting ways to unlock a ton of liquidity.
01:15:25.116 - 01:16:09.648, Speaker D: People take liens against their house, not saying that's a good idea or anything, but people do that. But being able to collateralize on chain positions with off chain assets, I think is going to be a major unlock for a ton of liquidity. It's probably to the tune of trillions of dollars. Right. And I think that those building blocks are being tackled by teams currently. And I think that once those get more robust, you'll see kind of like this step up of liquidity that is on chain because of these real world assets and under collateralized lending mechanisms. I think identity is a huge part of that.
01:16:09.648 - 01:17:11.744, Speaker D: Right. And if you can, like, you know, verify that somebody has like a number of different wallets, and so therefore they're good for the money. You know, maybe on the protocol itself, it's under collateralized, but they have some, you know, repo authority or something like that in like a permissionless way to be able to protect themselves if there were, you know, they were to like, move a bunch of assets off chain and no longer can be verified. Right. But I think, you know, as in the next couple of years and on into the future to ten years, you'll be able to have this on chain representation of somebody's total assets that they do have and be able to provide liquidity for that on chain. And maybe that's not for trading, but maybe it's for getting a car loan or something like that. All of that can still be incentivized and utilized by on chain protocols.
01:17:11.744 - 01:17:35.220, Speaker D: Everything that is on chain necessarily won't be decentralized from a governance standpoint. And I think that that's okay. Maybe that's a controversial opinion, but I definitely. There will always be applications that are going to go down a different route than being DeFi and the ethos of DeFi, but provide a lot of benefit to Defi's ecosystem.
01:17:35.332 - 01:18:38.600, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that'd be awesome, wouldn't it? If we can get identity working on chain, especially using zero knowledge proofs, it just feels like it would be such a huge unlock suddenly freeing up all of this credit really, into blockchain. I think the other area, which needs more work is being able to borrow at a fixed rate, which is more complicated than it sounds. And you have to develop these huge interest rate swap markets, highly liquid with massive market makers. So again, I think that's a sort of 510 year project, but if you can suddenly have under collateralized loans at fixed rates of interest, then suddenly you can start talking about buying a house and financing that via Defi rails. So super exciting just to close out. But we saw a tweet, tweet earlier in the week from Mert from Helios Labs, and he said that he's hearing rumors that Solana Defi is coming back much sooner and stronger than you think. Just wondering if you're able to shed any light, any news any alpha on that?
01:18:38.752 - 01:19:33.324, Speaker D: Yeah, so, I mean, we're starting to see an influx of market making groups that are like, hey, we're interested. We want to be on chain. We want to be on an order book. Solana makes a lot of sense to us, and protocols are building in protections for these market makers. Cypher Mango, for example, with tifs, which is that time enforced, which allows you to toss like a timestamp on an order. So if there's a network problem, the blockchain's clock or slots that pass can help prevent that, those orders from getting lifted when chain does resume normal operation. So I definitely think there's a lot of, like, under talked about or quiet features that a lot of these protocols are adding on the risk side of things for making market makers more comfortable to bring more liquidity on chain.
01:19:33.324 - 01:20:25.276, Speaker D: I also think that it goes hand in hand with what I said earlier about airdrop season. I definitely think that you're going to see some teams launching, you know, tokens via airdrops, and I think that that will bring a lot of excitement and activity to the Solana ecosystem and defi in general, as well as ice. Like, the quality of projects here are, you know, people, people stuck through it, through the bear market. Right. And it does seem like the tides are turning a little bit, you know, who knows with macro? But I think there is a lot of positive sentiment around what protocols have been built on the kind of larger side, on the liquidity side of things for market makers and just trading shops in general to be coming back to Solana. And that's the flywheel. You know, it's the chicken and the egg.
01:20:25.276 - 01:21:14.348, Speaker D: Can you get the liquidity for the users? And I think that there's a lot of teams working really hard to get that done. And so I think we'll see, you know, over the next couple months, airdrops, big liquidity coming back, and therefore just attracts more and more users. And there are some, definitely some stealth projects that are coming out that are going to aid that excitement as well. And I think that it goes to show that grizzly Thawne had the most submissions ever, right, in what seems to be the darkest hours for Solana. And people are still here building. And I think that goes to show that this ecosystem isn't rolling over and tossing up their hands and going, all right, it's over. And I think that that resiliency, being able to make it through the ups and downs of markets.
01:21:14.348 - 01:22:21.382, Speaker D: Right. Shows that it's going to be here for the long term and increases people's willingness to come on chain come to Solana because there is less concern that teens are just going to toss their hands up and walk away. Because I don't know how, like, it can get worse. It can always get worse, right? But to make it through network outages, macro environment, FTX, Alameda saga and be here and still have the willingness to trudge on, I think we've seen Ethereum people go, hey, look, they seem like they're going to make it. Even the bankless guys have shown positive sentiment around the Solana ecosystem and its willingness to stay around. And I think that it being probably the next most robust ecosystem to Ethereum and making it through the turbulence that it has, will go a long way as well. And again, there's going to be some fun airdrops coming.
01:22:21.382 - 01:22:33.012, Speaker D: And so I think that DeFi will be back in the not too distant future and everybody will be on the bull train again for Solana ecosystem.
01:22:33.188 - 01:23:04.500, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what's very clear, just from talking to you in this episode and watching the Solana ecosystem power through all of these hurdles over the past year and a half, it's crystal clear that it'd be unwise to bet against Salon Solana at this point. And the risk profile seems almost unbelievably asymmetric here in terms of the upside versus how much farther can we really go down? So amazing way to end this episode on a bullish note for Solana. Indeed.
01:23:04.652 - 01:23:18.620, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there's a ton of excitement, and thank you guys so much for having me on to talk about Solana Defi. I definitely think all the viewers, keep your eyes peeled. It's going to be an exciting couple of quarters. And on and onward.
01:23:18.732 - 01:23:23.812, Speaker C: Awesome. Well, this was another episode of Unlayered with Barrett, founder of Cypher.
01:23:23.908 - 01:23:25.164, Speaker D: Oh, thanks, guys. I had a blast.
