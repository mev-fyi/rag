00:00:14.160 - 00:01:00.398, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the podcast where we explore next generation blockchains. I'm your host, Saul, joined by my co host here, Dave. And today we're going to be diving into the world of liquid staking tokens, chatting with Brandon Tucker, head of communications at Marinade Finance. And for those who are not aware, Marinade is the top liquid staking protocol on Solana, but not just in terms of lsts, but they're actually the top in TVL and all of Solana Defi. If you were to hop on Defi llama today and see the top protocols in terms of TVL, so obviously a very relevant and important protocol, some would say they are considered the lido of Solana. But, you know, funny enough, Lido also is on Solana, so it's a bit confusing there. But regardless, they're an OG in terms of liquid staking and an important primitive in Solana.
00:01:00.398 - 00:01:05.194, Speaker A: And so we're super excited to chat with you today. Brennan, so how's it going?
00:01:05.734 - 00:01:13.854, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Honored to be here in talk all things Solana. It's an exciting fall breakpoint around the corner, for sure.
00:01:13.934 - 00:01:14.478, Speaker A: For sure.
00:01:14.566 - 00:01:43.934, Speaker B: You know, there's. It's what, you know, there's the kind of noise that we hear kind of out, out in the open, and then there's like the DM's and the telegram chats that our team is having with people. And it's like, it's hard not to feel great about all the collaboration happening in the ecosystem. And I think that's really the great part about web3 is just how openly collaborative we can be with teams, really all over the world. So that's really the exciting thing right now. It's definitely builders mode right now, 100%.
00:01:44.054 - 00:02:27.692, Speaker A: And that's something we want to get into a bit later, is kind of what sorts of new initiatives and collaborations you guys are thinking about. But before we actually get into that, I want to start a bit higher level and help our audience understand the emergence of this class of protocol, which is to say the emergence of liquid staking tokens, kind of how they came to be. And it's not unique to Solana. They exist on other proof of stake protocols like Ethereum, so on and so forth. But maybe help us understand kind of the backstory here. Obviously, proof of stake is how we secure blockchains like Solana, and we don't necessarily need lsts. We could just use our Solana itself and just stake that and get a yield and be good to go.
00:02:27.692 - 00:02:38.064, Speaker A: But help us understand kind of why did this protocol, like, marinate or competitors, why did this primitive of liquid staking derivative tokens come to be in the first place?
00:02:39.104 - 00:03:28.994, Speaker B: Sure. Happy to. Yeah, it's, it really is a composable highlight of proof of stake blockchains, this idea of liquid staking tokens. So with proof of stake, of course, you know, you're given these sole tokens on the Solana network, and 70% of sole holders are delegating those tokens to validators, you know, by staking. And so what you're doing is you're selecting a validator, you're delegating the tokens, you're not giving them your tokens, you're delegating them, you retain custody of them. And then what you're basically doing is you're voting for them to get more weight in the consensus and basically more access to leader slots and things like that. So that basically they get to get more transactions and fees that way.
00:03:28.994 - 00:04:00.862, Speaker B: So that's kind of the really simple way to do it. That's how Solana started. There was no liquid staking option. About a year or so into Solana being out, this idea of liquid staking came to Solana and it really started in the 2021 Solana and serum hackathon back in March 2021. And Marinade was actually founded then. It was two teams. They got together and were able to build this liquid staking primitive.
00:04:00.862 - 00:04:50.576, Speaker B: And really what this does is it enables you to access your staked Solana tokens and use it in Defi. So in traditional native staking, I'm delegating my tokens to a validator. I can't do anything with those tokens while they're locked with a validator unless I liquid stake. So liquid stake essentially gives you a collateral token back or a liquid staking token that I'm able to use in defi while my stake is still locked up. So I'm earning the staking rewards that come, and then I'm also able to basically access the staked soul and use it using a collateral token. And in Marinade's case, that's the MSOl token. So it's really a composable highlight in that I'm earning staking rewards each epoch.
00:04:50.576 - 00:05:28.340, Speaker B: And on Solana, an epoch is about two to three days, and the apy of that is about around seven ish percent. It kind of depends on how fast the epochs are and the performance of the pool. But I'm getting those staking rewards, and then with liquid staking, I can take the collateral token. I can deposit it, use it as collateral, borrow against it, maybe go buy nfts with it. I can supply it as liquidity. I can borrow stables with it. Really, its first purpose is as a collateral token and being able to basically access and do things with it without sacrificing the staking rewards.
00:05:28.340 - 00:05:59.618, Speaker B: Because I think what a lot of people on Solana should realize is that there is an inflation schedule on Solana. So if I'm not staking my soul, I'm basically getting diluted. So you should be staking it. But the problem, if you're natively staking it, is that you can't use it. And I think, as we all know, on Solana, if we've been here long enough, we definitely need more liquidity on the chain to kind of drum up activity. So I hope that was a decent Tldr. But am I missing any holes here?
00:05:59.786 - 00:06:50.508, Speaker A: So it makes sense, and I think to summarize a bit here, basically, if you were to stake Solana just straight up, there's an opportunity cost of that capital. If you're just locking it up to a valve data directly, versus if you use a protocol like marinade, you get back MSoL, I believe it's called, which you can then use in various defi protocols. And, yeah, like, to your point, uses collateral, take a loan out, or even swap it, or use it to buy stuff. Here's where I get hung up, and this is specific to Solana, and I'm sure you get this question a lot. Solana has a really high, and you brought it up, 70% staking ratio, meaning 70% of the supply that's circulating is being staked right now. But most other, let's call them blockchains, with a lot of economic activity. Ethereum, I think it's in like the 20 or 30% range.
00:06:50.508 - 00:07:23.844, Speaker A: BNB chain, 14% polygon, 40%. If you were to go into staking rewards, that's kind of what I'm reading off of. So they have lower staking ratios. Solana has a high staking ratio. So it seems like there's, like a lot of pent up demand here on the Solana side to kind of move that capital that's being natively staked and put it into something like a marinade. But why do we see this phenomenon? Why such a high staking ratio in spite of what seems like a very clear and obvious value proposition for using a liquid staking protocol?
00:07:24.864 - 00:08:13.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this has been a discussion that's been happening, like, every week throughout the Defi ecosystem. Like all year long. And it's one of these things where everyone, everyone sees the opportunity here and want to know why isn't, you know, 90% or like 50% or even like 20% of stake, liquid staked. And there's a few answers that we've kind of uncovered, kind of in both research and just discussions with institutions and whales and things like that. Number one, I'll point out that about 60 million Sol is on a locked vesting schedule through early investment grants, things like that. So right there, you have about 60 million that isn't eligible for liquid staking. They can only stake it.
00:08:13.824 - 00:09:16.364, Speaker B: So what a lot of those early investors did is they either started their own validator and just have 100% commission, or they have like a partner that they do a deal with and stake it that way. And so as those unlocks happen, that will be distributed to people who can do whatever they want with those tokens. And I'll mention on that point, we've had like several kind of like, mini dumps over the last couple of months. And something I've noticed, just looking at the charts, is that a lot of the liquid staking protocols, us and others, do seem to get more liquid staking TvL when these dumps happen. So the USD amount might be lower. But what this is telling me is that we're seeing distribution of the token as it should be. And I think all of us who were around when FTX happened, I mean, as brutal as that was, there's hope that these tokens are going to end up more distributed, more widely distributed in the hands of people who know the network and want to be a part of the network.
00:09:16.364 - 00:09:52.726, Speaker B: So that is one element. There's others though, obviously with ETH, the threshold to be a validator is so high at 32, or basically to have your own node is 32 ETH. That's significant. And so for a lot of people, their way to get yield off their ETH is just by using liquid staking tokens. But on salon, it's just a different thing completely. I can stake to somebody with one soul, no problem. And also the liquidity, it's almost like too fast and too easy to get your native soul out.
00:09:52.726 - 00:10:26.960, Speaker B: And this is something we talked about a little bit too. Yeah, is, you know, epochs are two to three days, and I can delay it on stake and get my soul very quickly in two to three days. However, I can also get it out instantly right now, because there's so much unstaked liquidity available. You can use marinade, you can use Jupiter, you can use other places, like you can unstake your soul natively very quickly. They instantly for like 0.1% fees or something. So it's almost too easy.
00:10:26.960 - 00:11:31.458, Speaker B: And then I think the last thing I'll point out that marinate's been talking about too, is there's no slashing yet on Solana. And so we think that if slashing were to come eventually, and really what slashing is, is this idea, if a validator is acting maliciously, they actually get some of their stake burned. And so if I'm staking to a validator who gets slashed, I would actually lose principal stake to that, to that validator. And that might make people feel like they would rather go with stake pools through liquid staking, as opposed to staking like with 1100% commission validator. And I guess also just the epoch time we've considered maybe the epoch time should be longer, or I've even seen, I think Multicoin wrote about this idea of maybe your staking reward should be higher the longer you lock them up for. So like, instead of, you know, this two to three day epoch, if I'm willing to lock it for longer, I get higher staking rewards than people who only lock it for the minimum amount. I don't know if I'm on board with that, but I just know that that's been an idea out there.
00:11:31.458 - 00:12:04.996, Speaker B: So I think all those contribute to it. What I tell people is like, solana is like almost too fast for liquid staking as is. We gotta like, we gotta like figure out some inefficiencies, you know, to get people liquid staking. But, and I think this is the third time I'm gonna say the last thing, but I think the last thing, for real, is that there just needs to be like this deep desire to use the chain. Yeah. Like I need, I can't, like I want to, I want to have a token I need to buy, I need an entity I need to buy. I need these opportunities and strategies that I simply have to be liquid for.
00:12:04.996 - 00:12:19.534, Speaker B: And I think that that's going to happen in the next few months. As more teams launch tokens, hopefully more activity happens, more liquidity comes on chain. Suddenly it just becomes this big playground, and I want to be a part of it, and I need to be liquid to do that.
00:12:19.874 - 00:13:22.414, Speaker C: Can we just touch a bit more on this short epoch time? Because ultimately, when people are staking their soul, they are securing the network. And in, for example, the case of a black swan event, suddenly you might need to sell all of your soul really quickly say the US bans anyone from holding any cryptocurrency whatsoever, suddenly everyone's going to want to sell, and if you're staking, you're going to want to unstake as quickly as you can and sell it straight away. And that's going to make the network less secure. So it seems strange to me that the network is sort of allowing people that really quick exit, when ultimately what they do need is people to hang around and help secure the network, even during times of volatility. So the multicoin piece that you talked about, which they recently released on long term staking, about giving a higher reward to people who stake for longer and a lower reward for people who stake for a shorter period of time, to me it makes some sense, or as you suggested, like extending the epoch. But yeah, why do you think we're not talking more seriously about that?
00:13:24.514 - 00:14:08.738, Speaker B: I think it's just priorities right now. I think there's only so much the teams can work on and I think that they're really trying to work on getting more wrapped assets back, like the wrapped bitcoin that just came out. And I think they're really trying to just build overall liquidity. I just don't think that there's really been a firm consensus and a will to push that to the top of the list right now. I think that also Solana likes showing that they're the fastest, easiest chain to use. And so maybe there's this idea that we don't want to artificially do anything that makes it slower or less user friendly. This really feels like the chain to go for a user friendly experience.
00:14:08.738 - 00:14:52.224, Speaker B: And so maybe people don't want to go in and slow things down or make things more locked than they need to be. When Solana's calling card right now is this ability of how easy and cheap and fast it is. I will point out that when FTX crashed, we did see a small of the market liquidity of liquid staking tokens. But because the epochs were so short, it didn't last very long at all. It was only about a day and a brief defect of like, I want to say marinade fared the best because it was the highest volume and most liquidity and I think we went down to like 0.91 to one. But if they extended the epochs, things like that, maybe that's worse.
00:14:52.224 - 00:15:11.104, Speaker B: It does seem like the epochs, people seem to like them now and the liquidity continues to improve. But I think if let's get more activity back on the chain. First, let's get more tokens launched, I think. And then maybe you look to implement some of these other kind of governance type items.
00:15:18.504 - 00:15:49.874, Speaker A: Can you actually talk a bit more about the government side of marinade specifically, kind of the motivation behind the token itself? I know it came a bit after the release, which generally I'm in support of, because it means you have a product that people use, and then the token is just sort of there as a kind of a bonus to enhance the protocol. So I applaud that. But maybe, I guess I don't really understand fully the governance side of marinade and what role the token plays and all that. And if it theoretically accrues value somehow. Can you walk us a bit through that side?
00:15:50.334 - 00:16:26.508, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to. Mnde is our governance token, and as you mentioned, we launched it November 2021, maybe October, November 2021. So the protocol was live as of August, and then the token launched a couple months later. And then we launched on chain governance in April of 2022. So we were like officially an on Chain DaO. And really the first kind of things we implemented was this idea of like voting for validators. So I can take my mnde, I can lock it, and I can decide to like vote for a validator to get more soul stake.
00:16:26.508 - 00:17:10.580, Speaker B: And so for a validator, their bottom line is improved, you know, instantly and at times dramatically, by voting for them. So you've seen maybe some validators get their own MNDe, or they lobby MnDe holders or the community to get them to vote for them. So that's really the kind of fundamental thing. And it's changed a little since we moved to Rome's governance. We did a migration earlier this year, but the core point is the same in that 20% of the stake pool gets determined by MnDe votes. And so when you think of a stake pool that's got about 7.5 million sold right now between our native and liquid staking soul, that's like 1.51.6
00:17:10.580 - 00:17:39.134, Speaker B: or so million Sol that MDE is directing. And so there's that element that's kind of the simplest kind of bottom line thing to explain. But then we also have direct control of the treasury now on realms governance as a result of the locked MDE token. So that's another big thing that as the DAO gets more and more decentralized, the MNDE token holders can basically vote on really all things regarding the protocol and the treasury.
00:17:39.874 - 00:18:03.654, Speaker C: It reminds me a little bit of curves, tokenomics, and how convex then built on top of them to then create this bribing layer almost so that you could incentivize people to issue curved tokens to your trading pairs. But here it could be marinade staked, sold to the validators. So could you envisage something like that being built on top of it at some point?
00:18:04.324 - 00:18:43.808, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, we're seeing the early parts of that. So in addition to 20% of the pool being used or being directed by MNDE, another 20% can be directed using the MSOL stake. So if I stake sol and get emsil, I can vote for a validator. And this is only a couple months old, but we already are seeing some validators being pretty aggressive with attracting stake. Solana Compass comes to mind. So they're airdropping stakers rewards if they direct stake to their node from marinade. So each epoch you'll get like a little boost of rewards.
00:18:43.808 - 00:19:40.704, Speaker B: And I'm already kind of hearing some other kind of unsung, kind of under undercover stuff happening too where validators are building things. I would like to see like more of like a centralized, maybe not centralized, but more of like a, a place anyone can go, like a bribe market. I think that'd be pretty cool to have. I don't know if marinate should build that, or if someone just from the community should build it on our behalf. Kind of open to both ways, but I know that now that we're on realms, I think the hope would be to see more of that for sure between the M soul voting and the MNDE voting, because the M soul voting has an interesting dynamic to it in that the ratio can really change depending on how many people are voting for a specific validator versus just going to the general pool. So right now, if I direct one soul to a validator using diem sole voting, they're going to get 2.5 soul to their node.
00:19:40.704 - 00:20:16.664, Speaker B: And so that's a really kind of attractive thing for validators to think about, is that I could ask you to stick with me directly and just get one sole for me and your staking rewards are locked. Or you can stay liquid and direct 2.5 sold to me. So a lot of validators are seeing this, and the ratio is getting better and better too, since the native staking that maybe I can mention, but it's introduced probably the most mature gaming governance element of staking so far in Solana. I think we want to continue that.
00:20:17.974 - 00:21:10.864, Speaker A: I think it'd actually be helpful to unpack a bit the dynamic between all the stakeholders. I say that in air quotes. I don't mean, like, literally, like sole stake, but just the different components of marinade versus doing it the vanilla way. Where the vanilla way is, I just stake directly with a validator 100% and it's locked, and I just get a yield. And they might get some commission, maybe they don't, just depending on how they set it up. And then in this pooled approach, you have a bunch of validators interfacing with, meridate theoretically, and then the protocol. This is kind of where I'm not sure exactly how it works, but the protocol, based on some of these voting mechanics you describe, determines how the Solana that comes into marinade gets distributed amongst all of these validators, who then actually do the hard work of validating, and the end user, in exchange gets this derivative token.
00:21:10.864 - 00:21:25.290, Speaker A: Msoul, but could you walk us a bit, maybe correct any of the assumptions I made and also walk us through the business model, who's paying the fee for this more convenient and liquid approach? And how does that differ from doing it the vanilla way?
00:21:25.482 - 00:22:02.886, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. Thanks for coming back to this, too, because I know my first answer, I did not address the whole delegation element of it. The delegation element of it is really kind of the secret sauce, I think, at marinade. So when I vanilla stake with one validator, I'm delegating all my stake to one validator, and it's really like, their performance is like, you know, everything for my staking rewards. So if they are kicking butt, if they're the top validator on the network, I'm getting like, maybe eight plus percent apy on them. If they go offline, I get nothing.
00:22:02.886 - 00:22:41.018, Speaker B: You know, I'm earning no rewards or some, this doesn't happen too often, but it's, like, happened like a few hundred times in that validators will change their commission and not tell you. So, like, I stick with you. You say you have a 5% commission, and then they sneakily change it to 100% commission. Don't tell me about it, and I have to find out about that. So those are some of the reasons why you wouldn't do that. You might also remember the Hetzner outage that happened in November where 20% of stakeholders got knocked offline. And so these are all reasons why you want to basically spread your stake out to multiple validators.
00:22:41.018 - 00:23:32.514, Speaker B: And that's really the fundamental kind of value proposition of marinade from when it came out, is this idea that we find 100 plus of the best validators on a network, and we spread your stake out around them. So if one of them goes offline, you're impacted almost like not at all. We're also rebalancing it every epoch. So if we detect a validator is starting to have more offline time or other performance problems, we'll boot them and bring someone else in. So it's just auto rebalancing. It's like having a great managed index fund, and it's all really happening kind of algorithmically and automatically. So that controls 60% of the stake pool, and then you have the 20% m and e votes and then the 20% MSL votes.
00:23:32.514 - 00:24:16.314, Speaker B: So that's the breakdown. And I mentioned Marinade native. This is kind of one of those only possible on Solana moments that we just launched this summer, is that the fees that you mentioned. So Marinade has a 6% performance fee on the rewards. So that is distributed to the protocol for the liquid staking. And just like the management of it, however, we launched native staking this year, and it's the same delegation strategy as liquid staking. And what we're able to do is basically instead of depositing into a smart contract, you're just giving your stake authority to marinade, and we're creating, like, 100 stake accounts, like, instantly for you and spreading the stake out that way.
00:24:16.314 - 00:25:03.920, Speaker B: And so what we've noticed is that a lot of people, they want the delegation strategy of marinade, but they weren't ready for Defi and they didn't want to deal with smart contracts yet. They kind of want to let Solana mature more. So we built the native stake for them to kind of get their foot in the door with marinade, understand all the tools we have for them, and then when they're ready, they can move it over to msoul whenever they want. So what we really, like, we've kind of pivoted from, like, liquid staking to, like, automated staking. Like, you can either liquid or native stake automatically with us, and it's just like, kind of more peace of mind. Like, if the average person shouldn't stake with one validator, because they're not going to want to check in on their performance every, every week or two. Right.
00:25:03.920 - 00:25:13.364, Speaker B: And, like, when you think about, like, how you pick a validator, I don't know how you guys first picked a validator, but, like, you just go to Phantom and there's all these, like, weird names. Just scroll through emojis.
00:25:13.744 - 00:25:15.728, Speaker A: Yeah, you pick, pick the coolest looking one.
00:25:15.856 - 00:25:41.744, Speaker B: Yeah. So, like, that's not, I don't know, that's probably not ideal. And we're trying to get Marinade into Phantom two for native staking. But it makes sense, like, you don't want to have all your eggs in one basket for really any investment. And so with marinade, we're kind of just, we're handling it for you. You're going to get a competitive APY. And if any validators, rug or anything like that, like, we'll take care of it for you.
00:25:41.744 - 00:25:42.648, Speaker B: Right. Right.
00:25:42.776 - 00:26:44.544, Speaker A: So here's the thing. Something that I've wondered a lot about is it seems like the whole point of blockchain is that anyone can run a validator, anyone can attract stake if they're good enough at being a validator. And that's kind of over time how you distribute the compute layer of the protocol for Solana itself and make it redundant and robust. The question I have is if we start using protocols like marinade, and I know this is a criticism that Lido has brought forth to eth for long time now, and now the protocol is effectively this middleman that's deciding which validators ultimately get almost all the stake. Does that not create new kind of centralization vectors or is that a cause for concern? Because you mentioned, you guys seem to be pretty particular about which validator is good enough to sort of onboard into marinade. Tell us a bit about that vetting process. And does it, how do you guys sort of guard against like the inherent centralization vector that that might bring?
00:26:44.884 - 00:27:36.714, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. You know, it's, it's one of those things where, you know, Lido being so far ahead of, you know, anyone on Solana, on Ethereum, they're, they're kind of taking that, the incoming, the hardest. It's, it's hard for marinade to like, feel like a real huge decentralization risk when we're like 2% of the stake right now and we're like delegating all of it. Like, we don't have, we don't have a validator ourselves. So, like, I think if Marinade was a validator, we might be like the, in the top ten validators of all our stake. And that's going to like 100 plus. So it does feel premature to talk about centralization, but it's always good to talk about just because, you know, Marinades ethos as a community funded grant project is like our whole goal is to be as decentralized as possible with the stake pool and also the governance token.
00:27:36.714 - 00:28:29.158, Speaker B: So I think number one, like, the community votes, that's, you know, there are stop guards in place for centralization. There especially with the M and D portion, because there's a cap on the amount of votes any validator can get on the MND portion. And so like right there, you've kind of taken out that risk. We decided on 100 validators to stake to right now, and it's basically decided on a combination of decentralization and performance. And so we don't want to stake to the same servers and locations. So number one, that's part of the strategy is we want to make sure that all the validators are spread out, both from a hardware and location perspective. But then really what we want to do is make sure that the validators are sustainable too.
00:28:29.158 - 00:29:27.194, Speaker B: So it used to be 400 validators, but we found that like the longest tail of that 400 weren't really getting enough meaningful stakes, so we shrank it to 100 because we want to make sure that, like the stake means something in the current dynamics of the token price and such. But I think the governance token being pretty widely distributed already, we've seen some nice analysis of this and that it's not really like this whale token whatsoever. It's pretty nicely and widely distributed and that's going to continue with the initiatives that we have. So, like the token will be, you know, I think as far as daos are concerned, yeah, we're still early and like, we can all decentralize our tokens more, but we're on the path, I think, also having pretty much everything that we do. Open source is huge too. You know, being multisig, all these things. I think those are all things that I think, you know, guard against centralization.
00:29:27.194 - 00:29:36.870, Speaker B: But again, I feel like it's a premature thing. Like, I mean, how much sold we need to hit Lido's level. Like, Lido is at like 33% of each stake or something.
00:29:36.942 - 00:29:38.830, Speaker A: I mean it's like on the, on the cusp.
00:29:38.942 - 00:29:40.914, Speaker B: Yeah. So we need like a ten x.
00:29:42.134 - 00:30:22.734, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely bullish scenario. But just given that you guys are the market leader in liquid stake in Solana, and if that sort of, we see that shift from, from native to liquid happen, conceivably we might see a future where it could ratchet up. But I agree, it's not a concern. Now, it does feel like to the earlier points we've made, it's just so logical for an end user to use a liquid staking protocol. They're doing it the right way, even if they're using this new product you're talking about, where they're not even using the LST, but just spreading out their stake natively. Across a lot of values, it's safer for them, a less downside risk. And so yeah, I see a future where people use these types of protocols.
00:30:22.734 - 00:30:46.484, Speaker A: But it does come to question, like if we start centralizing the delegation side of things, does that create new problems? And one could argue that phantom kind of already is a vector in of itself. Like you have to be on that list basically to capture any retail users delegation, because they're probably not going to go out of their way to spin up a terminal and do it that way. But yeah, that's a good point you're making.
00:30:51.344 - 00:31:25.484, Speaker C: Can you lean more into the algorithmic side of things and try and automate it as much as possible? Because correct me if I'm wrong, once people are on the list, then MND holders can allocate stake to the people on the list. But I feel like the centralization risk, if you like, is just how you get people onto that list. You mentioned earlier that there's some algorithmic aspect to it, but can you just try and like automate that maybe as much possible, like we need, you know, this geographic area is not being covered as much as we'd like, you know, things like that, and just try and look at it that way.
00:31:25.864 - 00:32:10.594, Speaker B: Yeah. I'll also mention too that you can vote for validators who are in the top 100. So the algorithm is covering the top 100 by score that marinade does. And if I see a validator out there that isn't in the top 100, I can vote for them and they'll be added. So at any given time, we'll have like maybe 100, 2130 validators who are, are getting stake because some of them are not in that algorithmic stake, but people are voting for them, just as they do have to meet like a certain performance minimum to be included. Like if they're just like a 0%, like offline validator, they're not gonna get any stake even if I vote for them. But yeah, I think, you know, the 60% algorithm, the 20% of each is like governable metrics.
00:32:10.594 - 00:33:02.174, Speaker B: So like it used to be 10% mnde and like Noah, no MSL. So like for a time, like when it first launched, it was 90% algorithm. So then now we're at 60% algorithm. And I think that the token and making sure that the right people who like, understand like what marinade does and they're voting on these parameters, I think that'll, that'll be good. Like, one other thing that we've done like a lot this year is making sure that all of our scoring strategy and like our epoch reports are all like visible and like downloadable and easy to look at. So, you know, this year, if you ask validators, it's like a lot easier for them to understand, like why marinade is sending steak where they are. Like last year might have taken a little bit more kind of research and kind of having to unpack things to see what was really going on there.
00:33:02.174 - 00:33:22.734, Speaker B: But I think as we just make everything more and more transparent and easier to vote, get the token as widely distributed as possible, make sure validators are getting the token. We want validators to have md, we want them to have a seat at the table and help us decide what's good for the network. I think those are all things that will help us in the long run.
00:33:22.894 - 00:34:08.966, Speaker C: I think another interesting thing that's come out from the ETH side is they're saying now there's so much stake in Lido that the LDO token has so much say really over Ethereum itself. And now they're starting to look maybe at having ETH holders as like the final backstop, that they have a veto rights. So maybe that's something else we can look at in the future. But so I feel like we've looked now at how you're trying to encourage people to stake with marinade, but maybe we could also look at how you're thinking about once those lsts are in existence, how we can actually start utilizing them in applications. Because of course, to increase the TVL on Solana, it's not enough just to be an LST. It then has to be used in another application to sort of count as TVL. So just.
00:34:08.966 - 00:34:10.834, Speaker C: Yeah, how are you thinking about that?
00:34:11.374 - 00:35:10.655, Speaker B: Yeah, I think obviously the bouncing back from last fall during FTX, I mean, for a time there was really like little to no lend borrow happening on Solana, like with the lsts. So basically it practically had to like start from scratch, just because all the health on all these, all these protocols really suffered. So really 2023 has been all about just building back up the health of these collateral protocols, because that really is kind of the first spot for most people to take their liquid staking token is to borrow against it, usually, unless they're going to supply liquidity and things like that. But getting the borrow going is great. We still want to see more adoption in wallets so that it's like an easy option to get liquid staking tokens when you stake, and not just stake to a validator. A lot of the wallets have their own validator and so they like to kind of promote those validators. So we're kind of lobbing for them to maybe try something else.
00:35:10.655 - 00:36:08.376, Speaker B: Coinbase wallet does something really cool on Ethereum, is they have like, you can stick with coinbase on Ethereum, or you can do like the decentralized, like, racquetball option. And so that's something we've been trying to kind of reach out to wallets about and see if they would do something similar. Just being able to spread the stake around, I think that would be great. NFTs, we're not in the most bullish part of the cycle for NFTs right now. There was a lot more interest in them last year. But I think getting msoul, really any liquid staking token into as many marketplaces as possible is just huge. And it's huge for the marketplaces too, because, you know, if magic Eden or tensor or any of these marketplaces receive your soul, you know, from a purchase, and it's just like sitting in an account somewhere, like it's not earning yield and it's getting diluted just like your soul and your wallet is too.
00:36:08.376 - 00:36:51.024, Speaker B: And so we've been trying to pitch this idea of like, you know, the amms on like tensor, for example. Like, it shouldn't be like a sole JPEG, it should be like an Msoul JPEG pool and really just trying to get everything as like capital efficient as possible. So there's that too, I think just getting as much marketplace adoption as possible. And also, you know, we are seeing like the advanced trading strategies, like, like mango drift, that they are adding liquid staking tokens. Amsoil is on pith. It's good for trading, and the volume is pretty high. And we're seeing that the volumes improve on LSD's across the board there too.
00:36:51.024 - 00:37:48.424, Speaker B: So that's good to see, too. You could also go into this idea of these algorithmically backed stable coins with liquid staking tokens that I've heard a little bit about. I'm less knowledgeable about what's happening on Solana with that right now, but I think we will kind of start seeing more use cases in adoption. I think especially in the bear market for NFT marketplaces, they're kind of looking for ways to re trigger some enthusiasm. And so I've had some talks with them and they seem interested. So, yeah, I'm bullish on what's possible because I think we haven't really gone deep enough yet because especially like, if you look at the lending rates for liquid staking tokens, they're basically zero if you're not getting liquidity mining rewards on top of it. So making them desirable assets to borrow too would be cool.
00:37:48.424 - 00:38:52.204, Speaker B: And then also, one other cool thing that we've seen this year is this idea of the super stake soul and leverage staking that just came out this summer. Super stake stole was built by the drift team so you can leverage your liquid staking token like two to three x using their Lendborrow platform. And Solend came out with one too shortly after. And Soland was always kind of this OG lending protocol where people would do it manually, they would supply msoul borrow Sol mint, msoul just kind of do this loop on their own, and maybe you can kind of get lost with everything that's going on there. But the new uis, the super stake Sol UI is very nice, and you can kind of leverage up your liquid soul stake to pretty nice yields that are higher than native staking and all that. So that's bullish. I think builders, like I mentioned at the beginning, builders are constantly reaching out to us, asking us, like, about stuff and how to collab.
00:38:52.204 - 00:38:57.444, Speaker B: It seems like just this year people have been kind of waking up more and more to LSD's.
00:38:59.144 - 00:39:59.974, Speaker A: I agree that people are definitely something about the end of last year into this year, a lot more interest in lsts. Also from the competitive landscape side, Jitto has a token now, Jito Soul and Lido seems to be, I mean, they've been around on Solana for a while, but it seems to me like a three man race, basically, with marinade up ahead and Solana in terms of liquid staking and then Lido, followed by Judo Soul, which is up, I think, 40% in TvO in the last month. So definitely heating up with the kind of mev powered staking rewards. How do you guys think about the competitive landscape? I mean, from a consumer standpoint, it seems to me like a pretty, like a fungible product in the sense that I'm just taking Solana and I'm getting sort of a liquid token in return that I could do stuff with. And to me, it seems like the key differentiator would be liquidity on other Defi protocols that support the token. Is there anything else I'm missing? How do you guys think about differentiating from the competition?
00:40:00.314 - 00:40:14.764, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. Well, number one, just to kind of bring up the lido thing, there's a proposal on the Lido forum right now that's pondering whether to continue, like operating and building on Solana.
00:40:14.884 - 00:40:16.224, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that.
00:40:18.124 - 00:41:00.616, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's a tough thing, because, like, I think Solana got more interest in liquid staking this year because of liquid staking and staking on eth happening. And, you know, I think I still do want, like, Lido to be involved in building and bringing eyeballs, especially if we're going to be trying to attract liquidity from Ethereum. Yeah, you know, maybe we need that familiar name. And so it's. It's a little troubling for me to see them maybe just considering giving up. But I understand the business reason why when you, when you think about what their TVL is here versus Ethereum, which is just, I don't know how many multiples, but it's a lot. So.
00:41:00.616 - 00:41:50.316, Speaker B: Yeah, but, yeah, props to Jito. And, you know, they're focused on Solana 100%, so it's always kind of cool to see the teams that are so committed to Solana. Soul blaze has been building like crazy, doing air drops and stuff like that, really trying to build. They're maybe a little similar to marinade in that kind of a community run protocol that's really trying to do it without a whole lot of support. And so that, and for soul play, it's probably even less than what Marinate's gotten over the years. So it's great to see that they're really building a lot of governance elements. So, yeah, it really seems like to me, with Lido kind of uncertain of its future, that it's like marinade, Jito, Soul Blaze, and then I think that those are.
00:41:50.316 - 00:42:51.614, Speaker B: That's kind of the trio right now. And I would say that the differences from a competitive landscape is, I think we're using our governance token to our advantage, and the fact that we've been out long enough, and this idea of directed stake and this kind of gamification of being able to. For validators to get more soul stake via marinade, the fact that the native stake can improve the amount of overall stake they get for marinade is huge, too. So that's big. And then, of course, integrations and liquidity are big. Marinades typically had the most volume of all the liquid staking tokens, but I think I'm seeing that it's been a little more level recently, just given all the points and airdrop stuff. I think Marinade just has the Lindy advantage of being out over two years, being open source, being community funded, and the directed stake elements, and just this idea of a governance token that is really widely distributed nicely to date.
00:42:51.614 - 00:43:34.666, Speaker B: There's no real big, like whales. And I'll also mention, like, the MEV thing, I think there's a misconception there in that any stake pool can stake with a validator who collects meV. So I think, Marinade, we've got about 60 or 70 geovalidators in the stake pool right now. So, like, we, we collect mev, Sol blaze can. The delegation strategy is another element there where I think, you know, Marinade, we can stake to judo validators as much as we want, and then choose to decentralize, too, so we can kind of get the best of both worlds from an MEV perspective. But also, Mev, like, Solana is, like, not Ethereum Mev. It's, you know, if there's potential there.
00:43:34.666 - 00:44:03.014, Speaker B: I mean, if we can get, like, ten more visas on Solana and get some crazy mints, and suddenly I think Mev gets pretty wild. I won't speak too much of the technical part of Mev. I'm not the tech guru there, but yeah, but yeah, I mean, Mev is available for really any stake pool to get. So I think we're all excited to see more chain activity and hopefully some Mev come out of that for stakers.
00:44:04.074 - 00:44:49.824, Speaker A: Let's actually talk about the. You brought up the proposal, and that was actually going to be my next question, because I've only seen a tweet about it, and maybe I'll just kind of paraphrase what they wrote, but I think there's some criticism that Solana Foundation's conservative with, I guess, delegation, and they made a comparison to Polygon foundation, which seems to be more actively incentivizing projects to allocate more by allocating more tokens. I mean, what's your read on the situation? This is just a tweet I saw maybe a week or two ago. To your point, it does seem like they're questioning whether it's worth being on Solana from a business standpoint to make the economics work. But what's your take on the situation?
00:44:50.964 - 00:45:31.686, Speaker B: Yeah, Solana does have a stake delegation program that I'm sure a lot of people who have been on Solana while are familiar with. But it was basically a way early on to bootstrap the validator network and make validators sufficient enough to be able to operate. So the foundation has about 70 to 80 million sol earmarked for this purpose. To date, they have not staked any of that for liquid staking. So they're, they're kind of one by one doing it. And I think if I speak for them, maybe they don't necessarily like how cumbersome it is to, like, manually handle, like, one by one delegation, all these validators. It sounds like there's a.
00:45:31.686 - 00:46:08.430, Speaker B: I've always seen validators complaining about the waiting list. There's. So I think there is an interest from the Solana foundation. They've indicated this in some replies to some of these tweets, that there is an interest of moving some of this into liquid staking. And so I think that's something that we could see this fall. My question, though, would be, is that will they also put it in defi? Because I think the Defi teams could really use it, too, especially whale liquidity. I was just talking with Ben Chow from Meteor and Jupiter earlier today, and, like, the liquidity for whales on Solana is still not good enough yet.
00:46:08.430 - 00:46:54.194, Speaker B: So, you know, if, if I'm an 8th whale, I hear how amazing drift or mango is, and I want to move my stack over there, and then I, you know, 5% slippage on the trade. Right. That's, that's not good. So I do, though, like, I think, yeah, I think maybe we're all biased here, kind of being, you know, mostly on Solana, but I think the foundation is sensitive to this fact that they don't want to be kind of seen as like, supplying astroturf. I think they really want to see as much get built out organically as possible. And then if they, if they feel like they're the blocker, then they'll try and unblock it. And in the case of liquid staking, I mean, they have a ton of, of soul.
00:46:54.194 - 00:47:29.114, Speaker B: I mean, that's what's 70% of, like 500,000,500 or something. That's a lot. So I think it makes sense for them, and they've indicated this, to maybe put some of that into liquid staking tokens soon. And I'm sure the Defi teams are all eager to prove that they can handle that stake, too. I think obviously, it's in the foundation's best interest, though, to be very careful with those tokens and make sure that where they're putting them, they're being put in secure places. And if so, then I think Solana is a lot stronger, but they should be careful.
00:47:35.814 - 00:47:54.496, Speaker C: Do you think there's a risk also coming from maybe some of the centralized entities to just come in and dominate this staking token marketplace? So Coinbase, binance, one of those guys just offering a really easy service and then suddenly just dominating the market? Is that a possibility? Is that a risk you think about?
00:47:54.640 - 00:48:29.584, Speaker B: Well, first of all, shout out to Coinbase. Like, they reached out to us to listens and they listed us last year and they were super awesome working with them. And so they put Msoul and Mnde on there. But they also do have their own validator. It's a very large validator, so they could very much create their own liquid token if they want. I'm kind of bullish Coinbase and believe that they're doing generally good things for crypto overall right now. Let's say they turned their Coinbase validator into a liquid option.
00:48:29.584 - 00:49:05.804, Speaker B: It would introduce more fragmented liquid staking liquidity. In the short term, I think all competition is good. I mean, you guys mentioned the lido centralization problem. Like, how amazing would it be if, like, Marinade had, like, 30 or 40 million stake and like, five others did too? Like, I don't think anyone at Marinade would, like, be mad if, like, liquid staking had proliferated to a point where there were numerous players, all offering a different spin on liquid staking, all thriving, because I think we would all be in a very nice place if that happened.
00:49:06.564 - 00:49:51.250, Speaker A: You're obviously talking to a lot of Defi teams, whether they want to collaborate or just in these circles. What is your sense of. Because you mentioned this point about whale liquidity and making it whale friendly, they want to be able to do things in size, and it seems like it's hard to do that on Solana because Solana Defi has this liquidity problem. Generally, from what you're hearing and learning from other teams or whatever you're talking about, talking about internally, marinade, how does Solana actually bridge that gap? And I think now is an interesting time. We also brought a coinbase. Well, base has more TVL than Solana by a good margin, and they've been around for like, two months. And we could argue about, oh, it's an l two.
00:49:51.250 - 00:50:10.114, Speaker A: It's easy to bridge liquidity over, but at the end of the day, it does feel like Solana Defi is getting lapped in a few ways. What do we think is the future for Solana Defi ecosystem to thrive? How do we attract liquidity and capital? What's your take on that?
00:50:13.214 - 00:50:47.664, Speaker B: I had an answer to this. I don't know. I might be doing a lot better than I am. But yeah, I think about 2022 and end of 2021 and how many hacks there were. I think that DeFi protocols just need to be, like, battle tested like crazy for whales to really feel good. And I think they're on the right path. But I think about all the things that happened around FTX, around some of the risk parameters on certain protocols.
00:50:47.664 - 00:51:38.776, Speaker B: I think Solana moved kind of quickly in 2021 to attract, you know, to kind of hit. Hit the bull run at the right time. And maybe there were some protocols that maybe went to market too quickly or maybe kind of did some vanity things. So I think. And, you know, the wormhole thing was brutal, too, even though that's not really Solana, but it was, like, Solana related. So I just think about, like, Lindy and trust, and I think the Solana teams, we all need to, like, hold each other's feet to the fire with regards to doing everything security wise the right way. I think after the FTX hack, there was an analysis that only maybe five or six out of the top ten protocols on Solana were on multisigs.
00:51:38.776 - 00:51:43.352, Speaker B: I think that was around the time that people didn't know who had the serum keys.
00:51:43.528 - 00:51:46.140, Speaker A: Oh, no. Oh, yeah, I remember that. Yeah.
00:51:46.292 - 00:52:37.238, Speaker B: So not good, obviously. So, you know, I think we just have to be, like, rock solid, like, competing against, like, Aave or these, like, Ogs. We have to be as trusted for everything as they are, and it's going to take time. But also, you know, whales need to, like, see opportunity over here, and it's kind of a chicken and the egg situation where, you know, maybe I'm a whale with 10 million to deploy over here, but why, like, what's the risk? And why is it worth it? So there's really just going to have to be opportunities. And I keep hearing about, like, more tokens coming out this fall and Solana, maybe. Maybe that does it. Maybe, you know, maybe there's more partnerships coming down the line with regards to, you know, things like visa or whatnot.
00:52:37.238 - 00:52:57.174, Speaker B: It's kind of hard to. Hard to see, like, where the whales come in, but just the more trust in the chain and the trust and the applications on top of it, hopefully get things going in the right direction. Maybe you've got to see some of it if you're the foundation to start and just kind of prove that you can do it and maybe people follow that line.
00:52:58.154 - 00:54:04.574, Speaker C: I'd love to get your take on sort of the future of lsts, because to my left of the bell curve brain, if you hold Sol, you are getting deflated away, and there's going to be 1.5% inflation ad infinitum from about 2031. So you're always going to be inflated away if you just hold Sol, whereas if you just hold the LST, then not only are you not getting inflated away, but you should also be earning a yield from the fees and from Mev as well. So it just seems to me like if inevitably the endgame of this, once the institutions are here, and hopefully these are huge assets, the big l one tokens, surely it has to inevitably move over to the point where LST becomes like the de facto asset of the protocol. Because why wouldn't you? Why would you be holding the base asset? So just wondering, is that the way you see it going, where it's going to be? Almost 100% of stake is probably held in LST purely because you can then re hypothecate it and use it in other DeFi applications. Or do you see the future going a bit differently?
00:54:07.394 - 00:55:24.072, Speaker B: I think maybe some people who have DeFi protocols with risk management might look at this answer differently than us. I think it'd be easy for us to say, yeah, everything should be an LST, everything should be liquid. But then you kind of hear various things from defi protocol suggesting that if we have, you know, some whale with all this, lst could like nuke the protocol if they get liquidated or things like that. So, like, I think it would have to be in concert with all the DeFi protocols having really, really strong risk engines and not taking more stake or lsts than they can handle. Because, you know, I think when you like, stack like composable elements, there's a lot more reward and opportunity. But if you like, if anything goes wrong in the stack, you could have like a cataclysmic event on a DeFi protocol, if something deeps or things like that, if the risk isn't right. So I don't know if like 80, 90% LST is necessarily feasible anytime soon until really everywhere it goes is really managed very responsibly, I suppose, is the.
00:55:24.088 - 00:55:58.384, Speaker C: Other point of that. Generally, these liquid staking protocols have a tendency to centralize around, I mean, on etH, it's really, it's one asset, obviously, with a couple of also rans, because once you become a certain size, then suddenly you're integrated with all of the Defi applications. You're the most liquid one, you've got the strongest peg, things like that. So it does feel like these things potentially will reduce down to maybe one major option. So do you think that's also potentially part of this endgame of lsts on these layer one protocols?
00:55:58.804 - 00:56:55.030, Speaker B: Maybe, but Jupiter's got that interconnected liquidity now. So marinate had very good liquidity compared to all the liquid staking tokens until a few months ago. Now the interconnected liquidity has really elevated the liquidity for all of them. Now, I would let a technical person explain exactly why that is, but really the liquidity for all of them are quite solid and probably better than they've ever been. So I think about it from a user's perspective though. And I think one of the things that bothers me the most about the LST dynamic is that they're all different prices. So like MSoul is a higher price than Lido and Jito simply because it's been on the market longer, because the price of MSOL goes up over time compared to SoL.
00:56:55.030 - 00:57:25.374, Speaker B: So like every two to three days, it just like inches up a little bit in price based on the underlying staking rewards. And so every, everything costs. The price of all these liquid staking tokens are a little different. I think people don't understand why that is. And then I think about a builder at Magic Eden trying to explain to somebody to pay an LST, and then how come the price is this and how come the price is that? That can be really confusing. And so I think eventually it just needs to be kind of extracted away almost completely. Like we're paying for everything in soul, but like underlying is rlst.
00:57:25.374 - 00:58:01.304, Speaker B: I think that might be the most elegant solution to like not confuse people. Because, you know, as the comms guy at marinade, I'm like constantly explaining to people like how this works. People kind of struggle with this, this whole idea of like a rewards bearing token that goes up in price for soul. They think they're going to get more soul, like regular staking. So it's constant re education, and I'm not convinced that onboard's like a billion people. So I think it needs to like, like everything that the gas needs to be like extracted away. Users shouldn't see gas.
00:58:01.304 - 00:58:17.812, Speaker B: Maybe users shouldn't see the liquid staking token. They just know that it's their earning for them on these applications, like marketplaces. Maybe in defi it's different, but the consumer apps, it should just be like this engine underneath, right?
00:58:17.868 - 00:58:37.554, Speaker A: Yeah. And they should be fungible with one another across protocols, not have different prices. I don't want to go buy my NFT with four different LSD quotes plus native Solana. So that makes sense too. Well, tell us about what you guys are focused on. Like the roadmap for marinade. What's next for you guys?
00:58:38.974 - 00:59:00.706, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. It's already been a pretty gigantic year for us. Launched a bunch. I mean direct at stake and native were two kind of big game changers for us that we saw a lot of momentum. And so we're just continuing to build those things out. And actually starting October 1, our new incentives campaign kicks in.
00:59:00.706 - 00:59:28.450, Speaker B: So we had done away with liquidity mining. We felt like it wasn't working. And so this is our new incentives program. So anybody holding MSOL or marinade native is going to be earning m and E on top of that. So this is kind of like a 2.0 type of incentive in that, you know, we pay it out at the end of the period in January and it comes in a lock token. So we're kind of like slowing down the whole like liquidity mining element of it.
00:59:28.450 - 01:00:13.058, Speaker B: But we know that we do want to get more tokens out there to the people and to MSL holders. We really kind of view that MNDE should only be distributed for contribution to the protocol or for TVL. And so this is kind of that in spirit too. And then the referral program too is also big too. So anyone can use the referral program to get native stake or to attract native stake. And you both earn MnDe by referring stakers for marinate native as a way to kind of get that out there. Because we think that the near term goal for marinate native is probably higher than MSL just given that like 97 98% of stake is native.
01:00:13.058 - 01:00:53.780, Speaker B: And we think that it's like a great stepping stone into marinade, into liquid staking by starting with native, if you're not too sure. So other than that, I think we're working on contract upgrades, working with the validators on some bonding things and some technical things that we're looking forward to sharing. But really from a consumer focused standpoint, really getting directed stake out there and marinative has been really huge. And now we're celebrating the, the q four with the incentives. So anyone with Msoul, you don't have to do anything. You'll get your MDE as incentives starting in January. So start stacking.
01:00:53.780 - 01:01:04.544, Speaker B: If you're interested in joining the protocol, that's my shill. I'm not a master shiller, I'm the conservative guy. But there's me trying the shill.
01:01:07.324 - 01:01:17.874, Speaker A: It's kind of brilliant actually just embracing how people stake in Solana, everyone's doing it natively, so why not just make it easier and better experience for people and reward them for it too? That's super exciting.
01:01:18.034 - 01:01:52.074, Speaker B: Yeah. It's really one of the real only ways that you can earn on top of native staking right now. So the APY combined should be favorable compared to really any single validator. And we've seen validators are on board, too, with native, too, because the bigger native gets and the bigger marinade gets, really, the healthier the network gets. That's really the main, the main goal behind marinade is like, as we grow, Solana grows, and then we kind of all grow together and the network is kicking butt, decentralized and all that.
01:01:52.614 - 01:01:55.398, Speaker C: Same thoughts with our podcast as well. Grow alongside salon.
01:01:55.446 - 01:02:08.228, Speaker B: Yeah. Great work. Yeah, I mean, it's good to build it now and then eventually people come back to crypto. Maybe we'll see when, but perhaps I have faith they're coming. If you build it, they will come, right?
01:02:08.356 - 01:02:34.704, Speaker A: Yeah, that's how it works. Well, kind of. To close this out, would love to just hear what you're excited about in crypto. It doesn't have to be LST or marinade related, but I'm sure you're deep into a lot of stuff these days. What's kind of on your radar as we skate through this? It feels like 2019, personally, the last bear market, but there's always stuff on the horizon that kind of keep us going.
01:02:36.004 - 01:03:20.154, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I really think that we're on the cusp of, like, actually starting to see some, like, really nice, you know, applications for, for users that can really onboard people. Like, I feel like it's been infrastructure week for like two years on Twitter, we're just, like, talking about infrastructure and arguing about infrastructure. Oh, yeah. But, but you do think about the last bull in 2021. There were a lot of teams raising, and I think the infrastructure is in a place now where I think we are going to start seeing some really interesting consumer adoption applications. So real world assets can be one thing, but also just much cooler ways to use nfts.
01:03:20.154 - 01:03:58.270, Speaker B: Ponzonomics kind of stripped down a little bit and maybe being a little better. I think we've learned a lot. I think everyone has. And I think we're going to see a lot of fresh eyes coming in very soon and really integrating certain web3 principles in a lot of different ways in consumer applications. I think some of these applications, we might not even like, they might not even say NFT, but there's NFT in there, or they're using stable coins and you don't even know it. Things like that I'm excited about. I'm so excited for it, actually, that I pitched a newsletter to the Solana collective.
01:03:58.270 - 01:03:59.794, Speaker B: Do you guys know the Solana collective?
01:04:00.934 - 01:04:02.110, Speaker A: Actually not familiar. No.
01:04:02.182 - 01:04:34.634, Speaker B: Okay. So it's an arm of the foundation where it's like a community arm. And they've been doing these pitches, and I want a pitch to write a newsletter on this type of stuff. So stay tuned. It's gonna launch this fall, so we're gonna just, it's really just gonna be for normal people kind of trying to bridge that audience from people who are maybe curious about crypto, but really don't know why or how they should use it. You know, it's not going to be about token prices and bickering over l one theses. It's going to be about how do I use this stuff? So we'll see if there's an audience for it.
01:04:34.634 - 01:04:40.274, Speaker B: I could, I'd like to believe at some point people will be interested in it.
01:04:41.214 - 01:04:49.016, Speaker A: That's. That's awesome. It's awesome. Initiative. Totally agree. Like one. Yeah, we bigger too much about, like, it's getting worse, too on Twitter these days.
01:04:49.016 - 01:04:51.168, Speaker A: Just a lot of in fighting for no reason.
01:04:51.296 - 01:04:53.528, Speaker C: It's the bear market. Bear market vibes.
01:04:53.576 - 01:04:54.848, Speaker A: Bear market. Everything's flat.
01:04:54.896 - 01:05:05.312, Speaker B: I'm amazed how, like, they never take a fight off, like every, every, like, you don't have to chime in every time, but they do. They chime in on every single one. Oh.
01:05:05.328 - 01:05:33.562, Speaker A: Without fail, because we're all bored and nothing's going up. But I agree with you, too. Just, I'm building an app. I think it's time. I think the next bull run, the top 20 or 30 or whatever will be mostly applications that have a token that won't just be like l one s or other base level infra that people are getting excited about. At least I hope that's the case. I could be wrong, but it feels to me like a storm is brewing on the applications front.
01:05:33.738 - 01:05:56.624, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Solana is well positioned, too, just given all the speed. So I think we're in a good spot just to kind of attract consumer adoption. I'm definitely watching for all that stuff, and I feel like there's already little things, if you look hard enough, that are happening. So I'm excited to research those more, as I'm sure you guys are too.
01:05:57.524 - 01:06:08.424, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time, Brandon, and helping us dive into the world of liquid staking tokens on Solana from the current market leader, Marinade. It's been a really fun discussion.
01:06:09.284 - 01:06:18.604, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. This is a lot of fun. Thanks for all you're doing, educating and researching and all that. It's very valuable to the space. So thanks a lot.
