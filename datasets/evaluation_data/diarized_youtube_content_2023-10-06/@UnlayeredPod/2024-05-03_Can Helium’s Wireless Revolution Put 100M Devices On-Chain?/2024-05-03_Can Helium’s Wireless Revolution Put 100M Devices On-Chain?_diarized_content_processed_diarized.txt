00:00:14.200 - 00:00:25.674, Speaker A: Welcome to episode five of Unlayered. And before we get into the topic, Dave, I saw you've been active on Twitter these days, busting some myths, quelling some fud. What's been going on.
00:00:25.774 - 00:00:27.094, Speaker B: It's a full time job.
00:00:27.434 - 00:00:27.842, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:27.898 - 00:00:59.896, Speaker B: I mean there's been a few things, hard to narrow it down, but I think you're talking about. There was a thread someone put out yesterday, quite a long thread on the negative tokenomics, really around the deep end projects on Solana. So he covered hivemapper, helium and render and he just seemed to sort of made most of the stats up. He was claiming that one account held like 95% of the. Of the tokens in like two of the projects. It was just crazy talk, really. So I actually bothered to go into the numbers and clarify.
00:00:59.896 - 00:01:40.396, Speaker B: And I think on helium it was the biggest account, had about 1% of the tokens and the biggest five accounts held about 5%. So it was just miles off, completely off. Yeah, I think render, it was maybe 30% held by the largest accounts. I'm assuming that's treasury. I didn't look too close into it, but treasury and incentive rewards crucially. And then Hivemapper, which only went live about four months ago, that a large amount is held. But if you actually look at the tokenomics for Hivemapper, I just had a quick look and it seems that all the tokens are reserved for people who are contributing to the map.
00:01:40.396 - 00:02:00.678, Speaker B: So I'm not entirely sure what the VC's are receiving or if that was just excluded from their tokenomic summary, which would be very, very strange. I never have seen that before. So basically it's been live for four months and they are retaining almost all of their tokens because funnily enough, they want to pay people to contribute to building out this Google Map competitor.
00:02:00.806 - 00:02:16.444, Speaker A: Right, I guess was that guy's thesis. I didn't read the entire thread, but it seemed like his thesis was, oh, these VC's are holding basically all the supply and they just. They're going to dump it on retail or whatever. Was that kind of the gist of it? Or something more nefarious?
00:02:16.604 - 00:02:53.276, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Which is, I don't know, slightly ironic because I think it was an ethereum fan, I'm sorry to say. And interestingly at the moment I think optimism are about to. So they've got current circulating splits. It's one of these classic low float, high fdv, so high total valuation, but low circulating and optimism, they're about to more than double their circulating supply. Maybe today or maybe in the next few days. But someone did an interesting thread on that, and they said if you want to trade against that, you're basically trading against a 16 z.
00:02:53.276 - 00:03:34.492, Speaker B: All of the optimism insiders, and they've timed it for some good news basically as well, of course, counteract the sell pressure. He also had the example for Sui, which I think maybe 15% of the circulating supply is about to come through. And he said that one was less sturdy because the tokens which are coming in are for airdrop holders. So then you're only trading against retail. And also the good news that they've lined up is an ido on the same day. And it's like sue swap, which they valued like $200 million. And the photo that used for sue swap was in fact from Aptos swap.
00:03:34.492 - 00:03:54.924, Speaker B: They hadn't even changed the name on it or anything. So it seemed a sort of low quality way to try and pump sui tokens. So I think it's just one of those things, isn't it? Projects in the early stages have to deal with the release of tokens throughout those early years, and that's a difficult thing to manage, especially in a bull market.
00:03:55.044 - 00:04:19.040, Speaker A: But it was interesting that he called out all of these deep end projects because funny enough, we just happened to talk to a protocol developer for one of the bigger projects. But before we kind of intro him and get into that episode, would love to hear your thoughts, Dave, on how you see the deep in space. I know it's one of your favorite subsectors within crypto, and I think it's a very exciting area generally.
00:04:19.152 - 00:05:20.526, Speaker B: I think there's a very real chance that crypto can build out huge infrastructure projects using tokenomics. And it's one of these things where by sort of getting the general public to help grow these projects, rather than just using a centralized entity, you can legitimately lower costs, you can legitimately have a large community of contributors who are being incentivized with pseudo equity really in the project. And also the update speed or the growth speed is just so much faster. So something like Hivemapper, I think the global map which is being produced by Hivemapper, it's growing at something like 200 times the speed of Google Map. And because you're outsourcing to the general public, suddenly areas which maybe don't make financial sense for Google to go and map, maybe poorer developing areas around the.
00:05:20.550 - 00:05:21.886, Speaker A: World that last mile.
00:05:21.950 - 00:06:12.102, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, exactly. Suddenly you're not actually relying on sending someone, maybe on a us wage, to go and fly out to these places and then spending half a million on a car to go and drive around instead you can just get the local population to map it for you, you can update quicker. And then what does that mean for the user? It just means that they're going to be getting cheaper products because the capital costs of these projects is so, so, so much reduced from the centralized counterparts. So you're getting a cheaper product and generally you're getting better product, one that's being updated regularly. And I mean the total addressable market of some of these markets that they're going after, it's enormous. Like helium is 200 million market cap. And yeah, we're talking about helium today, 200 million market cap.
00:06:12.102 - 00:06:48.820, Speaker B: And I think I looked it up earlier, the market cap of all of the wireless providers around the world is like 2.5 trillion. So I mean helium currently occupies about 0.01% of the total addressable market, if you like. And yet it's built out the largest LoRaWAN or IoT network in the world. And it was also the fastest growing wireless network ever deployed. So to think that that currently only occupies one basis point of the entire total addressable market to me is crazy.
00:06:48.820 - 00:06:51.824, Speaker B: And I just think there has to be growth.
00:06:52.404 - 00:07:36.910, Speaker A: So much growth, a lot of potential energy there. Yeah, I mean, what excites me most about deep end on the similar point is just this idea that telecom providers today don't always have the strongest incentive to deploy capital to improve their networks. Oftentimes municipalities have specific laws that require a new potential competitor to be able to serve the entire district. It's either all or nothing. And so that's oftentimes why you see monopolies pop up in municipalities. There's a lot of reasons for that. But I think to your point about the last mile problem, deep in networks like helium or pollen or something like that, they don't have to adhere to these obscure, arbitrary laws.
00:07:36.910 - 00:08:13.716, Speaker A: If someone just decides that they want to put up a node for 5g or something like that, they can just do it even if they're on a farm far away from everybody else. And they get incentivized to do that specifically because they are a last mile person. It could be potentially extremely powerful, to your point, because of just how big this market is. And I think it's one of the most interesting use cases of crypto, which ultimately boils down to this incentivization mechanism for people to coordinate. And we're seeing the early experiments today. We're in the early innings, but I think we're learning a lot and projects like helium are kind of leading the charge right now.
00:08:13.900 - 00:09:23.854, Speaker B: I was listening to the Hivemapper CEO the other day on a podcast, and he made the point that currently all the vc money basically is focused on largely infrastructure, largely scaling ethereum, and outside of that, probably nfts is probably taking a large chunk of it. And yet there's very little investment, there's very little focus, if you go to a crypto conference, very little focus on deep end projects. And he's like, at some point, the investment in crypto has to reflect the real world economy. It has to reflect how large wireless providers are in the real world economy, how large gpu providers are in the real world economy. Because otherwise, if we're just focusing on these niche areas which don't necessarily correlate with how big industries are in the real world, then crypto is potentially doomed to always remain this niche product. I think it's valid, and I think surely over the next few years, this whole sector of deep in is bound to explode with both investment and rising demand and supply.
00:09:24.274 - 00:09:39.734, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think the AI move has also been kind of a tailwind for a lot of these deep end projects, your file coins of the world, your renders of the world. So a lot of interesting things happening simultaneously that I think could serve as tailwinds for this really exciting sector of crypto.
00:09:40.074 - 00:10:26.394, Speaker B: Yeah, just on the AI point, again, I heard Tushar from Multicoin say that in his view, one of the things we're certain amounts with the advent of AI is that the requirement for computing power will increase 100 times to a thousand times and maybe 10,000 times. So if you think that's the paradigm shift that we're going to be living through over the next 10, 20, 30 years, some of these projects, the market is going to grow. The AI market is going to grow, and that's going to drag a lot of the crypto market along with it because there's so many areas where it does marry really, really well with it. One of them being render, which is coming to Solana, which will help provide GPU power potentially for training and inference of AI models.
00:10:26.774 - 00:11:08.880, Speaker A: Absolutely. It just makes too much sense for crypto to serve as kind of a rail to power this stuff because to your point, 10,000 x, let's assume an increase in demand for computation in the cloud. Maybe the legacy players here, the AWS, is Google clouds of the world, can handle that demand, but I suspect we're going to need these decentralized networks to pick up the slack too. And it just makes a ton of sense from a developer standpoint. If you're making calls for computation power in the cloud, to use an Internet native currency versus trying to go through some centralized party and then settle with dollars or whatever currency you're using, it just feels like a much clunkier way to do things.
00:11:09.032 - 00:11:40.400, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And obviously the token also has the dual benefit of incentivizing people. Yeah, I'm looking forward to June 5 when Apple are going to release their new VR AR goggles. That could be another push forward in technology. It might get the metaverse coins running, and I'm sure it's just going to keep on increasing this drive for GPU and this meshing of AI and V VR. And it's crazy, crazy time we're living through.
00:11:40.552 - 00:12:05.752, Speaker A: No doubt, no doubt. Yeah. We'll have to do an episode on just that kind of side of crypto. Today we are talking with Noah, head of protocol engineering at Helium foundation. You can find Noah on Twitter. He is at redacted underscore Noah. And prior to his work at helium, he was the founder of Strata Protocol, which was a protocol for creating tokens on Solana.
00:12:05.752 - 00:12:22.936, Speaker A: Obviously very knowledgeable and super interesting conversation from the perspective of a builder in this burgeoning deep in space. Welcome, Noah. Thanks for joining us today.
00:12:23.080 - 00:12:24.368, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:12:24.456 - 00:12:39.164, Speaker A: For sure, for sure. I actually am curious, why don't I kind of dig in a bit on the Amstrada, your history there. From what I understand, they did social tokens on Solana. What was that experience like? How did you get into that side of crypto?
00:12:39.284 - 00:13:25.254, Speaker C: Yeah, it accidentally became my specialty. So when I was originally looking at Solana, it was just because my brother was working at Solana, so I kind of wanted to play around with it. I wanted to learn rust and kind of, if you talk to anybody, you'll hear that I'm a very firm believer in, you have to do something, you have to actually go build something. So anytime I'm looking to learn a new language, learn a new framework, I'm like, all right, what's going to be my toy project? Am I going to build a fake Twitter? At the time when I started with this stuff, bit clout was going off. I was like, oh, social tokens. This is really cool. This is an interesting way for creators to monetize.
00:13:25.254 - 00:14:03.352, Speaker C: How would I build it on Solana? So it was kind of a theoretical thing, and I started hacking with it on the weekend, and I figured I didn't want to build Twitter, so I would just overlay the tokens on Twitter itself, right? Yeah. And it just kind of took off from there. I put it in a hackathon, and then all of a sudden we had investors and I ended up quitting my job in finance. It was a whirlwind, but it eventually became strata because we realized, like, we actually. Social tokens are like the epitome of launching a token. It has to be one click, it has to be super easy. And so we ended up building a lot of infrastructure that made it super easy to launch tokens.
00:14:03.352 - 00:14:25.338, Speaker C: And I think that NFTs kind of became the way that creators build a community and monetize in crypto. I don't think social tokens really won that war. And so we kind of pivoted to this token launchpad thing, and then we happened to pivot to a token launchpad at the beginning of a bear market where people aren't launching many tokens.
00:14:25.466 - 00:14:35.162, Speaker A: So help us understand, though. So you kind of started your journey into crypto, let's say, with strata protocol. How did you find your way over to working on helium?
00:14:35.298 - 00:15:20.894, Speaker C: Yeah, so that was fortuitous. I got a guardian angel somewhere, but it just happened to be that a lot of the stuff that we were experimenting with at strata were things that helium was trying to build near the tail end of strata. Where are the purposes for launching a token? One of the major purposes is creating a dao. I think people have generally been finding that daos eventually lead to the need for sub daos because just too much going on at once. We had actually started experimenting with grape protocol, having subdows within grape using strata bonding curves. And helium is now fully sub dialed up. They have an IoT sub dial and they have a mobile subdal.
00:15:20.894 - 00:15:52.332, Speaker C: And the way those tokens relate to each other is actually similar to a strata bonding curve. It's just one way. So with the strata bonding curve, you could buy tokens and it would mint them. Then you could burn tokens and get back the reserves. With helium treasuries, you can take IoT tokens and you can burn them in exchange for helium, uh, hnt tokens, but you can't go the other way around. So you can only get IoT tokens by earning them via mining. So it's kind of similar, but also kind of different.
00:15:52.332 - 00:16:20.384, Speaker C: So we weren't necessarily able to like, reuse all the contracts, but we had experience in building this kind of thing. And also helium just, they needed a, they needed a solana native team to go and, you know, build this, because, like, it is hard enough to get past the learning curve on solana, but to get past the learning curve on solana and then try to go zero to 100 on something that was built over the course of three or four years, that would be insanity.
00:16:24.804 - 00:16:55.644, Speaker B: Obviously. Helium is a decentralized physical infrastructure network, which I think on this show we're really interested in, and bullish about their prospects over the next few years as they grow. Arguably, the first one was being bitcoin itself that was relying on a distributed group of nodes, if you like, around the world. So just wondering on what your thoughts are really on deep end projects as a category, and are you bullish on them and what do you see as their main strengths?
00:16:55.724 - 00:17:39.452, Speaker C: I mean, to me, it's one of the most bullish things in crypto right now. I'd at the tail end of strata there come out of some burnout from just like, the amount of noise that's getting launched in crypto, right? Like, NFT projects that do nothing, tokens that do absolutely nothing. And, like, I don't mean this to say like, I'm this huge skeptic and, like, you know, there's no value in the community that they create. But, like, when helium came to me and like, just like, oh, here's this thing that actually has physical devices, a network that's deployed, that has this. This built in actual utility. It's not fake, it's not based off of nothing. It's not based on the crater full theory.
00:17:39.452 - 00:18:25.644, Speaker C: It's literally providing a service that people need, which is something really cool that deepin in general is able to accomplish. And then the other really interesting thing about helium was it hit scaling problems. And I come from data, I love scaling problems. It hit scaling problems with, with blockchain in general. So it's like, oh, this is like a really, really cool cross section of skills. And, yeah, I mean, you're seeing helium come to Solana, you're seeing render come to Solana, you're seeing, I think I just saw this thing called Tal. We're about to probably just see a boom of these things on Solana because it, you know, it makes more sense to have a general purpose blockchain because you can lean on all of the integrations, right? So, you know, helium has an workapool, they have radium.
00:18:25.644 - 00:19:09.902, Speaker C: There's just a ton of integrations that we have building the protocol. We were able to use clockwork and switchboard and PIf and a whole bunch of other things. So you have a lot there. And I'm actually really interested in building out a deep end toolkit for Solana because we solved a lot of the problems for helium and a lot of them we solved in a generic way. And so post launch, post taking one blockchain and shoving it into another, in the interest of bug fixes, some of the stuff got a little less generic. But I'd like to at some point make it more generic again so that we can make it way, way easier for people to go and launch a deep end project on solana.
00:19:10.078 - 00:19:23.324, Speaker B: And just for the benefit of our listeners, do you want to just explain maybe how helium's IoT network functions, how it's been able to grow this network, what the factors are that's helped it scale?
00:19:24.064 - 00:20:04.494, Speaker C: The simple idea here is you have some kind of signal that you want to cover the world in, whether that be 5g or IoT. What is the best way to get that deployed? The traditional way of deploying it. If you talk about cell phones, they put up cell phone towers. In order to have a cell phone tower, you have to go and lease that land from somebody and then actually go and build it. But what if you just let people do it, right? So I can just go and take this thing, I can shove it on the roof of my house, and now I'm providing signal for the people in my area. Now why would I do that? Why would I provide signal for everybody? I'm selfish. We all are.
00:20:04.494 - 00:20:50.574, Speaker C: I do it because I mine tokens. And so like the very original helium setup was you throw this IoT, which is a special kind of signal that goes like 100 miles. It's really good for like low power sensors, things like that. And you put it on your rooftop and you mine HnT in exchange for providing the signal. And then people that are going and using the signal basically burn HNT into data credits that they can then use. So it's this like closed system where people are buying the token in order to get data, and then people are earning the token in order for it because they provide the data. Now it got a little bit more complicated because now we have multiple signal types.
00:20:50.574 - 00:21:09.920, Speaker C: And so you want IoT, you want 5g signal, maybe you eventually want wifi signal. And so it came up with these subdals and these sub tokens where it's still very much the same model. You're still mining tokens in exchange for providing coverage. There's just now multiple of them, and they're kind of subgrouped.
00:21:09.992 - 00:22:16.224, Speaker A: So I think it makes sense for something like putting on 5g service, very capital intensive for like a corporation to do it. Verizon at and t these guys are going to drag their feet for an eternity to give people fast Internet, whether it's through cables, whether it's through 5g, putting out towers. So I get the benefit in terms of relying on decentralized network, relying on people to put these on their houses or wherever their apartments. That makes sense. I think one of the key sticking points that I struggle with sometimes is that how does the demand side of that equation work? Where in the US a lot of people have access to broadband, they have access to 4g or 5g depending where they're at. And so the lack of like huge improvement over their existing lives to switch over to something like getting their phone service through maybe helium or some other provider, I feel like that makes it hard to incent these capital deployers, let's call them, who are running these nodes to then bootstrap the network. I just feel like is there certain markets where this might actually take off faster? Are you seeing adoption even in the US?
00:22:16.604 - 00:23:29.964, Speaker C: Yeah, a couple of things there. The first thing is helium mobile is actually they have this agreement with T Mobile where you go and use the helium network as much as you can, which is actually one of the big benefits of it is it is cheaper to use, so the data is cheaper, so you want to use it as much as possible. And then when you fall out, you roam onto the T mobile network so you have all the same coverage plus some more coverage, which is why you would want to use it. Now the reason this is important is because 5G is fundamentally different than, you know, like 4g. It has a really, really short range and it actually gets impeded by things like buildings. And so it's a really hard signal to get that last mile, which is why you basically only see 5g in major cities because it's like really hard to coat an area in this stuff. And so you've got this like really low range thing and these cell phone companies literally have to go like lease from whoever owns this building, this 1 m² plot on top of the building to put up this radio.
00:23:29.964 - 00:24:01.904, Speaker C: So it's much easier for something like helium to get in there because there's no negotiating a lease. Or at least if someone's negotiating the lease, they're kind of doing it on their own so that they can go put a helium hotspot up there. It's also way easier to get this into lower income communities where maybe Verizon's not really going to prioritize the lower income community, because they're not buying 5g capable phones, but the community themselves could invest in putting up a helium hotspot and now they actually have 5g.
00:24:01.984 - 00:24:40.776, Speaker B: Yeah, because you're saving, aren't you, on the land that a Verizon would have to go out and buy, you're saving on or the leases or whatever, but you're also saving on the hardware, aren't you? Because the people who put up these hotspots on their roofs, they're actually buying the hardware from helium. So in terms of capital upfront requirements for a company to come in, it's just sort of transformational, isn't it? Compared to pre crypto token incentive days where you would need, I don't know, 5000 million. I have no idea how much it's going to cost to build this out. Whereas presumably helium can do it incredibly cheaply.
00:24:40.940 - 00:25:28.764, Speaker C: Yeah, well, and even better than that, it's the hotspots themselves aren't even coming from helium. There are a bunch of manufacturers, we call them makers, that make these hotspots. And so there's actually incredible competition amongst all these manufacturers to get the price as low as humanly possible because, like people are trying to make the best bang for their buck. Like how much can I mine versus how much did I pay for this hotspot? So, like in the Iot realm, I'm pretty sure we're going to get down to like $100 hotspots here pretty soon, which is pretty incredible when you think about it, because I think originally these things were like 400 something dollars. So you get like, yeah, you just get better deployment across all facets. And the whole thing is community governed. And so it's very open to see how these things are working.
00:25:28.764 - 00:25:40.352, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's definitely a lot of efficiency gains to be had and it kind of helps solve that chicken and egg problem because crypto allows you to grow the community much faster than traditional means.
00:25:40.488 - 00:26:04.044, Speaker A: So let's say, for instance, I'm in New York City and I want to be a node operator for five g. Am I setting this up in my apartment? And then who is the ISP at the end of the day, am I connecting this to my existing modem and I'm using getting cable from Time Warner or something like that? Who are the stakeholders here at play? And then there's someone connecting to this node, theoretically, like, to your point, who's using maybe helium mobile.
00:26:04.164 - 00:26:31.954, Speaker C: Yeah, so we are. Helium is explicitly not an ISP. Right. It's the wireless signal, it's not the ISP. So people connect these through a variety of ISP's. If you were like in New York and you have Comcast and you plug the ethernet cable into, you know, your IoT hotspot, then it's relaying through Comcast or at and T or whoever you have. And so like, yeah, if you're setting one of these things up you should make sure your ISP allows this type of thing.
00:26:32.294 - 00:27:15.152, Speaker B: Something which strikes me is something like bitcoin. It needs all of these nodes to be geographically distributed for the decentralization properties basically. Whereas something like helium, it needs them not for that so much as the distribution. If you're going to create a wireless network you want it to have as much coverage as possible. And yet you talk quite often during this interview about subdaos, daos, community ownership. So do you think even though it's distributed not necessarily for decentralization purposes, but do you think it is really important that the network is decentralized and is in the hands of the community as opposed to centrally controlled?
00:27:15.328 - 00:27:47.256, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I don't want to get like tinfoil Hattie, but like it is, I think pretty important that these things are decentralized because then no one entity can just go and shut it off. Right. And having freedom of communication ways is really important. I'd love to see ISP's get decentralized too because that's the one thing this is kind of missing. But there's just only so much that you can do there that's some like real. That's a really hard problem. But yeah, I mean even helium like it incentivizes distributing things geographically.
00:27:47.256 - 00:27:55.986, Speaker C: So if you're like, you know, if there's already ten hotspots by you and you put up like the 11th one, you're not going to make very much. And actually you make everybody in your grid earn less.
00:27:56.050 - 00:27:56.694, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:58.714 - 00:28:27.064, Speaker C: So it kind of incentivizes not crowding, which is, you know, kind of an interesting thing because people in helium community will actually like message each other and be like, hey, if you like, if you move your hotspot over like 500ft, we'll be covering two grids. It's like, it's actually more like people are more, you know, genial about it than you would think, which is nice. Yeah, it's not people like, I'm gonna kick your door down.
00:28:28.444 - 00:28:29.620, Speaker A: Not yet. Not yet.
00:28:29.652 - 00:28:30.344, Speaker C: Anyway.
00:28:36.804 - 00:29:11.656, Speaker B: Just wondering on the Iot network, because prior to helium, am I right in thinking that there wasn't an Iot network? Really? Because maybe the revenue that you can actually receive from these small Iot tracking devices, the revenue tends to be quite low. And obviously, to set up an entire wireless network is capitally intensive. Prior to helium, so was this the first Iot network? And how does the company see the future, really, of that space? Are they seeing a lot of growth, really, since helium has been set up up?
00:29:11.800 - 00:29:47.344, Speaker C: Yeah. So generally what people used to do is, let's say you were trying to set up tracking inside a shipping warehouse. What people used to do is they would just go deploy their own Iot network. So they would go deploy a bunch of hotspots around the warehouse, or they're setting up farming sensors. They would go deploy a bunch of hotspots around the farm and then they would own their own network. And it was just closed there thing, and then you would put sensors on it. And there are actually still to this day, companies that specialize in, I think, deploying these small networks for your particular use case.
00:29:47.344 - 00:30:19.206, Speaker C: Of course, this breaks down if you want to do something like package tracking inside a UPS truck, because now you're going across the United States. So you'd have to plant these down everywhere. I think that's the problem that the original people at Nova Labs saw. They're like, oh, well, if we want to deploy sensors, we need to have a network first. And how do we spread this network as much as possible? And so, yeah, now helium is the largest IoT network and I don't think anything else even comes close.
00:30:19.390 - 00:30:45.854, Speaker A: Gotcha. Can we maybe drill down a bit into. And I think you touched on it before, but the incentivization through tokens, which is, I guess, the key kind of differentiator that blockchains bring to this sector we call Deepin. Like, how does helium think about that? Introducing the token, incentivizing people with it, avoiding issues with dilution and ensuring, like, this whole ecosystem is balanced.
00:30:46.674 - 00:31:19.140, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's a really hard problem. Right. So you have to make sure that people are properly incentivized. You have to make sure that things aren't getting diluted too much, and you also have to make sure that Gensler doesn't kick your door down. And so I'm a little bit nervous to even answer questions about the tokens on a podcast for that reason, because I just. There are legal issues abound with tokens, but I think helium does a very.
00:31:19.172 - 00:32:07.846, Speaker B: Good job of it, if I understand it correctly. I think that there is one token which is more like a stablecoin. I was just listening to a podcast, I think, with Amir talking about it and he said that the multicoin guys had suggested it purely because if you're an enterprise institution and you want to interact with the helium network, you don't want to be holding highly volatile crypto assets on your balance sheet. And so I think the guys at Multicoin had encouraged them early on to move to like a dual token setup is how I understand it, just to try and get past that pain point of expecting normies and big corporations to be holding crypto. So yeah, it seemed a sensible idea and I think render as well are following it as far as I understand.
00:32:08.030 - 00:32:46.660, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's called the data credit. Yeah, I think it's great because actually a lot of people that are using the sensor network, they don't even know or care that the thing is crypto. Like the miners care about the crypto because they're earning crypto. But we have this data credits portal now that was built by sphere where you can literally just load up on data credits via paying with credit card. And so you can just buy 1000 data credits, which will give you plenty, and then just have your sensors use that and you don't even have to know that crypto is going on, which is great for cost prediction because you know that one data credit maybe equals 1 mb or something over the network. That's not the actual thing.
00:32:46.660 - 00:33:30.256, Speaker C: I don't know the actual conversion. But it's much easier to plan versus if you're talking about if you had to pay for the network usage in terms of HNT. Now, hnt was $50, and then hnt goes down. Now all of a sudden it's hard to plan these things. Then the question becomes, okay, well, how do you still tie that to the success of the network? And so the way it works is the data credit itself is pinned to a dollar value, but you have to burn HNT, a dollar value, amount of HNT to get that data credit. So that's actually where on Solana pith comes in, where Pith says, hey, HNT is worth $1.50 right now.
00:33:30.256 - 00:34:34.290, Speaker C: So if you want, I think it's with five decimals. But like if you want 1500 data credits, you go and burn 15 HNT or something like that. I did the math horribly wrong there. But you get the idea, you burn HNT, which makes HNT deflationary on the long tail of things, and you get data credits. It's really interesting what happens to this model at the end time, because right now helium is inflationary because we are still actively having HNT tokens be minted by the protocol into these subdao treasuries, and the subdals themselves are issuing or they're having tokens minted for mining rewards. But what happens is, as time goes on, similar to bitcoin, the rewards keep happening, happening and happening and happening. And what happens is at some point, the amount of data credits, like the amount of HNT getting burned for data credits, is actually more than the amount of HNT getting issued.
00:34:34.290 - 00:35:23.533, Speaker C: And so there's this really interesting concept called net emissions, which tries to keep HNT deflationary, but allows that HNT that's getting burned for data credits to then be resent out to the miners. And so what you get is, after 50 years or so, the whole system is actually completely closed. It's a closed loop. People burn HNT in order to pay for network usage, and the miners get exactly that back. Right. Like, it's zero. Money in equals money out, which is what you want, obviously, when you're trying to bootstrap a network and you're trying to grow it, these tokens are being issued kind of in an inflationary manner, because your incentive, you're basically using that to grow the network, and that is your incentive to grow the network faster.
00:35:23.533 - 00:35:34.074, Speaker C: In a way, all these people that are mining the tokens, if they hold onto the tokens, are taking a stake in the network, and that also gives them ability to vote and things like that.
00:35:40.894 - 00:36:03.200, Speaker A: So helium had a good problem in that. Too much activity, congestion, whatever you want to call it, but needed to make a change. And they made that move to Solana, but would love to learn a bit more contextually, like, how did Helium decide to do Solana? Why not appchain or l two or something like that? What was it about Solana that made the most sense for Helium's transition?
00:36:03.392 - 00:36:52.140, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I can speak to it a little bit, but I'm the guy that they came to after they decided Solana. Sure, obviously, I'm a Solana Maxi, but no, I think originally when they went and built this thing, I think was like, what? Like 2017 or 2019, I can't remember when they launched their blockchain, but the only option available for general purpose blockchain was eth. And they kind of correctly assumed they were like, this is going to get way too expensive for the amount of transactions that we're trying to run through it, so we need to build our own. That was not necessarily true anymore in 2022. Right. It's very, very hard as the Solana core devs and all the validators can tell you very, very hard to maintain a blockchain. This was getting to be a drag, and it wasn't really helium's core tenet.
00:36:52.140 - 00:37:48.974, Speaker C: Helium's core tenet is to cover the world and signal and be the people's network and provide Internet. It's not to be the people's blockchain. So, yeah, they went looking at, what are all the alternatives? And there are tons of them. And every time you said Solana, there'd be a bunch of people screaming, well, why not hit arrow? Why not this? Why not that? But the reality is that if you look at the blockchain ecosystem, there's just not that many that are actually able to do the kind of volume that Solana is able to handle. And there are a bunch of them claiming to be able to do it, but none of them have been battle tested quite as hard as Solana. Solana had the NFT hype go through it and all these botters and all, like, just all of the insanity of the hype. And it did go down a few times, but now it's kind of grown from that.
00:37:48.974 - 00:38:07.322, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's a lot of reasons. I think most of them are outlined and I think it's. I don't know, it's hip. 70 something was the transition to Solana. I think there's also another hip where somebody was proposing a different blockchain. Um, but I mean, you know, you look at render and render is coming here, too. Like, it just.
00:38:07.322 - 00:38:38.044, Speaker C: It makes sense. There's, there's an entire ecosystem to compose around. It's not like Solana is this, like, you know, brand new thing, right? Like, you know, swe and aptos are kind of similar, right? But they're just, they're brand new. Like, helium is not going to go to a completely new chain with. With nothing built on it yet. Right? So, yeah, at the risk of, you know, maxis of other chains hearing this podcast and bludgeoning me, which they always do. They always will.
00:38:38.044 - 00:38:42.760, Speaker C: No, your argument is stupid. Algorithm scales better than Solana.
00:38:42.792 - 00:38:43.564, Speaker A: Oh, God.
00:38:44.104 - 00:38:50.680, Speaker C: And, like, I don't know, maybe. Maybe it does, but we're here and we built the stuff and I like Solana.
00:38:50.752 - 00:39:35.460, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think that's a very salient point that I want to just underscore a bit, is that, yes, there's other blockchains that could theoretically do a lot of transactions, but Solana is literally the only one that survived 2021, which was a crazy year in terms of the NFTs, just the general bull market vibes. And it got through a lot of the issues that it struggled with in the early outages. And it seems like it's weathered the storm, so to speak. And it's here. And the other point you made is it has a lot of projects ancillary to it. That's my next question is what else do you guys rely on in this lana ecosystem? You brought up pith, you brought up orca. Does that also dovetail with your broader thesis as to why it's a good ecosystem to build in?
00:39:35.612 - 00:40:27.920, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Literally every day I'm using something that somebody else has built. I think the incredible thing about the actual protocol side, so the smart contracts, there is dozens of engineers involved in the entire transition, especially Nova labs, helped out a ton with the Oracles and deciding who gets what rewards, but the actual smart contracts. So like helium program library, built by basically three people in six months, which is insane, right? Like helium itself has been years and years and years in the making building all this stuff. And the only reason only possible on Solana is because we were able to make use of all these things. So we needed to get the number of active devices sent to the blockchain so that we could use it in subdao rewards calculation, which by the way is completely new, didn't exist on the old chain. Just use switchboard.
00:40:27.920 - 00:40:52.762, Speaker C: We need pricing information. Could have used switchboard, but has better publishers. We use pith for that. We needed the system to basically have a heartbeat. It's like a circulatory system where tokens are going out every single day. Clockwork heartbeat right there. It literally since launch at UTC midnight every day it's just been trucking.
00:40:52.762 - 00:41:09.346, Speaker C: And I don't even check it anymore because it's so reliable. Trying to think, oh, squads. Right. We don't want to have a single key managing our programs or any of the configurations. So we have squads. We wanted to have Dallas and voting. Well, realms already exists.
00:41:09.346 - 00:42:05.344, Speaker C: Like basically everything that you could possibly want to do, there's pretty much a plugin available for it. And long term, I'd like to see that happen with DpiN too. We built a bunch of bespoke stuff to issue rewards to miners, but we also did that in a generic way so other people can go and use it. Because the idea is rewards just accumulate to an NFT, and that NFT represents your ownership of whatever the physical miner is, and then you can go and claim those rewards. But that's a generalized model. Anybody can use that render could issue an NFT for each GPU cluster Solana makes it a lot easier because there are a bunch of companies, oh, helios too, webhooks, to get our data and be able to actually use it, because Solana is basically a really fancy NoSQL database, which is great for point queries but terrible for any kind of other query.
00:42:05.794 - 00:42:54.474, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels like for maybe the last year, there's been a big narrative in crypto about app chains are going to be the future. Obviously, dy DX have moved over to create theirs. But it's always seems strange to me that there hasn't been so much of a narrative about the fact that helium are basically moving from their own app chain, if you like, to a general purpose blockchain. And yeah, you've just talked around a lot of the advantages that you get when you make that move. Do you have any thoughts on how you think that will go in the future? About when protocols become big or whatever? Do you think that there will be major advantages of moving to app chains, or do you think the composability that you get on general purpose blockchains will prove more useful?
00:42:54.894 - 00:43:14.166, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's just a matter of. I mean, yeah, helium didn't want to do its own app chain because, like, know, the collective sigh of, oh, my God, managing another blockchain was like, I'm telling you, like, you know, people talk about app chains like, it's easy to maintain a blockchain. I'm promising you it is not.
00:43:14.270 - 00:43:14.814, Speaker A: No way.
00:43:14.894 - 00:43:28.462, Speaker C: And so, like, I don't know. It's a question of. It's a question of volume. Right. And what you're trying to accomplish. You know, I think we just saw, like, Cube, uh, announced that is, you know, kind of building an exchange and it's based on Solana. But I'm pretty sure they're not using Solana.
00:43:28.462 - 00:43:49.512, Speaker C: Exactly. They're using their own, like, cluster of it. Why? Because they want low latency and high throughput. And so maybe a lot of these nodes are going to be geographically located, close to each other, so they can have quicker block times or something like that. In that context, yeah, it totally makes sense to have your own chain. And DydX is a similar case. They have a lot of volume.
00:43:49.512 - 00:44:39.660, Speaker C: They want to get latency down. It makes sense for them to do their own app chain, but every single company needs to look at it. And you really have to look at, is my volume legitimate? I was arguing with someone on Twitter earlier who was talking about updating their NFT once a second. And my question when I see something like that is, do you really need to be hitting the blockchain once a second? That seems like a bad design. And indeed, helium had this same exact problem. It's like, well, we want to issue rewards every 15 minutes, so now we need to send tokens to all million wallets on helium every 15 minutes. A million transactions every 15 minutes, right? Like, no, no, don't do things like that.
00:44:39.660 - 00:45:30.058, Speaker C: So, like, a lot of the time the answer is like, of why you can't build on a composable general purpose train is because you just need to like switch your view and be like, okay, maybe let's. The thing that's limiting us, maybe let's not do it the way helium does it now is all of the rewards accumulate to an NFT. But that's happening via decentralized oracles. The oracles have an idea of what each NFT is owned. The blockchain doesn't have any idea of what they're owed until the oracle tells them. The oracle only needs to tell them when somebody wants to go claim their rewards. So when I want to go claim my ten Iot that are sitting on my miners, then the oracle needs to go and write down to the blockchain, hey, this thing has earned ten Iot in its lifetime.
00:45:30.058 - 00:46:30.510, Speaker C: And then the blockchain knows that you've only claimed zero in its lifetime, so I can let you claim the difference. And indeed, even pith is going to this model now, where the generalized, the current or implementation of pith on Solana is just sending data to the blockchain. But Pithnet and the new implementation of pith says, hey, the client needs to go request from Pithnet to write to the blockchain. And it can actually do that in the same transaction and say, in this transaction, Oracle says, price is this, it signed it, now go do my HNT to data credit swap. And it's actually better because that price in that transaction is the freshest, priced down to milliseconds as opposed to, yeah, it was written to the blockchain a half second ago, before your transaction ran. So this idea of doing things lazily is way better for scalability. And I think with blockchain at least currently being such a limited resource that, I'm sorry, even solmaxis, it can't scale horizontally.
00:46:30.510 - 00:47:01.980, Speaker C: It literally cannot. So we can't just shove infinite things through it. You can't just hit it once a second. You can't hit it every 15 minutes with a million transactions. And even if you run your own app chain sure, that's going to work for a while, but as helium found out, I mean, originally they were running a chain, literally, on the miners. You hit scaling issues. So my opinion is it generally makes sense to design your architecture around not spamming the fuck out of the blockchain.
00:47:01.980 - 00:47:22.492, Speaker C: Uh, and then you can totally use a general purpose one. Um, because the really important thing is the ownership primitives, right, and the ownership primitives are on Solana, and once you have them, anybody can do whatever they want with them. And that's where kind of the, the volume comes from. It shouldn't come from your protocol, just spamming for the sake of spam.
00:47:22.628 - 00:48:02.416, Speaker B: I was actually in the, um, the render telegram when they said that they were thinking about moving to Solana. And a lot of the complaints that you had from people where, of course, our Solana is always down, which is a whole subject in and of itself. But I think what you've just been describing there, it shows that that's not the core priority, if I understand correctly, of these deep end projects, because the money is only coming to the hotspot when they actually demand it from the blockchain. So if a blockchain does, heaven forbid, go down for 12 hours, again, all that's doing, am I correct in thinking, is just. That would just delay the time that someone could claim their rewards?
00:48:02.600 - 00:48:37.704, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly what happens. There's all sorts of problems that come with doing this oracle based approach, because you need to find a way to decentralize the oracles. And maybe with the future of computing, we find a way to scale blockchains horizontally and then this isn't a problem anymore. But for now, the design is really robust. Helium has oracles that are calculating the rewards if Solar Solana goes down. Sure, you can't send your tokens or claim your tokens for a little bit, but once it comes back up, you're fine. I also just don't really see, I mean, someone's going to quote this, but I don't see Solana going down for 12 hours again.
00:48:37.704 - 00:49:16.220, Speaker C: I think it's just a ton of work has gone into making it more reliable to the point I made earlier. I trust the things that have been battle tested over the things that haven't. It's really cheap for someone to come in from, you know, one of these newer chains and be like, hey, we can handle the volume. We did a test where we tested ddos ing it. Yeah, but your test didn't have thousands of dgens where there were literally companies whose entire purpose was to sell degens of botting scripts. Like, they were. There were hundreds of different botting scripts and people were rating which one spammed Solana better because it made you have a better chance of, like, getting to bit.
00:49:16.220 - 00:49:24.172, Speaker C: Like, it was absolute fucking madness. And if you think that you can test that and simulate that, I'm sorry, you're wrong. You just can't.
00:49:24.228 - 00:49:47.052, Speaker A: Like, it is reminding me of, like, that whole industry in sneakers where, like, people sell these sneaker bots, like, cyber soul, and there's like, a bunch of other ones, like five k per bot, just so you can, like, snipe some yeezys when they drop. You need to be able to battle those guys. Then you could tell me your blockchain scale. But until you deal with that, like, these tests mean nothing. That's what I'm taking away from all this.
00:49:47.188 - 00:50:13.740, Speaker C: Yeah. And, like, I think some other blockchains have actually had, you know, these giant events. Right? And, like, like, obviously Eth. Like, Eth is more battle tested than Solana. And, like, I'm not going to pretend that it's not. And if, like, your highest priority is uptime, like, eth prioritizes liveness over everything, literally over everything. So, like, if that's your requirement, then you just have to kind of go and, you know, eat the extra cost.
00:50:13.740 - 00:50:45.884, Speaker C: Helium wasn't going to do that. Right? Because it would have cost, you know, fucking like $5 to mint each hotspot, which is extremely expensive, and then it would have cost people a few dollars every single time they go and claim their rewards. Uh, and at that point, like, you're, you know, the rewards that you're claiming are not worth the amount that you're spending in transaction fees. It just wasn't possible. And I think that Solana will get to a point where it is as reliable as Eth. It just needs to have the crap beaten out of it until totally feels comfortable removing the beta.
00:50:46.664 - 00:51:29.464, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, the analogy I always make because you bring up that point about liveness on ETH is just look at the other deeds mint. And people were paying thousands of dollars for a transaction that did not mint the NFT. And so they would lose, like, two k, not minute. And all right, you're out of luck because that's just how much it costs to post the ETH blockchain at this time. So totally get that kind of philosophical difference between people in that ecosystem versus builders in Solana. I guess, like, quick follow up is because you mentioned, like, a collective sigh of doing this on an app chain. What was the reaction when Helium did decide to move over to Solana? Was there some skepticism? Has the community embraced Solana at this point?
00:51:29.624 - 00:52:05.714, Speaker C: I think the community has embraced it at this point. I mean, it's a pretty different experience when you go from. I mean, even helium was slower than Solana, right? I think you had to wait. I mean, I wasn't that familiar with it because I came on later, but I think it was like 30 seconds to a minute for a transaction to go through, whereas, like, now it's mediate. So, as anything is, there's, there's a lot of noise. And I have been paying way more acutely to the issues that people are having because I want to get rid of them. But it seems like we've gotten to the point now where the fever has mostly broken and people are able to go and claim the rewards.
00:52:05.714 - 00:52:34.286, Speaker C: There's literally hundreds of thousands of transactions a day of people going and claiming the rewards. Things are working, and I think people like it. As far as the core teams, I think that people were definitely happy with not having to go and maintain a blockchain anymore. It was, you know, the blockchain was also written in Erlang, which is a really cool language for distributed systems. But, like, good luck finding people that can maintain it.
00:52:34.430 - 00:52:37.594, Speaker A: Good luck finding any stack overflow posts on that.
00:52:38.214 - 00:52:57.744, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, like, it's a cool language, and, like, I like elixir too, which is kind of like built on top of it, but it's certainly not on, you know, stack overflows. Languages people are most excited about. You know, it's probably sitting there next to COBOL, whereas, like, rust, people are very excited about.
00:52:58.284 - 00:53:19.024, Speaker A: I think one of the big sort of challenges developers face who want to do smart contract programming is just the difficulty of programming on something like Solana versus solidity, or even using these move blockchains and the move programming languages. What's your journey been like onboarding as a smart contract programmer into Solana from your experience?
00:53:19.464 - 00:54:02.064, Speaker C: Yeah. So it used to be that programming on Solana was just absolutely painful and not even because of the data model. So, like, learning Solana's data model itself right now, that is what makes it harder than solidity, because I promise it's not that much harder with anchor. Like, the rust is minimal. Like, I encourage front end devs to do it often because you don't need to be like this egghead like, back end dev that really understands pointers and memory usage and things like that to write smart contracts on Solana, not with anchor, you don't. But, like, back in the day when I was learning anchor didn't even exist. And literally, like, anything you wanted to do was, like, balancing a checkbook.
00:54:02.064 - 00:54:42.816, Speaker C: Like, you had to repeat the same list of accounts, like, 17 times. And if, God forbid, you passed one wrong account in the wrong order, it would just throw an error that said, basically, f you. Because there was no, like, it's not like, you know, this specific account was off, but it's gotten so much easier now. And I really looked at move. It's cool, it's elegant. It's maybe slightly easier to write than anchor, but also, to me, I find those things as a real anti selling point. When I was working in data infra, the only reason that I even looked at Solana was because data infra was starting to do more stuff in rust, because the deterministic memory usage is way better.
00:54:42.816 - 00:55:07.214, Speaker C: And I wanted to learn Rust. Like, Rust was my gateway drug into Solana. I never would have touched eth. I knew about solidity. I knew about blockchain forever. My co founder at Strata was, like, into blockchain in 2015, 2016, and telling me to get into it. I was like, nope, don't want to pin my career to this weird, obscure language called solidity that nobody uses anywhere other than blockchain.
00:55:07.214 - 00:55:56.164, Speaker C: F that. So, like, I actually, people will fight me on this, and I fought people on Twitter about this, but I actually think that Rust is a huge selling point for Solana, and not having some specific esoteric blockchain language is actually better because people don't feel like they're pinning their career to it now. I'm sorry, get a spoil this, but if you're using Rust and anchor on Solana, you really don't have to be a rust expert, and you're really not going to learn Rust that well. And so I larp as a rust developer, but I'm really not. I write smart contracts in Rust, but it's, again, Armani and friends have removed so much of the glass from it that it is kind of like its own language at this point.
00:55:56.464 - 00:56:08.124, Speaker A: It's a good point. You bring up bigger pool developers that are interested in that language versus just blockchain languages, where I feel like a new one's coming out every week just in the ZK world, which is, which is crazy to see.
00:56:08.504 - 00:56:58.878, Speaker C: And I feel like this is better, right? This is kind of, it's more like a ruby and ruby on rails relationship, right? Where, like, anchor is ruby on rails and, you know, rust is ruby, and that to me is a much better model. And it means that, like, there are people that are building alternatives to anchor. Someone's building like a more orm like version of anchor that has like primary key ids and stuff. So, like, it's a lot more flexible when you can build on rust, and rust itself with macros is effing magic, and you can basically do whatever you want with it. So, yeah, I don't really, like, I don't really see, you know, move being a differentiator for these blockchains. If anything, I can see it actually being a detriment in terms of onboarding new devs because. I'm sorry, like, people who are familiar with move and familiar with blockchains and love languages are like, cool.
00:56:58.878 - 00:57:10.826, Speaker C: Like, I want to learn it and I love languages and I love learning, but when I was in finance, I wasn't going to go learn some esoteric blockchain language. If I was going to pick up a new language, I'd be like, oh, I'm going to go learn a new functional language.
00:57:10.930 - 00:57:42.734, Speaker B: So currently there's Iot network. Obviously, they're rolling out the 5G network at the moment. Am I right in thinking that there'll be like a VPN network and maybe other networks that could be built on helium? And also at the same time, I know the Hivemapper are building and leveraging helium, so I'm just wondering what this future is going to look like where maybe you guys are building networks on helium, but then other people are utilizing the wireless networks that you're providing to also do their own deep in projects. It's interesting to get your view.
00:57:43.034 - 00:58:44.704, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think there's going to be a lot of integrations like Hivemapper. So for Hivemapper people that don't know, it's basically a thing where you put a dash cam on your car and you can actually go and map the world with it, kind of like a Google Street View for them. One of their problems is like, okay, I need to actually verify that you're in the location that you say that you're in, which is the thing has a gps chip in it, I think, and it can track that. But one thing that's much harder to lie about is which helium IoT hotspots are you within range of? And if you hit a bunch of them, it can tell you exactly where you are? Well, not exactly, but it can prove pretty closely that you're not just trying to game the system by, you know, driving a thing around a circle somewhere else. And claiming to be providing value, which is like, this is a constant problem with Deepin is like people are just constantly trying to figure out. I mean, even like Stepn has this problem where like people were running around with like scooters with like 17 phones on them, like trying to game the system. And even helium has problems with people gaming it.
00:58:44.704 - 00:59:11.056, Speaker C: So I think we'll see a bunch of integrations like that. Using helium for location verification. We see things like using helium for areas that don't have very much Internet coverage because IoT signal has a much larger range. And then sub networks. Yeah, I think we're going to see a ton more sub networks. I think right now we're in the proving stage where now we have two. Going from one to two is a lot harder than going from two to three.
00:59:11.056 - 00:59:53.840, Speaker C: So once mobile proves out, I'm sure we will see more. I've definitely heard people in the community talking about VPN, I've heard people talking about Wifi, I've heard people talking about all sorts of things. To me it's just kind of a race of whether or not someone else is able to do that more successfully first. Like, Render's coming to Solana unless render decides to join helium as a subdal, which I would fucking love, but I don't think they're going to do it. Then is there a reason for us to go then launch a GPU based subdao? And the answer is probably not if the render is already doing a good job of it.
00:59:54.032 - 01:00:11.162, Speaker A: Can you actually elaborate a bit on this structure you're alluding to here with regards to the dao and the subdao, is the benefit for these subdao products, let's call them using the same token and inheriting some of the infra that helium already successfully used. Like, how does that all work?
01:00:11.338 - 01:00:55.754, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the idea. And generally I say we launch a subdal, but really be careful with using we because we don't. The community actually votes and decides to launch these things, and literally anybody can launch one. So as to why you would want to do it with dial approval, you have to get approved obviously to be a sub dial. But yeah, why you'd want to do it is because you don't have to go and build all this stuff, right? You already have this mint burn equilibrium, you already have this idea of a data credit. You have the entire might of the helium community backing you, which helps because these subdals, when they start out, they're almost subsidized by the helium network. And so they get incubated.
01:00:55.754 - 01:01:48.520, Speaker C: So it makes a lot of sense. And then you basically get everything working out of the box. The only thing you have to do is decide one. What are my rewardable entities going to be? Is it hotspots? Are there mappers? What are all of my different types of characters that can get rewarded? I need to issue those as nfts and then I need to go and write some code to make an oracle that decides how much each one of these players gets in mining rewards each day, which is relatively simple. If you wanted to go launch a network right now, that is the least of your problems. Trying to decide what each person gets rewards, it makes it a lot easier to just not think about things. That being said, we're also very interested in opening up all the tools that are generic.
01:01:48.520 - 01:02:00.754, Speaker C: They're already open source, so you can use them. But right now it's no documentation. We want to spin these things off so that you can also go and pull parts of helium without necessarily pulling all of it.
01:02:00.874 - 01:02:37.006, Speaker A: It reminds me, this is a bit of a crude analogy. It's not one to one, but the mobile virtual network operators you see like Mint Mobile, where they borrow some of T Mobile's network and then reset wholesale rates, then repackage it as mint mobile and sell that to customers with maybe a different business model or different products, or just get Ryan Reynolds face on there and just do a bunch of commercials. So instead of bootstrapping your own wireless provider, you can maybe take advantage of some opportunities as you see fit and benefit as well from this existing infra.
01:02:37.190 - 01:03:23.148, Speaker C: Yeah, and even like helium Mobile has this concept. Like, Nova Labs is the first carrier, but there can be multiple carriers, it's flexible. So Nova Labs might not end up being the only mobile carrier. There might be other ones that have different offerings and they kind of each have their own cutout of rewards and incentives. They can decide how they reward things differently. But yeah, helium mobile is interesting too, because people that are using the network can also get rewarded if they help map the network out, which again, goes to show the flexibility of this system. We're going from a world where the only thing that's rewardable is a hotspot, to a world where generically, anything can be rewardable.
01:03:23.148 - 01:03:51.288, Speaker C: And we track any kind of ownership on chain. And so it doesn't just have to be a miner, it can be somebody that's participating in the network in another way and providing value. And so, like even carriers themselves, like Nova labs as an entity, as a carrier, is providing a service and so the carrier itself is a rewardable entity. The subscribers on mobile are a rewardable entity. The miners on mobile are rewardable entity. So it's really, really cool. Like you can build all sorts of networks using this framework.
01:03:51.456 - 01:04:31.478, Speaker A: So, Noah, we obviously covered a lot in this interview in what I think is one of the most important and perhaps not talked about enough sectors in crypto in terms of decentralized physical infrastructure. I guess my final close out question here is paint us a picture of this long term vision for helium. It's like right now, today, Amazon, your Google's of the world, they own the cloud. Verizon's at and T's and Comcast are kind of like who we have to access the Internet through. But where does helium fit into this longer term vision? And this, I guess, in the words of Ryan Selkus, this war against censorship which will be fought in the cloud. How do you see this all playing out?
01:04:31.606 - 01:05:25.200, Speaker C: I just don't think that fundamentally any other wireless network is going to be able to grow and provide coverage as well as healing, especially in underdeveloped areas. The ability for someone to just go and buy one of these things and put it up in their house is so much more powerful for providing coverage. I think long term helium is going to be the best choice for wireless networks. I hope to see everything else follow similar deep end models. I would love to see ISP's somehow get decentralized. It's really cool to see things like render where we're decentralizing access to compute, but yeah, and long term for helium, we've got a lot more plans around trying to decentralize things further. This move to Solana, we had to move to oracles to scale, and we want to decentralize those oracles more and more.
01:05:25.200 - 01:05:42.120, Speaker C: There's a lot of interesting technical problems coming, and especially with more company joining us on Solana, it's going to be really cool to see what kind of deep end ecosystem blooms here. I think it'll be kind of similar to what we saw with NFTs, where a whole bunch of new tooling comes out.
01:05:42.232 - 01:05:50.304, Speaker A: Super exciting. We can't wait to see what else helium has in store for us all. Noah, thank you so much for taking the time to join us today.
01:05:50.464 - 01:05:51.184, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
