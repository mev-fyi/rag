00:00:14.120 - 00:00:39.508, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayer, the show where we explore next gen blockchains. I'm your host, Sol, alongside my co host Dave. And today we are joined by Hardhat Chad. Hardhat Chad is a pseudo anonymous creator of the or project. This project got a lot of attention, especially in March April when Solana was hitting a lot of congestion issues. Many were pointing the finger at ore. And for those who are not familiar, ore is a fair launch.
00:00:39.508 - 00:00:55.334, Speaker A: Proof of work. Cross border digital currency anyone can mine. There's a lot of interesting things we can discuss with respect to this project. One of the most unique ones I've seen on Solana and really excited to get into it. How's it going, Mister Chad?
00:00:55.502 - 00:00:57.934, Speaker B: Good. Great to be here. Thanks for having me on.
00:00:58.102 - 00:01:33.590, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, I think one of the key points behind, or is the similarities to bitcoin, the homage to proof of work, which I always loved. Proof of work over proof of stake. For a lot of reasons, it doesn't create these huge winners that just acquire a lot of stake without actually having anything to do with securing the network. You often find that exchanges just end up being the biggest validators. For instance, on POS networks versus proof of work, it's a physics problem. You have to invest in infrastructure, you have to keep up with the latest trends in mining.
00:01:33.590 - 00:01:41.030, Speaker A: Why did you feel like you wanted to bring that over to a modern blockchain like Solana?
00:01:41.570 - 00:03:29.978, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a few pieces to it, I guess at some level, going back to maybe the block size wars on bitcoin, you had two opposing sides. On one side, you had the big blockers, which was most of the network. Frankly, a lot of the miners Coinbase, a lot of the entrepreneurs on bitcoin at the time made these arguments that they wanted to increase the block size on bitcoin in order to scale the network and support lower fees and more transactions. And then on the other side of the argument, you had the small blockers, who were primarily the bitcoin core developers and some related parties, and their argument just that the natural state of bitcoin is for super expensive fees, for the block space to be saturated, and for most bitcoins to not move and take on this, I don't know, like gold esque sort of static asset characteristic. And then the other part of that argument was that it also helps decentralize the network, because if the block sizes get too big, then regular people can't run nodes, and the network kind of gets pushed into data centers like AWS and becomes more centralized that way. And I think ultimately like my opinion is both sides have their merits. Like the big blockers are right in that these chains need to scale, they need to support a lot of transactions and at very low fees, that people are going to use them.
00:03:29.978 - 00:04:10.468, Speaker B: Otherwise they're just not competitive to banking rails or wires or achille. And that's right. I find Solana is particularly attractive. It is competitive to banking grills at a very fundamental sense. It runs 24/7 you can send any amounts, like any dollar transaction settles in a second and costs a fraction of a cent. And that's really competitive. And at the same time, the merits to the small blocker arguments, in my opinion, is that people do want to feel some tangible connection to these networks.
00:04:10.468 - 00:05:03.948, Speaker B: People want to run nodes. And this proof of work on proof of stake concept gets you the best of both worlds. You can have the underlying consensus layer run on a proof of stake algorithm, and it runs on these very overpowered nodes and edge data centers, and it's very fast. But you can build a currency on top of that with proof of work and support an algorithm where people can run mining nodes out of their homes if they so want to, and that way people feel the tangible connections to the network. You get this democratized token issuance that anyone can participate in. But at the end of the day, it's also highly scalable payments chain.
00:05:04.124 - 00:05:29.010, Speaker A: I see. So this project is a fair launch. No insider allocation, no pre mine. A lot of, again, analogs to bitcoin. Is your vision for, or to be kind of. Because bitcoin is digital gold, how do you see people using, or is it more of, to your point, like an actual payments currency that leverages Solana for the speed? Or how would people use this?
00:05:30.270 - 00:06:40.120, Speaker B: Yeah, part of the intent was to try to return a little bit to the original bitcoin vision of this peer to peer electronic cash. I think that was what attracted a lot of optimism and inspiration in the early days of bitcoin. And I think more recently, since the small blockers won the block size wars and bitcoin has taken on this gold narrative, adoption on bitcoin is actually lower than it was in 2018, just in terms of businesses that accept payments in bitcoin. And I think that's kind of unfortunate. If you compare a bitcoin adoption chart to, like, a YouTube or a Netflix or a Facebook, or like any other kind of tech product, bitcoin adoption is actually pretty bad. Frankly, all metrics are bad other than price, the main thing. But price is important, so you can't ignore it completely.
00:06:40.120 - 00:07:10.950, Speaker B: But I do think we lost sight of this larger vision of just getting people to use the chain and use the tokens as this alternative form of money. I wanted to try to get crypto back on that track, basically of offering the world a peer to peer digital cash that we could use for payments.
00:07:12.530 - 00:08:05.490, Speaker C: I think it's an amazing experiment, and I love what you're saying about you're removing consensus from a POW coin, which I think is the first time that's ever happened. And I think that's a really interesting insight. I think probably the counter is when you have POW, bitcoin, and obviously ethereum, when it was PoW, there was an intrinsic value to those assets, outside of the fact it's just being created as a POW coin. And to some people that has an intrinsic value, but it was also being used for transactions on the network, and it just became the canonical asset on those networks, and obviously or doesn't benefit from those things. So yeah, it's interesting. And why do you think something like a sol or an ETH couldn't become that decentralized, more scalable medium of exchange?
00:08:07.110 - 00:09:20.076, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, proof of work is interesting for a few different reasons. Yeah, I mean, going to bitcoin, proof of work on bitcoin, it supports two different responsibilities. You first have proof of work, provides consensus for the chain, and then the second thing it supports is token distribution. And when we set out with this idea of we could rewrite bitcoin as a smart contract and launch that on Solana, as we were writing it, we realized that, well, actually Solana is providing consensus, and so we don't need to worry about that. And that actually opens up a lot of flexibility in terms of what we're able to, to focusing only on the token distribution side of things. And yeah, I think proof of work is really interesting just purely on a token distribution standpoint. Even without any sort of consensus or security properties, or we don't actually need to add those, mining and proof of work still makes sense.
00:09:20.076 - 00:10:49.890, Speaker B: Even if it's only for token distribution, people still understand it. You can press a button on a computer, you can do some computation, your computer gets hot, your fan spins, and you earn a token. Doing that kind of basic interaction, I think everyone intuitively understands. And I guess where I see that playing a role is know crypto at some level is sort of an alternative to like central banking, really, where we have this money supply, and it's like, how is the money going to be issued? And the fiat currency, it's basically a board of bankers that decide when we're going to mint new money and how much we're going to mint. And one of the things that I think was so revolutionary about bitcoin is basically saying, well, we can replace all of that with some open source code that anyone can read and we can audit it and everyone understands how it works and it's going to function by these known rules. And anyone can participate. I think we have a chance to reimplement that basic vision like proof of work for token distribution, where everyone can participate.
00:10:49.890 - 00:11:10.670, Speaker B: It can work on any laptop or phone, and you get a much more fair, I don't know, currency distribution than say, the systems that work by a central bank or even bitcoin mining in that case, which is highly inaccessible to most people.
00:11:12.740 - 00:11:25.440, Speaker C: Yeah, and something like Sol presumably as well, where you haven't got that fair, it's not as fair a distribution. And as we say with proof of stake, it tends to be that the whales just keep on getting sort of richer and richer.
00:11:26.220 - 00:12:20.122, Speaker B: Yeah. And the other thing that proof of work is kind of interesting, that makes it interesting is it ties tokenization production to the physical world through like energy. And that every new token that gets put into circulation has a real physical energy cost to it. And that kind of creates a real economic opportunity cost to producing tokens, because that energy could be used for, I mean, anything really. Energy is like the most universal fundamental resource that we know of. Everything requires energy. So like, for there to be a real tangible, like, economic opportunity cost to producing new tokens.
00:12:20.122 - 00:12:36.220, Speaker B: It doesn't set a floor price per se, but it signals how much people are willing to give up to acquire one of those tokens, which makes it kind of interesting just from a cost of production analysis standpoint.
00:12:36.680 - 00:13:16.250, Speaker A: So I think it's a very powerful vision and it's a simple one where if you want to onboard hundreds of millions or billions of people, give them an easy path to acquired coins, to acquire tokens, whether through mining or what have you. I think this experiment actually also played out pretty well with the telegram and Tan where you had these essential, essentially click farming type of apps or things like hamster combat, katazen, notcoin. Pretty simple. It got people on board. These things now do millions of daus. I think at some point it flipped Ethereum and daily active atrices taunted. But help me understand this.
00:13:16.250 - 00:13:51.010, Speaker A: I think one of the interesting things about bitcoin story was if you were early enough, yeah. You could get away with mining it on a personal computer. Maybe you were able to co opt your school's computer lab into rigging a bunch of miners and acquiring some bitcoin that way. Over time, though, the game got a lot harder. A lot more competition came in. Everyone's optimizing their rigs and essentially crowding out the little person. How did you architect or to prevent this, or do you think this will still happen as more people get on board?
00:13:53.270 - 00:14:54.244, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the really hard technical problem that we're taking on, because it's not easy. It's easy to sit on here and say, okay, we created something that everyone can mine. Doing that at a technical level is a very challenging problem, actually. And we have a thesis, like, we'll see how it plays out. It's hard to make predictions about the future, but basically a lot of this comes down to the hash function that is used. And in the v one, we use the hash function called tra three, which is kind of a successor to which is what is used in bitcoin mining. This hash function is very easy to optimize in hardware.
00:14:54.244 - 00:15:57.886, Speaker B: So a GPU will get like, I don't know, three orders of magnitude more performance per watt than a CPU at doing SHA 256 and sha three hashing. And then ASIC, or like FPGA ward can basically do another couple orders of magnitude on top of that. And so with our supply function over trying to issue one or per minute, the orders of magnitude difference between your top end compute and your low end compute are so large that we actually just like, eventually run out of decimals to give everyone a reward. That was the fundamental problem of the v one, where I, after recognizing that, to realize, okay, we need to pause this and focus on v two and fix it in v two. There were other issues as well. But the hash function was the fundamental one that required an upgrade. For the v two, we have a different hash function.
00:15:57.886 - 00:17:26.623, Speaker B: We spent a long time kind of researching how to actually solve this problem. And what we settled on was we found a hash function called equix, which was originally designed for the Tor onion browser network and recently rolled out, I think, over the last, like, two years or so. And it's basically the client puzzle that Tor uses to disincentivize spam on the network, which is where proof of work actually comes from. It's more of a spam prevention mechanism than like a crypto thing, but we, like, stole it from the, and started using it for other purposes in crypto to do mining. And the history behind this hash function basically is written by a developer named Tevedor, who originally wrote random x for Monero and random x was the ASIC resistant hash function for Monero. Chain and Tor hired him to build this client puzzle, and he kind of took some sub processes from randomx and combined them with another hash function called equihash, which is used in zcash as well. And it's the basic resistant hash function, zcash.
00:17:26.623 - 00:18:52.614, Speaker B: And they kind of combine these two things and then call the new hash function equiax. And there are currently no asics today that I'm aware of. Purpose built to solve equix puzzles. But as a point of reference, there are some asics today on the market for the zcash variants of equihash, and they basically are two orders of magnitude, like 100 times more performant per watt than a cpu, which is actually really good in terms of ASIC resistance as far as asic resistance goes, because like 100 order magnitude difference per watt is actually not that crazy. And in the v two, we're adding eleven decimals to the token. So our thesis is that even if one day asics do come into the picture for this equiax hash that we're using, there'll be somewhere between like ten and 100 x more performance per watch than a cpu. But because we have eleven decimals on the token, we should still have space to make sure that everyone earns some reward at the end of the day with many orders of magnitude buffer to spare, is the thesis.
00:18:52.614 - 00:19:08.670, Speaker B: But things change. So we'll see how this plays out really over the next probably five to ten years. But that's kind of our bet going forward that we're trying to build around.
00:19:09.570 - 00:19:35.090, Speaker A: So, to summarize real quickly, is the optimization problem you're making here is you want the spread between, I guess, the lowest tier miner and the highest tier miner to be. It's going to be inevitable that there will be a gap, but you want it to be as kind of small as possible, like 100 x or so, versus a million x, so that everyone can kind of still get something out of each lockerboard. Okay, that's a good way to put it.
00:19:35.390 - 00:19:55.850, Speaker C: Should we go back actually, to your v one launch? It'd be good just to understand how that went, because from my perspective as an outsider, obviously Solana itself sort of ground to a halt, and there seemed to be a massive issue with spamming. So what was the approach that you were taking in v one, and what was the issues that led to you halting?
00:19:56.160 - 00:20:40.960, Speaker B: Yeah, the V one. The main insight there was we realized we actually didn't need to worry about consensus, because Solana was providing that, since that gave us a lot more flexibility to do more creative things that other proof of work tokens hadn't done before. And the main thing we were experimenting with there was we gave each miner their own cache chain. And so the thought was, as long as you find a hash of sufficient difficulty, you can append that to your chain, and you can land hashes, and I can land hashes. And as long as our hashes are valid, we can both earn rewards. That's how we get to this point where everyone can mine is our rewards are not exclusive. We can both earn at the same time.
00:20:40.960 - 00:21:43.390, Speaker B: That was the intent going in. And we realized, okay, we're giving everyone kind of a bot to submit transactions. And as long as the difficulty is low enough, people should find hashes relatively quickly, and then it's just about getting them to the chain. And so we had some inkling of an idea that maybe it would be a lot of traffic, but I didn't know exactly where in the stack it was going to cause issues. It just turned out there was, like, some. Some bugs in the networking layer that it really aggravated and made a lot worse, because the way it ended up playing out was there really were, like, two tiers of miners in the v. One just put it monthly.
00:21:43.390 - 00:23:05.390, Speaker B: There was one tier that was most people, which were using the open source clients that we had written and put out the experience. There was people would mine for a little bit, maybe 1020 seconds, so they would find a hash of sufficient difficulty. They would submit that, and the transaction would fail, and then they would try to submit again, and the transaction would fail, and they would try to submit again, and the transaction would fail. And those people were landing a hash maybe once every, I don't know, ten to 15 minutes or so. And then you had a second tier of miners who basically were just more technically sophisticated. And they realized that, like, the difficulty was so low that it was very easy to sible, let's say, even a regular laptop, you could mine in parallel across a bunch of key pairs. And the game, there comes much more about how many hashes could you fit in a single transaction, and then how many transactions could you fit in a jito bundle, and how high could you tip your bundles? And those people were landing probably, like, dozens of hashes every few seconds or so.
00:23:05.390 - 00:24:02.104, Speaker B: We had this very lopsided kind of outcome there because of the congestion on the chain. And just due to differences in technical sophistication, the game was not about hash power. At all really, it was just about, could you land transactions? So that was another kind of reason for leading to the pause. In addition to the hash function problems, it was like, okay, we also have this weird, lopsided mining situation that we want to resolve. That was the issue with v one. It was great marketing because obviously we paused the chain and forced everyone to talk about Orlando, but was not really the intent of the project. We wanted everyone to earn the token, and that wasn't really happening.
00:24:02.104 - 00:25:12.930, Speaker B: And so it's kind of, in terms of our overall mission, I think we had room for improvement. But to get to the v two, what we're changing, or we're changing some of the incentives such that the way that miners will maximize rewards is by landing the most difficult hash they can every minute. So basically, regardless of hash power, regardless of how much hash power you have, miners should maximize the rewards by basically mining for 55, like 56 seconds and then submitting the most difficult hash they've found in that time to the chain for verification. And then based on the number of leading zeros on that hash, the difficulty, you'll earn more or less rewards. And if you try to spam more frequently than that, you'll basically only increase your fee per hash. And so it just kind of eats away into your yield. And that's how we're trying to mitigate the spam problem in the v two.
00:25:13.340 - 00:25:47.140, Speaker C: Can you just provide slightly more color on that? Because in my mind, if it's 100 x difference between maybe the best performing piece of hardware and the worst performing piece of hardware, and you've tried to get that number as small as possible, surely at some point it's going to be better to just run loads and loads of small ones in the thousands and the millions. Whereas obviously, if the difference between the best and the worst was like a million, then it would make more sense that you would try and put all of your hash power into a single machine. So how are you? I don't know, is that a valid concern or how are you going about trying to mitigate it?
00:25:48.200 - 00:26:20.470, Speaker B: Yeah, if you are splitting your hash power across multiple key pairs and submitting, maybe the other thing to mention here too, is we're limiting the contract limits one hash per transaction. So for every hash you find, you have to submit a different transaction. Basically, if you're splitting your hash power across key pairs and you have to submit ten transactions instead of one.
00:26:22.330 - 00:26:22.682, Speaker A: You'Re.
00:26:22.706 - 00:27:04.814, Speaker B: Paying more base fees and more priority fees and more geo tips and everything else just to land those ten transactions, as opposed to landing that one. So an EV expected value standpoint, the or you might earn from those ten is probably the same as the one on average, but you have a lot more fees submitting ten transactions as opposed to submitting one transaction. So as much as you can, you're going to be incentivized to consolidate your hash power around a single key pair and just land the most difficult hash you possibly can every minute, I guess.
00:27:04.982 - 00:28:11.760, Speaker A: One thing I wanted to clarify, actually, is because you mentioned with V one, one of the issues was it became a game of spamming transactions on chain. And this is kind of a. It's a common problem with Solana just dating back to 2021, where, you know, people would want to mint something, they spam it, they want to buy a meme coin that that's, you know, hot, they start spamming it. Judo has become the Mev king of Solana, and now that's part of the meta. Now you kind of have to just, if you want to land really quickly, if you're running a really tight operation on the trading front, all these pro trading apps even have a field now where you have your bribe amount, you have your priority fee. It seems like we've moved somewhat far away from the original vision of Solana, which was, you know, fast, cheap for everyone. I mean, what's been kind of your response to this kind of ground shifting underneath, so to speak, of Solana? Do you think it gets solved over time, or is this an inevitability of any blockchain that wants to scale with usage?
00:28:12.860 - 00:29:24.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's difficult. Like, it's a difficult problem. You have a tragedy of the Commons problem, really, on any public computer network, particularly on a blockchain where there's a financial benefit to landing your transactions in a timely manner. Yeah, it's very, very difficult then, to, I think, just handle the spam that that inherently incentivizes, perhaps. So just thinking aloud here as we're talking, I mean, Tor is managing this right now as some proof of work. And, I mean, on Devnet, we have the similar issue on, like, all Devnet faucets across crypto, I think, like, in Solana in particular. But ethereum, if I'm recalling correctly, have a spam issue as well, where people spam the Devnet faucets and drain them.
00:29:24.824 - 00:30:17.620, Speaker B: And the way that that has kind of been managed is largely through a proof of work mechanism as well, where proof of work kind of functions as a spam disincentive. And maybe that's the way that this ends up getting resolved. Maybe there's some role that, or could play there. I'm not sure. I'm just thinking off the top of my head right now, but I think, yeah, clearly it seems there's not enough disincentive to spam. And so we do have a tragedy. The Commons problem, wherever I, I mean, even, like, good actors, good faith actors, like, they see a financial benefit to sending way more transactions than they need to increase the probability of inclusion.
00:30:17.620 - 00:30:40.780, Speaker B: Maybe if there's some alternative method to, you know, provide high odds of inclusion, then people won't see a need to spam. But right now, it's just kind of, there is some limited bandwidth there, and so if you can maximize your allocation of that bandwidth, you're probably going to increase your odds of inclusion.
00:30:41.920 - 00:31:01.900, Speaker A: Did you, by the way, mention how you decided to go with Solana as the underlying ecosystem to build on top of? I'm sure you've considered other options, too. A lot of people could even see this. Why not just make this in l two? That's the meme of the day. But how do you think about the choice of the ecosystem?
00:31:02.470 - 00:31:46.274, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Personally, I'm not a fan of Altoos is a short answer, like, we originally got to the idea of, or because I spent a long time thinking about bridging bitcoin to, like, to Solana in particular. It's like, how do we, how do we solve, like, we lost the block size force. Bitcoin can't scale. How do we, how do we make bitcoin scale? Okay, let's bridge it. I dived deep into the technicals of bridging, and I frankly just wasn't convinced that that was the solution. And so it just kind of started as a joke, was like, well, let's just rewrite it as a smart contract and launch that.
00:31:46.274 - 00:32:26.940, Speaker B: And that gets us, quote, unquote, bitcoin on Solana. And so, yeah, it just started as that joke, and then that sat on the shelf for, like, I don't know, seven, eight months before I had finally had the time to, like, work on it. And honestly, I thought it was going to flop. But we're here talking about it now, so I guess maybe there's something to the joke. But, yeah, in terms of why Solana. I've been working in the Solana space for around two and a half, three years now. And so I was just familiar with the technology.
00:32:26.940 - 00:33:41.040, Speaker B: And frankly, I was a crypto skeptic for a really long time, because I come from this payments and banking world where I used to do a lot of integrations with banks moving tens of billions of dollars a year and every currency imaginable. And we obviously knew about ethereum, but it was, why would we use this kind of thing? Because the fees were just so absurd and it could take 30 minutes to 2 hours to get a transaction to land. And so, just like that, wasn't competitive to Ach. Rails. Ach and wireless were way better for our use case anyway. But Solana, I first heard about it in February of 2021, and I understood the pitch at the time was basically, you could send a $10,000 transaction to anyone in the world, across borders, it'll settle in a second, and the fees are like a fraction of a cent, and it runs twenty four seven. And that was competitive to say ach and wires rails.
00:33:41.040 - 00:34:04.812, Speaker B: And that was what really caught my eye and pulled me into crypto. And so Solana has just kind of been where I've been working since in that ecosystem. I guess when we had this thought to try a new proof of work, token salon was just the natural choice. I didn't really even consider any other.
00:34:04.996 - 00:34:51.280, Speaker C: Chain, because there is a feeling that Ethereum is this institutional chain. Now, you've obviously got the biddle fund from Blackrock, and everyone seems to think that everyone's just going to settle everything on ethair one, but no one seems to have any thoughts about how it's actually going to be traded and sent around, because surely that can't happen on the ether one. So it leads me to think that this is not its final destination. It's either going to go to an l two, probably a centralized l two, but then that gets very tricky, because not all of the major players are going to want to buy in. So it all just gets very, very tricky. And, yeah, there's this feeling that maybe Solana isn't going to have any of that pie, and I just don't buy it. I just think it's like, by far the most obvious choice, but you sort of have to look ahead and where the puck is going.
00:34:52.340 - 00:35:41.760, Speaker B: Yeah, my hot take, honestly, which might get me into trouble for saying this, but, I mean, I think most l two s today are basically just unlicensed money transmitters. Like, they have all the properties of, like, a venmo, let's say. It's kind of like, you know, they can reverse transactions, they can pause transactions anytime. It's just a database holding people's balances that is running in a centralized computer somewhere in AWS, but they just haven't applied for the mtls it's. I think if the regulators understood that at a deeper level, some of these lts would be in more trouble than they are. But yeah, I think ultimately you need to decentralize. Otherwise you're just an unlicensed money transmit.
00:35:42.800 - 00:36:19.100, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Just going back to. Or I was wondering about the supply because obviously one of the main selling points about bitcoin is 21 million total max cap supply. You keep mentioning, I think on v one that it was maybe the same rewards per hash that went through v two. There'll be, I think, a difference between rewards depending on how big or how powerful the hash was that you submitted. Sorry if that terminology is wrong. So is this going on forever? Are you going to be doing a harvening? Are you capped at 21 million?
00:36:19.440 - 00:37:03.006, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. I guess I can just make this announcement now. You're going to force me to send out a tweet this weekend. But yeah, we are going to cap the v two supply. We're going to keep the same one or per minute supply function. We think that it's a very simple, reliable, dependable thing and it's easy to understand, but we are going to cap the limit at 21 million tokens at a steady one or per minute rate. That will give us 40 years of mining until the total or supply is mined up.
00:37:03.006 - 00:37:15.270, Speaker B: And then, yeah, after that it'll be a fixed supply token. So we're basically looking at like 2064 when all 21 million were mined.
00:37:15.390 - 00:37:20.650, Speaker C: And why were you not thinking about doing a halvening and reducing the supply as we go ahead?
00:37:21.510 - 00:38:34.920, Speaker B: Yeah, my belief here is that there's already so much advantage to being early. If you start doing avenings, you basically over prioritize those early adopters to an extent that it hurts long term adoption. And so one of my frustrations, I guess, with bitcoin today is that we're in a situation where over 90% of the overall bitcoin supply has been mined, yet less than 5% of the world population are holders. And of that supply, I think it's something like 70, 80% of it is held by 1% of wallets or something. Partially because over half the supply, the bitcoin supply, was mined in those first five years. And even five years after launch, bitcoin is growing. But most people hadn't heard of it at that point yet.
00:38:34.920 - 00:39:57.906, Speaker B: You're just starting from this very lopsided distribution, which forces us into the situation where today we're like our primary call to action. When we onboard people to crypto is we basically tell them, buy my coin, buy bitcoin, buy ethereum, buy soul, buy this meme coin, buy whatever. And yeah, I sort of see it as, like, I see that as problematic because there's just a limit to how many people were going on board when our whole onboarding call to action is invest in my stuff. Our thesis was like, well, we have this alternative method of onboarding people to crypto called mining, which is this token distribution method that's been here since day one. And if we could build a consumer experience around that, that might be the way that we just get tokens of the hands of tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people. And so I think it's important that we keep that opportunity open for as long as we reasonably can. And that's why we want to go through that linear one or per minute rate.
00:39:57.906 - 00:40:38.120, Speaker B: We'll hit the 50% mark 20 years in rather than five years in, and we'll hit the 90% mark. I think it's like 38 years in or something like that. 37 years in as opposed to like eleven or 13 years in that bitcoin had. So it's like, it just gives us a lot more time. So people joining five years from now or ten years from now, they still have upside in the token and they can get a reasonable percentage of the supply and don't feel like they've already missed the boat because they were just born like five years too late or something.
00:40:39.060 - 00:41:00.310, Speaker A: One of the things you mentioned and the tweet thread you put out when you paused, v one was obviously what we talked about, which is revisiting the smart contracts, making some changes, and the other was building a team and scaling up the operational side of Orlando. Talk a bit about what that's looked like for you so far and where you guys are at.
00:41:01.050 - 00:41:34.862, Speaker B: Yeah, we're a team at two now. I don't want to dox the other individual just yet. We will both docs at some point for sure. But yeah, right now it's like Hardhat Chad and company working on. Working on the system. And yeah, we've been going through Coliseum the last. The Coliseum accelerated the last like five and a half weeks.
00:41:34.862 - 00:42:33.276, Speaker B: Now we're coming up on demo day and yeah, we have started a company. So there is a registered entity, regular collapse and the mission of the company is basically just to onboard 100 million people to crypto through mining. We view ore is the first product of a few that we plan to launch over the next few months or being the base currency proof of work token on Solana fair launch. We call it a cross quarter digital currency. It's a CBDC. That's great, but that's product one. And then we have a few kind of secret projects in the works that we'll announce probably around breakpoint.
00:42:33.468 - 00:42:45.370, Speaker A: How's that been, by the way? Because we had Matt from the Coliseum on the show a little while ago. Um, but is that an experience that you gained a lot of insight from? Would you recommend it to other potential founders?
00:42:45.710 - 00:43:54.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I would, definitely. Um, it's been invaluable, uh, just in terms of the, like, relationships and connections to other founders throughout the ecosystem. I think everyone in the cohort is, like, incredibly, uh, world class talent. And the mentors that they brought in, everyone from Arnold at Sphere, Vibhu, adrip, Mert, Stefan at squads and so many others, is like, getting one on one time with them and, you know, being able to ask them questions and just get the telegram handle to chat anytime has been super, super valuable for everything from fundraising to, like, product strategy and Twitter strategies. It's like, there's great people. And so, yeah, being able to get those relationships through Coliseum and get the advice of Maddie and Clay and Nate is been super awesome. We have been the guinea pigs, so we've, like.
00:43:54.404 - 00:44:02.230, Speaker B: I think the Colosseum guys have also, like, we're probably fat at the roughest, but, like, any coliseum group I will ever have.
00:44:04.690 - 00:44:19.950, Speaker C: How do you think about governance and things like that? Because obviously, it's something which bitcoin has struggled with. Are you in the camp of just sort of set this fee to hopefully that's the final iteration, and then just leave it, or would you want to introduce any form of governance, do you think?
00:44:20.530 - 00:45:02.902, Speaker B: Yeah, my experience with governance has also not been great. I think that was probably the third, like, nail in the coffin on the v one, was we just made the wrong thing governable. Like, difficulty should never have been a governable property. And I think that, yeah, that was like, a design mistake simply because I didn't know what to do with it. I didn't know what the right algorithm should have been for, like, changing difficulty. So we just made it an admin function to change the difficulty. And that, naturally invited the debate around.
00:45:02.902 - 00:46:09.480, Speaker B: Well, like, who has the authority to change the difficulty? Is it me unilaterally? Is the community based on a token vote? Is it a few tarkey based on some other system? And at the end of the day, the difficulty just never should have been governable to begin with. I think that that was kind of just not the right design. And so with V two, we're definitely trying to minimize the admin variables at this point. The implementation that's out there right now does have a few admin variables. There's like some tolerance thing, and there is a pause function. But I'm actually considering just removing all of those for the v two. And I think what might be simpler is if we remove all admin functions entirely, and then we might leave the contract mutable for, like, a few months just to manage the initial launch and then long term refreeze it.
00:46:09.480 - 00:47:20.570, Speaker B: I think if we refreeze that contract in many ways or will be more immutable than even bitcoin is, I think it's harder to change an immutable contract on Solana than it is to ship a commit to the bitcoin core code, depending on the commit, obviously. But a frozen contract on Solana is, you're not going to change that really ever. It's a big freeze in the contract is a really big long term commitment. We just want to make sure that we have, like, the overall design and mechanics right before we prematurely do that. And so I think no admin variables, but leaving it mutable for a few months and then freezing after we get through the launch period will kind of make sense. And if we need to, like, do some, if we need to interject and, like, fix anything, we have that window of opportunity to do it. So it's up to the team to steward it through that launch and then set it up and freeze it for long term success.
00:47:21.750 - 00:47:53.840, Speaker C: I think that makes sense. By sort of limiting its scope, it probably allows you the opportunity more readily than something like a bitcoin to step away and just leave the code immutable. So that sounds the right approach. One other thing I heard on the spaces that you did recently that was intriguing was you're going to be introducing some form of staking with the token that miners can use. And again, that seems like a really interesting, novel approach to POW coins because obviously staking has never really been a thing. So how did you arrive at that decision?
00:47:55.380 - 00:48:46.830, Speaker B: Yeah, that was the fourth nail in the coffin for the VW. Just keep adding nails. Was there was no inherent. Well, we came to the conclusion that miners who hold ore should receive some advantage in the system. They shouldn't be overpowered, but there should be some advantage. And it's all about trying to find the right balance there. And so the mechanism that we landed on is basically a staking mechanism, where if you leave your ore unclaimed like just leave it in the contract or you buy ore off the markets and you can stake it in the contract.
00:48:46.830 - 00:49:28.976, Speaker B: Depending on how much you have staked, you will basically earn a two x multiplier or up to a two x multiplier on your mining rewards. And so that was meant to create just some like structural incentive to kind of like one or ore begets ore. If you have some ore and you're mining, you'll receive more ore. And if you're not staking, you'll kind of fall behind to those who are staking in some ways. And you'll still earn even if you're not staking. And the multiplier only applies if you're actively mining. So it's not really a passive yield situation.
00:49:28.976 - 00:49:53.880, Speaker B: Like you need to have real hash power and be actively submitting hashes for that multiplier to apply. But it is meant to create a structural incentive to hold the token and just give an advantage to those miners who value the ore and hold onto it and signal that they're not just market selling.
00:49:54.870 - 00:50:49.840, Speaker A: Kind of like the last series of questions I wanted to touch on is, can you walk me through what the future looks like in terms of consumerizing, mining and onboarding people into crypto this way and concretely, like, could someone mine ore on their mobile while doing other things with it? Would it have to be something they do when they're not using the phone? How are you thinking about this? Because I think, again, bringing up ton and whether you want to call it real mining or not, it's not really mining, it's just people are clicking stuff and maybe a background process is running and people acquire hot tokens or whatever, but that clearly worked. How are you thinking about if you want to get 100 million users, a lot of them will be on mobile, a lot of them will be in emerging markets. What does that consumer experience look like for them?
00:50:51.360 - 00:51:30.530, Speaker B: Yeah, mobile is really key. It's absolutely key to reaching the masses. I mean, everything consumer happens on mobile. And so that's pretty fundamental. We won't have a mobile app ready like on the day of the v two launch, but it is in the works. And so, yeah, we're still working out to the exact rollout strategy there. I think we'll probably start with Solana Saga, an Android app there.
00:51:30.530 - 00:52:20.496, Speaker B: It's just easiest to get into the Dapp store for us anyway. Easier than the play store, like the iOS app store. But yeah, I mean, mobile is absolutely key to reaching, reaching consumers and then the other kind of channel there is, I think it will. I don't want to reveal too many. We have some projects we're working on, but I say we do want to. The whole goal is lower those barriers of entry as much as we can. Anything that just makes it easier for people to mine, like, gives people more hash power are things that we're considering.
00:52:20.496 - 00:52:28.660, Speaker B: And some, we are actively moving on and we'll have a few surprise announcements over the next few months about that.
00:52:30.200 - 00:52:43.100, Speaker A: And real quickly, does the process of mining on a mobile device incapacitate it as far as processing? What exactly is the, is happening at a technical level?
00:52:44.360 - 00:53:02.020, Speaker B: Well, yeah, it'll consume your battery for sure. Okay. Which is the opportunity cost going back to like the energy cost of producing tokens. Yeah. Like if someone's willing to give up their phone battery to acquire this token, it's a signal of, of like how much they value the token.
00:53:03.120 - 00:53:03.940, Speaker A: Yep.
00:53:04.640 - 00:53:07.032, Speaker C: Stop anyone from touching grass now, just.
00:53:07.056 - 00:53:20.580, Speaker A: Like, actually this is kind of brilliant because it'll get people off of TikTok and they'll just want to mine this instead. So this could actually solve a lot of societal problems all in one. Banking recommender systems.
00:53:21.320 - 00:53:25.384, Speaker B: I also have like a saga that's sitting around collecting dust and so you want to.
00:53:25.512 - 00:53:28.340, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it's a good point. It's doing literally nothing.
00:53:28.770 - 00:54:43.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I could get that mining or it'd be useful and yeah, it's basically doing computation on your phone. So there will be a toggle to sort of manage how many compute cores you're using. So if your phone has say eight cores, you could say use two of them and leave the other six for the rest of your phone and the rest of your applications. But if you want to max out and sort of make your phone real clunky and probably burn the battery, you could max it out and just grind on all cores. And so, yeah, I mean, we just kind of want to leave it to the user for them to make the decision as to how much of their computing device, like, I think the user should be able to say whether anywhere from zero to 100%, we just have to make those options available.
00:54:47.100 - 00:55:12.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want to say that I think that in this market at the moment, I think we're in dire need of a new meta. People say that often the next meta tends to be like a new way for tokens to be distributed to people. Often the new metas tend to be repetition of an old meta that never really quite got going. Or I'd say in this case it's just been like most people in crypto have. Never mind. I've never mind. Because you were just priced out.
00:55:12.880 - 00:55:47.868, Speaker C: So it really feels like a really ripe, unique opportunity. This could really drive things forward because it is brand new. We've never had it on top of fast blockchains before. It does bring people in and also basically it's deep in, but deep in on steroids because you're not waiting for at and t to buy into the fact that this network is good enough for them to start using. And it's a 510 year infrastructure project. The utility here initially is going to be. People are buying it because they think the price will go higher.
00:55:47.868 - 00:55:59.796, Speaker C: And that's the best utility there is in crypto. So I'm super excited and I think it's got a real shot to drive both Solana and the entire crypto ecosystem forward next few months.
00:55:59.988 - 00:56:00.268, Speaker B: So.
00:56:00.284 - 00:56:01.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want to say that.
00:56:02.580 - 00:56:50.890, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I agree. I think we see the same thing. And I've talked to a number of folks in the crypto space over the last few weeks. Yeah, we have secret projects we're working on, but suffice to say, I sort of take this vision of light a thousand Satoshi's bloom sort of thing where we want to make these tools more accessible. I think it would be unfortunate to or is the only proof of work token. We saw a number of forks of or especially after the pause and a lot of the discussion around those forks was happening in the OR.
00:56:50.890 - 00:57:17.280, Speaker B: Discord is like we kind of attracted this base of folks who like, are really interested in mining and obviously there's a lot of attention around ore, but it's like, it's proof of work. Can work for other tokens too. And I think it is a really unique mechanism of speculating and distributing tokens. And we have a lot of ideas on that front that we're looking forward to sharing over the next few weeks.
00:57:18.580 - 00:57:40.434, Speaker A: Super cool. It's like metadatao and a subdao as you have or. And sub ors. Yeah, that's a good note to close on, though. We're basically echoing what Dave said. Super excited for what's to come. I think this does have a shot at bringing on hundreds of millions of people through mining.
00:57:40.434 - 00:57:48.346, Speaker A: Best of luck with the remainder of Coliseum demo day, pushing out v two and all the other secret projects that we're excited to learn about in the coming months.
00:57:48.498 - 00:57:51.130, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for having me on. It was a lot of fun.
