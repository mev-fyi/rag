00:00:14.240 - 00:00:51.410, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we explore next generation blockchains. I'm your host Saul, alongside my co host here, Dave. And today we're doing a part two of sorts on Metadao since we last spoke with the creator of Metadao Prophet, who's with us today. And alongside on the metadata side, we have metanolic. Much has happened in the market as well as just adoption and interest in Metadao. Lots of new proposals, and many are already calling it the most exciting experiment in all of crypto. I think we actually called it that when we first interviewed profit, but that has now become consensus, I think, in a lot of ways.
00:00:51.410 - 00:00:55.494, Speaker A: And so profit and men and Alec, thank you so much for joining us today.
00:00:55.964 - 00:00:57.304, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:00:57.644 - 00:00:58.692, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks.
00:00:58.868 - 00:01:07.944, Speaker A: So I think the best way to start this episode is let's catch the listener up on what's happened with Metadao since we last spoke.
00:01:08.364 - 00:02:11.152, Speaker B: Yeah, well, when we last spoke, I guess we were, I think a few proposals, like maybe one or two proposals had happened and we were starting to see Utarkey play out, but it hadnt really been tested. It was only maybe a few, like 50 people per proposal and definitely not big dollar wise. The volume in each markets was not super high. Now weve had 15 proposals on various things weve come up. We've aligned on a given strategy, which is building feature key as a service. So we want to expand this to other daos. And then, yeah, we had some pretty interesting proposals that I'm sure we'll get into both interesting in content, but probably more excitingly interestingly in how the proposals played out.
00:02:11.328 - 00:02:55.376, Speaker A: And I think this is one of the most interesting things that I saw recently about metadata. Maybe we can start with this topic, which is futarchies of service. So when we first were last chatted about all this, the concepts of a futarchy, which you mentioned was something brought up by Robin Hansen, like the early two thousands was more of just this idea. And crypto allowed us in a way to try it out and experiment with it. And we've seen some interesting results from it that, especially you guys with the early iterations of metadata, what gave you the confidence that this is something that, yes, it works to an extent. We should try to have other Daos use it. Let's productize that.
00:02:55.376 - 00:03:00.324, Speaker A: How did you guys arrive at that conclusion? How did you see the demand for this come up?
00:03:03.064 - 00:04:08.354, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I think it was seeing the, after we run some proposals, I guess with every proposal, your conviction grows. The first proposal, it was kind of like a science experiment. And now once you have high volume markets, it starts to become real. Once people are making real and losing real money in the futurchic markets, it starts to become real. And then, yeah, we had interest from other Daos in the Solano ecosystem, like, some of the prominent ones, where theyre like, hey, we might want to do this because our governance kind of sucks today. And so, yeah, and so we were like, okay, we were working on this other thing at the time and were still kind of working on that, which is this vote market for Sabre, where people will trade their governance votes for money. But to have, like, kind of customers banging down the door, wanting it, wanting to use futurkey, we're like, okay, we got to do this now.
00:04:08.354 - 00:04:11.594, Speaker B: And so, yeah, that's pretty much what we're focused on full time.
00:04:12.934 - 00:04:26.554, Speaker A: And real quickly, let's just walk through a quick example of maybe one of those proposals or maybe perhaps even one that resonated with a lot of people, just so we can kind of concretely define what you're, what we're talking about here.
00:04:28.364 - 00:04:57.674, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So a cool one was Ben Hawkins, who worked for the Solana foundation. But here he was acting just like as an independent person. He created a proposal to buy $50,000 worth of meta, which is the native token of metadata. And his proposal was buying it below. It would be buying it below spot price.
00:04:57.674 - 00:06:21.776, Speaker B: So I think at the time, the spot price was like $60, and he was going to buy it for $30 per meta if the proposal passed. And so he wanted this proposal to pass because, like, who doesn't want free money, right? Like, who doesn't want to be able to buy stuff for below spot? And so he spent $250,000 trying to manipulate the markets his favor. And so specifically, he took that money, or a decent amount of it, and bought in the past market. So essentially, he was trying to make the market reflect that metadata would be more valuable if the proposal passed. So he placed huge bids in the past market. And the problem that he ran into was that every time he placed these very high bids, so essentially he was placing a bid thats like, okay, metadata will be worth two x the current valuation. If the proposal passes, someone else would trade against that because they were like, okay, wait, if the proposal passes, its probably not going to two x in value, but if I can sell to him for two x the value and then buy back later, then I can either take the money home or two x my holdings.
00:06:21.776 - 00:07:14.344, Speaker B: And so they would sell into his bids and then the prices basically reflected the idea that, no, the Dow would not be more valuable if the proposal passed. And so it didn't pass. And I think that's kind of like, it shows that, well, when I first talk about futarchy with some people, they'll say like, oh, this is just voting with money. This is essentially like voting by rich people. But it goes to show that markets have these natural incentives baked in that prevent manipulation and are like, you're incentivized to find the correct price. And so, yeah, that was pretty cool because it really showed in practice that utarchy is manipulation resistant.
00:07:15.794 - 00:07:28.334, Speaker A: Metanolik is with us. I don't think you weren't with us last time, obviously. Tell us about how you got involved with Medidao, what your focus area is and what you guys have been jamming on these days.
00:07:29.074 - 00:08:37.384, Speaker C: Yeah. So I went to breakpoint in Amsterdam and was invited to a crypto aligned dinner with, which was a small group of people, which was cool. I appreciated that. I was going to get invited to that and sat across from this guy that was talking about short term futures as a currency and how we didn't need currency anymore. And I was intrigued certainly by that, and went, walked with him over to the Jito rap party, or it was an invite party, and we were talking about what he was working on and pitched metadow. So I was really intrigued from the, from the get go. And we stayed in touch, hung out a few times in at breakpoint, and then came home and the airdrop was announced and then the UI was announced for the, one of the first proposals.
00:08:37.384 - 00:09:06.164, Speaker C: And so I took my airdrop and said, if this is going to work, this will be cool. Let's get some volume on the order book. The token is technically priced at 10,000. There were 10,000 tokens issued. There was $10,000 in the treasury. I don't think that it should trade at the treasury value because this is such a grand experiment. And so put 330 on the books, sell it at a dollar, and then realize there's no cancel button on the UI.
00:09:09.544 - 00:09:10.484, Speaker B: Oh, no.
00:09:12.584 - 00:09:55.924, Speaker C: Yeah. So started to look around. Dode built the UI in the community that we launched with and started to look around at that and then said, you know what? Like, I got to build the features I want if I'm going to start trading this stuff. So just started to pull the code base and push and started to integrate with everybody and say like, hey, this is what I'm working on. Hey, this doesn't work. And then that evolved into the trading interface that is currently deployed right now for metadao and Futarchy. And as that grew, the engagement for, or like, it at least was a signal to say like, hey, I want to work on this.
00:09:55.924 - 00:10:30.604, Speaker C: Im really keen on it. I think that one of my biggest things was ive been in crypto for a decade now professionally, and this was cool again. And it hearkened back to some of the early conversations with bitcoiners about micro loans and what could we do with bitcoin and what it was possible. And ive always felt that Daos were daos in name only. They weren't autonomous. They were bought votes, groups of five people. It was more like a board of a company than it was a DaO.
00:10:30.604 - 00:11:28.576, Speaker C: And to see something that was experimental and see something governed by markets, which I'm very familiar with, markets being brutal, they don't care about what you think. It's about what you know, and the price resolution and data flows and information flows for all that is really exciting to me because market theory makes a lot of sense as a trader. So as the, as we were going along, profit invited me to come to Mountain Dow. I had been traveling all the year before last or all last year, and I was like, I'm done traveling for a year. And I was like, is it really going to be worth it? And so I flew out to mountain Dow, and then everything kind of exploded once we were out there. And that was really exciting. And people were like, hey, ive got to refresh the UI to get order books updated and all this stuff that I saw people using it, and I was really engaged with seeing how people were using it.
00:11:28.576 - 00:12:05.804, Speaker C: And I kept hearkening back to like, this needs to be a professional tool, not a weekend hobby project. And so I contracted a friend of mine whos been doing UI with me for seven years. And at Moundow was like, hey, I want to pay you to start working on this. How much time do you have each week? And he was like, I can give you 10 hours. I was like, cool, I'm buying all of it. And so before even future was a service, I was like, I want this to be representative of a product that I would build and release to people. And then that naturally evolved as people saw the attention and the activity of it.
00:12:05.804 - 00:12:21.104, Speaker C: They said, hey, could we deploy this for our governance? Could we do this? And I was like, oh, this is much more interesting for other people, too, so maybe we can start to wrap all this stuff together. And that's kind of where where we got to today.
00:12:21.884 - 00:13:21.034, Speaker B: I just wanted to add what he said because he kind of, so the UI story is kind of interesting because it shows that metadata is still, like a very community led and governed project. So the story there was, when Metadao launched, I, as, like, the only member of Metadata team, had put out a UI. And I had never written UI before professionally because I've did smart contracts and before that, and web two did, like, APIs and backend stuff. And so the UI sucked. And so, but within a day, I believe there was a UI for metadata. It was just written by someone else. And then within, like, a few days, Dallik and a few other people had written on, had, like, worked on that, and it was way better than the original UI.
00:13:21.034 - 00:13:46.324, Speaker B: And, like, no one asked them to do that, right. They just, like, did that of their own volition, which I think is. And there was also no incentive. Like, no one to this day has been paid on working on that UI. We need to fix that like we should. But it was cool to me because it's like, okay, people are actually excited about this. This isn't just another project.
00:13:52.144 - 00:14:38.468, Speaker D: Yeah. And just as an observer from the outside, it definitely looks like a real Dao, not just in name, but like a credible coming together of like minded folks willing to try and change the world, really, with something like this. So it's a real grand experiment. And, I mean, that's the main reason we brought you on for a second time, to look into this, because it does feel like one of the most interesting things that's going on in crypto. Maybe just something which metan Alek was referring to, but maybe a problem that seems to have persisted so far is, like, a lack of liquidity or something like that. Because I've been looking through the proposals, and there was, proposal changed it from a clmm to an amm now to dutch auctions. You mentioned there's only 10,000 tokens.
00:14:38.468 - 00:14:53.224, Speaker D: I think the spread is massive. So why are there problems? And why didn't you just do maybe a more traditional token launch with millions of tokens airdrop to loads of people, and then maybe there'd be more liquidity going around?
00:14:55.584 - 00:15:54.844, Speaker B: Well, uh, the honest answer is I should have, uh, I think that's probably my biggest regret. Uh, but I'll tell you my theory, which was, uh, okay, these, each, each of these tokens are worth $1 because there's going to be $10,000 in the treasury. Uh, and so if I do like, very broad distribution, then, like, no one's going to care because these are going, the airdrop is going to be worth like a few pennies and so better to do it concentrated to like a few people and then we'll be able to like have a really tight community form. But I think that the tight community would have formed even if it like people hadn't gotten substantial airdrops. So yeah, if anyone else is listening to this and is considering doing a concentrated airdrop, I would say, please don't. Like you will. It's not ideal.
00:15:54.844 - 00:16:48.660, Speaker B: It's okay. Things will be okay. But yeah, it's definitely hurt on the liquidity side, but we're doing things to address that. So on the spot liquidity side, we'll potentially put some concentrated liquidity there. I mean that liquidity will naturally come with volume because volume is how market makers make their money and how amms make their money, like LP's. So thatll happen. But proposal liquidity is the problem that Im more focused on liquidity in the few target markets, which has been okay, better than I expected it was going to be, but still not ideal.
00:16:48.660 - 00:17:00.564, Speaker B: So to give some reference, I think the last time we looked at the numbers now it was like one hundred k to five hundred k in volume in each of the postal markets. Right. Something like that.
00:17:01.064 - 00:17:02.008, Speaker C: In aggregate.
00:17:02.096 - 00:17:44.270, Speaker B: Yeah, something like that, yeah. So that's not terrible. It's better than I expected, but still not great. And if you trade in the few target markets, you'll see that the slippage or the price impact is really high. What we need to do to address that, and what Robin Hanson actually suggested to us is to use an amm where essentially you incentivize people to provide liquidity in the sea turkic markets. And that is sustainable, unlike a lot of liquidity mining programs, because proposals actually create value for metadao. Right.
00:17:44.270 - 00:18:00.030, Speaker B: Like the governance process creates value. You could pay managers or you could pay people in few target markets. And so its sustainable to pay them long term. And so yeah, thats what we need to do to address that.
00:18:00.062 - 00:18:12.604, Speaker A: Preston, can you tell us a bit about what thats like? I guess in some ways working with Robin Hanson, the architect of this model here. And is he pretty engaged with crypto? It sounds like he kind of is.
00:18:14.344 - 00:18:48.384, Speaker B: It's awesome. I don't think he's super engaged with crypto. He didn't know what Solana was, he didn't know what ethereum was. But yeah, I mean it's been amazing to get very specific advice, very technical advice on what we should do. For example, he's given a lot of advice on how. How we should. How we should use our twap oracle, like how the high weighted average price oracle, like the statistical method it should use.
00:18:48.384 - 00:19:03.704, Speaker B: And, yeah, that's been great. Like, it. I couldn't. I mean, you can't really ask for better advice about a system other than the person who invented that system. So grateful that we've been able to steal some of this time.
00:19:04.324 - 00:19:11.664, Speaker D: And how's he feeling about seeing his creation actually come to life? Because obviously it just didn't really exist until metadata came about.
00:19:13.084 - 00:19:41.434, Speaker B: I don't know, wal. I think that he is excited, but I also think from what I've gathered when I talk to him, that he doesn't see what we've seen as new. I guess to him it all makes sense. Like Theatrechi as an idea, it makes sense. And I kind of share that. Like, the turkey isn't. It just makes sense.
00:19:41.434 - 00:20:11.526, Speaker B: And so when I told him, for example, that the markets had resisted manipulation, I was like, oh, yeah, by the way, we went through this proposal and this person tried to manipulate the markets and futurity just naturally resisted. And it proves that it's kind of showing that it's manipulation resistant. He was just like, yeah, I would expect that. And so, yeah, I don't think he sees anything new so far. Hopefully we can demonstrate some behavior that.
00:20:11.550 - 00:20:45.384, Speaker D: He hasn't thought about, but, yeah, and maybe met. But have you had any real extensive discussions with other teams who maybe want to integrate Futaki? Is there anything you can let us know about? The one that I saw on Twitter suggested, by the way, was ore this new Pow mining thing happening on Solana, I saw someone suggesting it should, or I think maybe the hard hat Chad saying that it should have a futuric governance associated with it. So, yeah, any of those chats happening?
00:20:46.004 - 00:21:50.358, Speaker C: Yeah, so, you know, we're working with Futuredao right now to get them integrated and definitely have conversations open, you know, with or in hard hat Chad about it because he's engaged with it. It's just a matter of, you know, know, what does it look like? How do we start to integrate that? How quickly can we get those things going? So we are launching with the current UI, with other daos if we can, but we're also charging ahead in our time. The estimated proposal launch or the launch for the Chitarki as a service is May 21. So that's when the new UI comes out that should be able to cater to multiple daos and have everything ready to go there. So in a way self service. But also we plan to help onboard other daos and have that user experience as well, so that it's not as cumbersome for other people. So I don't know how many people are waiting for that specifically.
00:21:50.358 - 00:22:08.604, Speaker C: But stuff is in motion too, just to use the current programs and the current code base for other dallas as well. I just don't know exactly their timeline, given some sensitivity tge. So some, some of that stuff I'm sure is, is constrained.
00:22:10.664 - 00:22:19.600, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess what I would say to the listeners, or just anyone is, uh, we probably can't say who, but just dows, you know, on Solana Defi.
00:22:19.632 - 00:22:53.384, Speaker A: Dows, you know, I saw recently you guys brought on Coliseum as an investor. Tell us a bit about that. I didn't see that coming, at least in the early days of metadao, but it seems like an elite organization here. Steward for a lot of hackathon projects in Solana has identified the metadao. Maybe the metadao ecosystem broadly is worthy of an investment. What was kind of their, how did that come to be? What's their objective with this?
00:22:54.564 - 00:23:50.514, Speaker B: Yeah, so the story was Pantera capital originally created proposal to buy meta to invest in Metadao, and their proposal failed because they set a maximum price that was too low. And the market said that it would be bad for metadatao if they let Pantera invest. Uh, and so that failed. And then there was the Ben proposal after that, which also failed. And then Coliseum created the third proposal, which I guess third times the charm. Uh, and yeah, they set some good, uh, like price parameters and stuff, or at least the market deemed it good enough to pass it. Um, and so, yeah, uh, they invested $250,000 into what I would consider like a pre seed stage startup Dao.
00:23:50.514 - 00:24:11.210, Speaker B: And, yeah, that's been great. We were just talking to them the other day about how we're going to structure our compensation, which is obviously going to be different than most projects. And yeah, they're super helpful and so.
00:24:11.242 - 00:24:26.214, Speaker D: Can you give a bit more colour on that? So are they starting a separate Dao? Like, is that what you were suggesting? So an early stage investment Dao using the futarchic model, or are they using the metadow to invest in other projects? Or am I completely wrong?
00:24:26.914 - 00:24:34.214, Speaker B: Oh no, they're invested in Metadao. So they bought meta tokens from the treasury.
00:24:34.834 - 00:25:21.766, Speaker C: Yeah. So they committed in the proposal that they wanted to run some tracks with Turkey and Medidao. So that was the other interesting component of the proposal and their engagement with it, it's been really great to communicate with Maddie, Clay, and Nate over there for these things. And once the proposal passed and everything was taken care of, they did a twelve. They, I think they got 20% upfront and then 80% is in a twelve month stream flow best. So, you know, once that was set up and done, they reached out and they were like, hey, you know, anything you guys need about anything, let us know. So we were able to con.
00:25:21.766 - 00:26:15.154, Speaker C: You know, it's, it's great to have somebody like that in the industry that's aligned with the industry as well. So I really, really engaged there and really interested to see how we can start to leverage this, because we've talked about, I don't know if you guys saw the Solana scribes hackathon. Yeah. That price pool that was also ongoing with all this interest. So, you know, it'll be interesting to see what people bring to the table when you start to look at these things in a, in a different way. I know that profit just brought up TWAP and how we're calculating that, or what other mechanisms are in here that we could start to leverage or use. I think it'll be really, really interesting to have a partner that has, like the hackathon track stuff that could really work to the benefit of getting a lot of these experiments that may not necessarily drive the revenue bottom line for Metadao, but may be quite interesting to play around with.
00:26:16.014 - 00:26:23.634, Speaker D: So with the idea of maybe bringing projects into metadao, would that be the broad idea?
00:26:24.734 - 00:27:18.368, Speaker C: Yeah. Projects or daos are solving problems that daos face in a very unique way. I know people have started to suggest different ideas on, well, we would like to do this, but maybe there's a way to restrict the people that can trade. Now, that's not exactly the idea behind Putarchy, but if that gets Dallas adopting and playing around with it, I think that that's certainly an interesting experiment to run with a lot of this stuff. I mean, I consider that you can crawl, walk, run with this stuff, so maybe you don't move the treasury over 100% to Futarchy, but you may run one proposal through that has $50,000 associated with it, and you want to see how it works. You want to see how it works within the community. So I think that there's a lot of stuff that daos can do that doesn't necessarily mean they're fully onboarded, but they can play around with it and see the effects.
00:27:18.536 - 00:27:34.264, Speaker D: Got it. And. Sorry, just one quick follow up, but I've never really seen DaO proposals before for people to buy the tokens, albeit on a twelve month vesting period. Is that because of the lack of liquidity or is there something else going on here? Why aren't they just buying from the open market?
00:27:35.644 - 00:27:37.464, Speaker B: Yeah, lack of liquidity.
00:27:38.004 - 00:27:38.904, Speaker D: Got it.
00:27:40.564 - 00:27:56.754, Speaker C: That. And then you don't necessarily, if you buy on the open market, you're not necessarily allocating those funds directly to the Dow. Whereas the DAO was the holder of the tokens. In this case, the treasury had it. And if you want to transfer USDC directly to the treasury, this would be the mechanism them to do so.
00:27:58.094 - 00:28:11.994, Speaker D: So why don't other Daos do that? Just spitballing. Why? Because you're right, it's better that the money goes into the Dow. Why aren't people proposing to buy arbitrum tokens, do you think?
00:28:14.494 - 00:28:54.286, Speaker B: Well, they probably, in Arbitrum's case, they probably don't need any cash. And they also have such a substantial token balance, like on the, uh, in their company. Right. Like with all these projects, uh, they have the equity and then the token. Like that's the thing that investors always talk about. It's like, okay, is the value going to flow to the equity or the token? Um, but normally the equity owns a lot of the token and so they can just sell it from Arbitrum foundation or like, yeah, optimism, I know, has done this where they do like OTC deals with market makers to sell op and then. Yeah.
00:28:54.286 - 00:28:56.234, Speaker B: So that's their way of doing it.
00:29:01.694 - 00:29:25.394, Speaker A: Can you tell us a bit? So we talked about Futarchy as a service. We talked about this idea that DAos can benefit from incorporating these few target primitives to improve governance, which I agree with. I think Dao governance has been an absolute nightmare for 90% of daos. Plus, what about this other thing, voda fi? What's the story with that? Where do you see that going?
00:29:26.734 - 00:30:50.288, Speaker B: Yeah, so I guess if the goal is to accelerate the target adoption, there are a few ways to do that. So you can show how great Futarchy is and you can get people to adopt, but, and you can also show how bad voting is and like highlight a major flaw in voting, which is that you can bribe like you should not be able to bribe to get decisions through, and yet you can in a voting system. And so we, and you actually, and you do like on ethereum, it's, you have like votium and hidden hands that are these huge markets. I think Vodium did like $50 million in revenue in 2021 where people trade their votes for money. So this didnt really exist on Solana. I think now theres one for Jupiter but we built it for Sabre and the idea would be that and we built that funded by Sabre, UXD and Solblaze because they were prospective bribers or I guess vote buyers, whichever term you prefer. And yeah, so that's live.
00:30:50.288 - 00:31:19.674, Speaker B: The hope is to generalize that to other markets. So maybe you could imagine people trading their Jup votes for money or anydao votes for money. And yeah, so that like right now I think we're just completely focused on future keys of service. And so VotA is probably not getting a lot of love, but that's the core idea is to like showcase a flaw with voting while making a little money in the process.
00:31:22.054 - 00:31:42.642, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. So you guys are almost, in a way trying to show how bad you built a product, to show how bad the thing is for governance. Because when I was perusing the website, I was kind of confused. Like interesting. So we're almost marketing this idea of trading voting power for money. There's this graphic on the homepage.
00:31:42.642 - 00:32:00.094, Speaker A: It's a little ominous looking. Okay, that's super interesting. But to your point, these days the focus is more on futarchies of service, which to me that feels like a very logical thing to put all the chips on for the time being.
00:32:01.654 - 00:32:02.014, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:02.054 - 00:32:24.954, Speaker D: Is it not, is it not possible to bribe using futaki? I was just trying to do in my head, but I think no, because if they're doing the pass vote, they're having to push up the price and they're having to put skin in the game. So they're, they're paying a higher price to, to eventually, hopefully receive a bribe, but they may be out of pocket, gone. You're more clever about this.
00:32:25.934 - 00:33:15.994, Speaker B: Yeah. One, we, one behavior we did see that was actually pretty interesting in the, Ben's proposal was he would place these high bids and people would sell into his high bids. Like this is expected behavior from a sea star key. This is what makes it work. But one interesting thing we saw was that once people had sold to his high bids. So like, I'm just going to make an example. I don't know if these are the right numbers, but like say the spot was $100 and he placed a bid at $200 and someone sold their meta to him at $200 in the past market and they know that it's going to go, it's going to be at $100 after the proposal passes.
00:33:15.994 - 00:34:06.584, Speaker B: And so they're essentially getting free money because they could buy back or they could keep some of the cash, then what would happen is they would then be incentivized for the proposal to pass because they would have this free money conditional on the proposal passing. And so you would see people stop selling into the high bids. In an efficient market, people keep coming in, or not in an efficient market, but just in a competitive market, people keep coming in as long as theres an opportunity to be had. But that was an interesting behavior we saw, is that once the manipulators and turn people on the other side of the book to their side by paying these egregious prices.
00:34:07.764 - 00:35:00.414, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that makes sense that he was just paying way over the odds and if it passes, then they would have been able to sell at those higher prices. One thing, and while we're slightly on the technical side of it, but I'm still confused I think about the fail market because I think it makes sense on the past market. If you think it's going to be accretive to the net value of the DAO, then you're buying the pseudo meta token in the belief that it will be worth more. And then if that passes then that purchase gone through and yeah, and then the new price should be higher. That's sort of my rough understanding, but I don't really understand on the fail market like who's buying fail meta and things like that. I think I'm a bit confused on that side still.
00:35:01.754 - 00:36:04.776, Speaker B: Well, anyone who believes the market is mispriced. So if say you believe that meta will trade at $100, if the proposal fails and someone is willing to sell their meta at I don't know, $80, then your incentivize to buy from them because then if it does fail, youll have locked in this lower bid and you can now sell at a higher price if youre correct. And so the reason intuitively you would just want to do it based on the past price and the spot price. So essentially if this makes number go up, then you do it. The problem is that over time, if a proposal is very likely to pass, then the pass price converges to the spot price because those two should. If its likely to pass, then if conditional and passing is the same as it. Thats the reason why you have to have a fail market.
00:36:04.776 - 00:36:28.944, Speaker B: I mean thats essentially what you want to do is just what would metadao be worth if it passed? What would metadao be worth if it failed and then only do the thing if it would be worth more if it passed. But yeah, I mean, we havent seen exactly what type of traders trade in both markets, but I think its just people who are trying to make money, essentially.
00:36:29.364 - 00:36:29.900, Speaker C: Preston.
00:36:29.972 - 00:36:48.644, Speaker A: So you guys have had a few months now of seeing how the real world interacts with metadata. What have been some unforeseen, I guess, challenges or drawbacks of this approach, that maybe they're solvable, maybe not, but have come to your attention?
00:36:50.504 - 00:37:44.476, Speaker B: Well, I would say that the one I talked about a minute ago, where you can kind of buy out people on the other side of the market is an interesting one that we didn't expect. But other than that, I think that everything we've seen has been solvable. Liquidity is definitely an issue, but that's an engineering problem. You can throw an amm at that and then incentivize the amm and it's sustainable because you get value out of governance and there will be liquidity. So other than that, oh, yeah. I mean, there has been one issue where like, okay, say a proposal is very likely to pass, right? Like everyone believes the proposal is likely to pass. The pass price is two x to fail price.
00:37:44.476 - 00:39:13.434, Speaker B: Then there's not really a strong incentive to trade in the fail market because those markets are, those trades are not going to be, like, finalized, right? Like, if I sell my bail meta for fail USDC, it doesn't really matter. Like, neither of both of those things are worth zero, and so it doesn't matter. And that doesn't really matter for us right now because the only thing that matters is relative, like whether the pass price, whether it's worth more if it passes or fails. But if you were trying to extract the dollar quantity from, like, how much a proposal, how much value a proposal created, it would be a problem, right? Like, if a proposal, you could theoretically say that if a proposal like two x is the value of meta, like, maybe the valuation in the fail market is 100 million, and in the past market it's 200 million. Like, you could say that the proposal creates $100 million worth of value and you could use that information to pay out. Maybe you give $10 million worth of value to the people who created the proposal, for example. But because the fail market becomes nihilistic or doesn't mean anything, in the case where it's unlikely to resolve, then it just become like you can't really do something.
00:39:13.434 - 00:39:20.226, Speaker B: And so I'm not sure if we'll be able to come up with, like, a solution to that, but im hopeful. William?
00:39:20.250 - 00:39:54.214, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we touched upon this maybe during the last episode where if you want more than just a yes or a no pass or a fail, thats basically what youre just saying, that its very tricky to be able to incentivize both sides of the market. Is that basically what youre saying or can you see a world in which it can evolve and, and have, I don't know, multiple options or as you said, maybe depending how much more it is over the fail market, then we'll do x or y action, maybe.
00:39:55.554 - 00:40:34.014, Speaker B: So you can do multiple options. That's not live today. But it's actually pretty simple from an engineering perspective to do that. But you can't, yeah, that is actually an issue with the target is you can't decide over continuous quantities. So that's like an abstract statement. So specifically, you couldn't, at least as far as I know, you couldn't use futurkey to decide someone's salary. You could use it to decide whether or not to pay them 100k or 200k or $0 to not hire them.
00:40:34.014 - 00:40:53.124, Speaker B: But I can't think of a way that you could use it to, to set a salary where I guess with voting you kind of could, you could have everyone put in what they think the person should be paid and then average over those or some aggregation algorithm.
00:40:53.424 - 00:41:05.464, Speaker D: But yeah, couldn't you just have loads of options like $5,000 increments and then whichever one is the highest would be the salary?
00:41:06.204 - 00:41:13.864, Speaker B: I guess you could, liquidity would probably be the issue if you had like yeah, 5000 options or something.
00:41:15.164 - 00:41:45.704, Speaker C: And I think the user experience there too, right. If you had, how do you display that? What do you know? Like how are people trading that? What does that look like? I mean, I think you kind of get back to this. I think I've circled back to a proposal probably is best served just like a business makes a proposal, right? Or if you're going to make a decision, you make a decision. You can make a decision on partial information, but you estimate as best as you can to be able to deliver on it. Because if it's not that, then.
00:41:48.044 - 00:41:48.332, Speaker B: What.
00:41:48.348 - 00:41:49.664, Speaker C: Are you effectively doing?
00:41:50.484 - 00:42:22.424, Speaker D: And maybe that slightly comes into one of the other proposals that I've seen recently, which is about you looking to have a benevolent dictator in charge, because maybe it's a bit slow to do things. We've seen, I suppose with a lot of the previous DaO governance attempts that you do sort of need this central core really to be putting in the work to propose things. So is that how you see it? Are you surprised for the need for a benevolent dictator or how you see that progressing?
00:42:23.604 - 00:43:15.322, Speaker B: Yeah, so now and I are officially appointed today, benevolent dictator for three months. So we were appointed at the start of April and I guess end of June would be the end of our term. And the goal is actually to never have to raise that proposal again. And I think it's possible, and I know that deems untrue that maybe we'll devolve into the other voting systems. But I think puturkey is different. So, like, you can, the way you can think about it is that every decision making system has throughput and it has latency, just like the blockchain. Uh, throughput is like how many decisions it can do at once or like in a given month.
00:43:15.322 - 00:44:00.702, Speaker B: Right. Like how many proposals could you do in a given month? And then, uh, latency is how long it takes to make a decision. Um, and in a voting system, your attention constraints, you need the attention of all the people who own your tokens, or at least who have been delegated tokens. You need their attention on all these matters in order for you to come to decisions. And that's an issue. But in a futur key, turkey is governed by markets. And in a market, you actually only need one well capitalized actor to set the price correctly.
00:44:00.702 - 00:44:46.614, Speaker B: Like, you only need one maker to set prices around where they are accurate and then maybe like one other person to keep them honest, like to trade against them when their prices are wrong. And so I think you can get throughput and the latency, the throughput way up and the latency way down. And so thats our goal during our turn. And thats the amm thats improving the time weighted average price oracle and a bunch of other low level stuff. But I am fairly confident that we wont need to raise another proposal again, that essentially it will be the market in control at the end of two.
00:44:52.014 - 00:45:20.090, Speaker A: How do you guys see metadata playing out now that there's this focus on Futarchy as a service? Is that kind of the goal is just to get this experimented on with completely separate organizations and daos? Or do you actually see the metadao itself scaling up to be this massive thing where theres tons of liquidity and proposals flowing through? How do you guys envision this in the next few years?
00:45:20.202 - 00:46:45.730, Speaker B: Trey? Well, id say theres the short term plan, which is just getting futarchy working, but the long term plan is, well, yeah, metadata originally comes from like Dao of daos. And there are essentially, like, the reason why I started metadao. It was actually not just Futarchy but it was a solution to a problem that I had, which is say you want to build a corporation like a big corporation, right? Because corporations have benefits, right? Like economies of scale, economies of scope. They can, yeah, like fix costs. They can leverage fixed costs across many business units, like a common brand, and regulatory, like capture, they can, they can influence regulations to help themselves. All that is to say corporations, there's a reason why big companies exist. But startups also have benefits like autonomy, and they seem to be much more effective at getting stuff done and they're much less political and bureaucratic.
00:46:45.730 - 00:48:14.150, Speaker B: And so could you build a large organization that's governed as kind of like a series of startups amalgamated into like a single political entity that has these benefits of a big company? And futarchy, I believe, is the only way you can really do that, because if you don't have futurchy, then you have all these incentive traps. So an example of this would be, yeah, okay, say you've got a company like a megacorp that's governed as a series of startups, and the brand that all these business units share, it relies on it being a trusted brand, and that's very helpful to all these business units. And then one business unit wants to launch a product under that brand that's like a degenerate product. I don't know, maybe it's like some sort of, I don't know, maybe it's crypto related. And so, yeah, that would be ev plus for that individual business unit because they could make money and profit off of it. Or if it's potentially ev plus for that business unit while being EV minus for the organization as a whole. Right.
00:48:14.150 - 00:49:15.368, Speaker B: Because it hurts the brand and hurts these other business units. And that is a very important problem. And that is why organizations like why companies are organized the way that they are under this empire structure where everyone reports to a single CEO and a single board of directors, so that people are at least accountable to the organization as a whole and can't just maximize their own business at the expense of everyone else. And so I think futarchy, though is a way that you could actually have these smaller teams, but that are compelled to work for the broader organization because they're accountable to the markets. And I hope that Medidao could be such an entity. And thats definitely the goal. Yeah, I guess.
00:49:15.368 - 00:49:27.164, Speaker B: But yeah, short term, were just, were not really focused on that broad vision. Were trying to make but turkey work. But I hope that we can get to a place where metadata is an important political and economic entity.
00:49:29.704 - 00:50:20.484, Speaker D: Just one other tangent that itd be maybe interesting to go down. But I think the other interesting concept which is really coming to the fore, this bull market is prediction markets, which isn't too far removed from what's happening with metadata, but there are crucial differences. So I suppose it's a general. What is your view on prediction markets? Are you a fan? Do you think that that could take over? I suppose polling and things like that. And secondly, if we were going to maybe like uh, propose who should be the next president of the United States, like you can have that with either model presumably. But yeah, I'm just trying to work out my head what it would, what would be the bit, the difference in results and yeah, if you could just enlighten me on that, please.
00:50:20.944 - 00:51:41.304, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So prediction markets are kind of interesting because they do showcase what a live Utah key could look like. So they run prediction markets on who's going to win the election and they also run prediction markets on who is going to win the party nomination. And what's interesting is that at least at the time I looked at the prediction market, if you looked at it, I believe at the time Joe Biden had an 80% chance of winning the democratic nominee and then a 40% chance of winning the overall election. And so essentially the market is saying that if he wins the democratic nominee, theres a 50% chance that he will win the overall election, which sounds about right to me. And then Michelle Obama on the other hand, she had, I think a 10% chance of winning the democratic nomination and then an 8% chance or something in that order of magnitude of winning the overall election.
00:51:41.304 - 00:51:59.208, Speaker B: So essentially the market was saying that Michelle Obama would have an 80% chance of winning if he were nominated as the democratic, like the person who runs for president, what is that called?
00:51:59.296 - 00:52:00.564, Speaker D: Democratic nominee.
00:52:01.024 - 00:52:57.574, Speaker B: Yeah, nominee. And so if the Democratic Party, obviously, I don't know if Michelle Obama wants to run for president, but just if you assume that she does, then the Democratic Party would almost double their odds of winning, at least according to the market if they were following but Turkey. And so yeah, I think prediction markets are kind of like one showcase of this. And obviously prediction markets for presidential candidates have been way better than pollsters and predicting whos going to win. But then back to your other question of how would this actually look if you wanted to have a futarchy elect a president? What would it look like? So obviously governments don't have stocks. There's no us stock. I guess there's the s and P 500, but we probably don't want to just do things that make number go up with a country.
00:52:57.574 - 00:54:09.474, Speaker B: Maybe we want to also increase the happiness of our citizens and things like that. The way that you could do it or would do it is you create financial contracts that pay out relative to these other things that you want to have happen. So like, if you want to increase satisf, say you, Dave, want to increase satisfaction of Davistan, that's like your objective function. You want all your residents of Davis, Stan, to be very happy and satisfied all the time. What you could do is you could run a, instead of having people vote every year, you have them fill out a survey every year where they say, like, how satisfied am I with my life or how happy was I this year? And maybe they can put in a number from zero to five. And then you create financial contracts that pay out relative to what they put in. So say if people on app, the citizens of Davistan are on average four out of five happy in 2024, then your contracts pay out $4.
00:54:09.474 - 00:54:59.196, Speaker B: Or if they're 1.5 happy, then they only pay out $1.50. And then because you now have a price around, you've now put a price on satisfaction. In effect, you can use a few turkey where people bid on those contracts and you just do whatever will increase the price of those contracts the most. So if Joe Biden, if the contracts are, I don't know, trading at like $3 in Joe Biden's case, and, I don't know, $4 in Trump's case, then essentially the market is saying that people will be one point happier in Davis. And if Trump is elected. I know, sorry, I'm mixing us and Davis now.
00:54:59.196 - 00:55:42.044, Speaker B: But you get the point. Create financial contracts that pay out relative to these things, to these other, I guess, softer, non, just stock price. And then, yeah, you can run, but on that, you can also run it on this is what Robin has talked about. You can do it based on citizenship. So if you allow people to trade their citizenships freely, which I don't know of any government that does do this, you could try to maximize the value of your citizenship. So whatever makes the pricier citizenship go up is what you do.
00:55:42.584 - 00:56:16.074, Speaker A: It's fascinating. Never thought about that. So we covered a lot of topics today. I think a closing question for me is what has been, where have you guys found PMF with other daos who are looking to add more of these primitives? What has been, I guess, the most pressing, I don't know, issue with governance that other daos, or even just like even a type of product has resonated the most with what you guys have already been building.
00:56:16.374 - 00:57:13.162, Speaker C: I think, obviously, the solution for attention, you don't have these issues of quorum. Now, there comes a time that you have to have the handing over authority to these systems, which may be uncomfortable for a lot of daos, and a lot of daos haven't done that with systems they've built with Aragon, I think so. I think first is you solve an attention problem for quorum and activity with your governance token, which in turn creates value for your governance token. If you can do that. I think the interesting aspect of focus on the proposal, like having a value out adding proposal, means that you've kind of constrained what you need to be able to produce there. It can't be some arbitrary decision making. It's got to be something that raises the bar.
00:57:13.162 - 00:57:41.124, Speaker C: And I think that that's been quite interesting with respect to that. Obviously, a hot governance token will not necessarily mandate the requirement of something like this. But if you have something that is stagnant or you are struggling to get those thresholds met, this is a natural solution to still be able to use Dao governance without that restriction or without having to create insiders or any groups like that.
00:57:41.624 - 00:58:44.654, Speaker B: Yeah, and so, I mean, I think now I've touched on a core one, which is attention. Uh, like, people want to solve this attention problem where, like, they don't have to keep riling up the troops every time you, uh, create a governance proposal, which is, like, totally reasonable, and then I think the other one is just quality of decision making. Jupiter Dao is probably the hottest dao in all of crypto right now, possibly of all time in terms of engagement. And yet recently it passed a Dao vote that would allow Sharkey to launch with 1% float. Like, obviously a horrible predatory system that's going to make Jupiter eventually look bad. And so, yeah, I think it's just like seeing time and time again the quality of decisions, of voting be bad. This could solve an issue for them.
00:58:45.794 - 00:59:08.586, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Well, guys, this has been a super fun conversation. Really impressed with just the traction that metadata has gotten, the attention it's gotten, and super excited for what's to come and all the products that you guys are continuing to build, all the daos that you're continuing to influence here. So profit and metanolik, thank you so much for joining us today.
00:59:08.690 - 00:59:09.354, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:59:09.474 - 00:59:11.434, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you so much for having us on.
