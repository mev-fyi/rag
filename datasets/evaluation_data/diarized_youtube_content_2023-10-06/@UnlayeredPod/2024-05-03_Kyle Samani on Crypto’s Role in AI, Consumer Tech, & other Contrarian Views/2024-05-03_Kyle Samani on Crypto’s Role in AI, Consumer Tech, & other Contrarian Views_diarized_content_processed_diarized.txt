00:00:14.040 - 00:00:35.580, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered. We're here with Kyle Simoni of Multicoin. Although our guest this week is a managing partner of a registered investment advisor, nothing in this podcast should be considered an offer of Multicoin's investment advisory services, or should be otherwise be confused for investment tax, legal, or other financial advice. And with that, welcome to Unlayer. Kyle. How's it going?
00:00:35.692 - 00:00:47.464, Speaker B: Sal, pleasure to be on the show. Fantastic to see all of you. I love your background. That is epic. I see some speakers. I see a pretty large gaming setup. Maybe that's a coding setup, too.
00:00:47.464 - 00:00:51.388, Speaker B: That's one of the more epic, epic backgrounds I've seen in a while.
00:00:51.476 - 00:00:59.356, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Here in New York City, one bed life. So gotta just jam everything in this living room. Everyone gets. Just gets to see my business.
00:00:59.356 - 00:01:00.300, Speaker A: That's how it is.
00:01:00.372 - 00:01:02.828, Speaker B: Well, cool. Let's jump into some crypto stuff, guys.
00:01:02.956 - 00:01:29.858, Speaker A: Want to kick it off with just 10,000 foot view what's going on in these markets. Obviously, fundraising data, no matter what you're looking at, it's just down a lot from the year prior. And simultaneously, there's a lot of excitement, or I guess, focus rather. If you look at what happened in ECC, tons of. Tons of infra, not a ton of, I guess, like end applications. I don't know. Do you have any thoughts kind of taking that high level view on what's happening these days?
00:01:30.026 - 00:01:49.962, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a little frustrating. I didn't go to etc. But I've listened to probably four or five podcast summaries. I've scrolled Twitter extensively and warpcast extensively trying to get a sense of it, and obviously spoke with my team members who, who were there. Pretty consensus view is, you know, not many interesting apps. Lots of infra. Look, there.
00:01:49.962 - 00:02:19.340, Speaker B: There is at some point in which, like, the infra needs to get to the point where you can build apps, like, obviously. But also, I think we're at the point where you can do that, at least to some degree. Like, you can build something interesting on arbitrum and optimism in their current forms. Ignore the fact that kind of the fraud proofs aren't really there, but, like, you can do some interesting stuff and just. It's not there. Even world coin, which like, it's kind of an app, but really is more infrastructure. Worldcoin is really an API for social media companies to fight spam bots.
00:02:19.340 - 00:02:42.464, Speaker B: There's really more infrastructure than app. So I was a little frustrated with that. At the same time as etc. Solana hosted this pretty low key Solana games day in San Diego that overlapped with Comic Con. And I went to that for it was two days, and I went to day two. I skipped day one. Most of my team was pretty confused as to why I went.
00:02:42.464 - 00:03:29.224, Speaker B: Multicoin has invested in one game or zero, depending on how you want to count. So we have generally not invested in crypto gaming for a bunch of reasons. And I went in to the event actually with pretty low expectations, not as a reflection of any particular game developer, but just like I was, like at crypto gaming, I'm not there. And I came away pretty pleasantly surprised. There were 40 teams representing games, all playable, most of which should release in the back half of this year. Most of the games that were there are already in public beta of alpha or beta of various forms, and they seem like things that could gain traction. Nothing struck me as a game I would particularly play, but I kind of tend to be the Zelda type, which is a pretty different type of game.
00:03:29.224 - 00:03:54.664, Speaker B: The thing that I didn't like about the games stuff I saw was the crypto integrations were not as awesome as I was hoping. They were fine, but they didn't feel like they were changing the gameplay experience too materially. The one exception being there are a handful of teams playing with basically PvP. Bet. Bet against your friends, or bet against who you're playing with. And that's obviously not a new idea. This has obviously been an idea people have joked about for 20 or 30 years.
00:03:54.664 - 00:04:27.684, Speaker B: It's possible that now is the time, and specifically in the context of streamers, is actually pretty interesting. If you're a streamer and you're really good at CoD, I bet you a lot of your fans would be very happy to play a match with you knowing they're going to lose 510 $20 just to play with Ninja or whoever their famous streamer is. So I think there's an interesting play there. And obviously streamers act as a natural distribution channel. I kind of got on. Your original question was apps versus infra. I highlighted all this just because I'm spending most of my time thinking about either apps or new kinds of infra.
00:04:27.684 - 00:05:06.400, Speaker B: So meaning not l one, l two, but things like Filecoin, things like cryptographic primitives, those kinds of things. And I really think we have enough infra that you can build usable experiences. And I think the kind of onus is on us as an industry to figure those out deep in is pretty exciting. It's an app in some ways, but obviously it's not like Snapchat or Reddit, like something that is kind of more universally understandable. But I'm pretty optimistic there and I generally want just, I'm pretty focused on pushing everyone in our portfolio and around multicoin to figure out apps. That's really all that matters at this stage.
00:05:06.592 - 00:05:19.288, Speaker A: And are you seeing on the deal flow side, are there more builders that are building apps or is it a two sided problem here where both investors are preferring infra and people aren't building it for that reason? What are you seeing there?
00:05:19.336 - 00:05:51.064, Speaker B: Are people doing apps? I mean, say the ratio of infra deals to app deals is, I would guess, market wide. I don't know, six to one if I were to kind of venture a guess. So, pretty skewed. Multicoin has done one app deal in the last month. I think we've looked at several more that we've passed on from pretty credible or thoughtful founders. So there are people out there doing stuff. But definitely, I wish that ratio was flipped.
00:05:51.064 - 00:06:00.816, Speaker B: That's kind of my biggest problem. Like, you never want to stop investing in infra. Obviously, Infra always needs to improve, but the ratio kind of take for granted. My six to one comment is roughly correct.
00:06:00.920 - 00:06:01.424, Speaker A: Sure.
00:06:01.544 - 00:06:08.632, Speaker B: Which I don't think most people would seriously push back on that ratio. I think the market should be one to six, not six to one.
00:06:08.768 - 00:06:11.624, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. You want to see a flipping of that.
00:06:11.784 - 00:06:12.920, Speaker B: That's correct. Yes.
00:06:13.032 - 00:06:13.232, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:13.248 - 00:06:38.074, Speaker C: I suppose when you think about Web two, I suppose the infrastructure had to be built out and then suddenly you had that cambrian explosion of the application. Do you think it's just a case of, we just need that first one, really to hit true product market fit outside of the crypto circles before suddenly people say, okay, you can actually make good money and there is an audience which can be attracted.
00:06:38.494 - 00:07:12.750, Speaker B: That's right. And it needs to be consumer facing. I mean, I love deep multicoint going to help pioneer deepen. So we obviously have spent a lot of time there working very closely with helium and Hivemapper and then render and Filecoin and some other things as well, although those are a little different than helium and Hivemapper, but those aren't. Those don't capture consumer attention in the way that like, Reddit does or whatever, so, or Robin Hood. So, yeah, I think the, the bar in my mind is, is consumer. You know something, my mom, if, even if she wouldn't use it, would at least like, understand it.
00:07:12.750 - 00:07:34.254, Speaker B: And that, that is in my, like, the single most important question. And I believe the tooling exists today to do that. At least on Solana, on, on arbitrum, that's less clear or optimism. But, like, you have, the gas fees are low enough. You can abstract, you can have, you know, the developer could pay for gas. You've got, you know, social sign on and account abstraction and all that stuff. Like it's there.
00:07:34.254 - 00:07:47.664, Speaker B: Latency is low enough. Like, you can build these experiences. Dialect is a great example. Dialect is not yet, you know, a mainstream consumer app. Chris and the team are playing with a bunch of interesting. We're investors in dialect. Chris and the team are playing with a bunch of interesting ideas.
00:07:47.664 - 00:08:16.354, Speaker B: Hopefully that kind of breaks out to mainstream. We'll see. But we just need, we need something to hit. And I think it's pretty lazy to say, like, the infra is not ready. Like stuff where far caster works, like the dialect works, we can get these things. And, like, you want to be able to at least iterate and see these experiments running and unlocking these social behaviors, like, all the other variables don't matter. It'll be amazing how quickly perceptions and discourse will change when there is market wide consensus.
00:08:16.354 - 00:08:24.182, Speaker B: This app is a big deal and will generally capture consumer mainstream attention. All prior discourse will stop mattering.
00:08:24.318 - 00:08:58.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk a bit about that because you brought up Farcaster, and obviously some go to examples of successful web, two apps, Snapchat, Reddit, things like that. My question has always been lens protocol. Farcaster, they're out. They've been out for a while. I've used them, but it's unclear to me. How exactly does crypto make this a better app, so to speak? Like, theoretically, people care about the social graph and portability of that. In practice, I kind of push back on, like, the reason why I use YouTube is because MrBeast is on there, not because, you know, he can move his followers from one place to another.
00:08:58.394 - 00:09:15.184, Speaker A: That's why he's spending so much money on those videos, by the way. It's because the reach is just massive. It's hundreds of millions, not tens of thousands. So I guess my question is, what is the low hanging fruit for crypto to improve a consumer app? Like, how can they actually be ten to 100 x better than existing apps?
00:09:15.764 - 00:09:42.064, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can't compete against these apps that you just named, or that I've named on the vectors that matter for them, which I'm going to just loosely call. They have the content you want, whether that comes from your friends or from the recommendation algorithm or whatever. Web three doesn't compete there. Web three, you know, there's like at the social layer, there's like interesting theories of what web3 enables. One is like ownership graph. I'm kind of skeptical of that theory, but there's a bunch of people playing around with that idea.
00:09:42.064 - 00:10:15.202, Speaker B: Another is like the kind of fan club NFT gated private community idea. Again, I'm pretty skeptical there, but there's a bunch of people playing with those ideas. A third is layering financialization into some of these behaviors. That one is the one I'm kind of the most interested in. And that maps like best to Twitter, or at least that maps better to Twitter than it does to Instagram or YouTube or TikTok or Snapchat, if such a thing is going to work. It's not that you beat Twitter on having a better algorithm. That's not the thing.
00:10:15.202 - 00:10:55.612, Speaker B: You have to layer in some notion of financialization in a way that's compelling. That might be be a vector that matters. If you look at dialect, the kind of core theory, there is a new opportunity for creator monetization, for creators, and it's bundling both the revenue opportunity with this kind of new communication media, which is these private chat rooms where the creator is there with some of the superfans. The goal is to create a new kind of experience for people to interact with those creators. Unclear if that scales to huge volumes, but like maybe there's something there. There's other vectors people are playing with around these things. So I haven't named all of them.
00:10:55.612 - 00:11:34.400, Speaker B: But my point is though, is that if there's going to be a large scale, successful web3 consumer thing, it's going to need to lean pretty strongly into like one of these social attributes. Either that I have identified or there's others that I missed in that kind of quick rant. But that's going to be the key. You have to believe that those things unlock some sort of new behavior in psychology that didn't exist before and that are kind of inherently tied to status access, money trading in some way that's meaningful. Another interesting one is social tokens. There's obviously been a handful of attempts at social tokens. As far as I can tell, all of them have flopped.
00:11:34.400 - 00:11:52.330, Speaker B: The newest iteration of this seems to be a thing called unlonly, which disclosure we are investor in. I think social tokens will be a thing, and they map pretty well to crypto. So maybe that's the right vector to get to large scale social consumer thing. I don't know. It's just a theory.
00:11:52.482 - 00:12:36.610, Speaker C: Yeah, we've spoken on this pod previously about how it feels that speculation is the true product market fear of crypto. And so if you're going to have a successful social application, it feels like it somehow needs to embed some form of speculation within it. But just veering from that. Recently we spoke to guys from underdog protocol. I'm not sure if you're aware of them, but they're talking about as well the importance, if you're going to do these social applications, of gathering data basically from the users and maybe using something like compressed nfts to allow that. Do you have any thoughts on, I think, collection of data and how it can be used within social applications, but also more generally within crypto?
00:12:36.742 - 00:12:57.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, compressed nfts are, I kind of don't think of them as a feature. I just think take it as like a given. Like, we need cheap transactions. Like, I invested in Solana because I wanted cheap transactions. Obviously nfts were not as cheap as like they needed to be, and now they are. And now I'm kind of done thinking about it as like a thing. What drip house is doing is interesting.
00:12:57.210 - 00:13:34.322, Speaker B: And just like, he's just scaling just tons of NFT. I think they've minted 16 million nfts in like two or three months or something. By far the largest minter of nfts across any platform. What's unclear is what do you do with all these things? And a bunch of people are playing with those. But at least what that is enabling is we can now run the experiment of if you multiply the total number of these things by a factor of 1000, does that create an opportunity for new behaviors? Maybe, I don't know. But I like that as an experiment. Obviously, if anyone is going to bring nfts into an app with existing distribution, this is kind of a no brainer.
00:13:34.322 - 00:13:45.454, Speaker B: Shopify has talked a lot about a bunch of various ideas. Obviously, Instagram flirted with a bunch of these ideas. If you're going to do any of these things at scale, the cost needs to be very close to zero.
00:13:45.834 - 00:14:31.238, Speaker A: One thing I wanted to also bring up, I wrote about the financialization of nfts last summer, and I remember reading your blog post on the verticalization of NFT marketplaces last summer. And just the timing was so interesting because basically after that we saw the rise of tensor on Solana blur. We saw magic Eden and Opensea kind of lose their market lead over the marketplaces. And it didn't seem like, because I think I agreed with a lot of the things you mentioned in there. It just makes sense that you would have a devoted kind of gaming focused NFT marketplace and one for pfps and one for ens type stuff. But yet here we are today, and people are still kind of doing similar stuff with these pro trading oriented interfaces. Maybe, but I don't know.
00:14:31.238 - 00:14:36.174, Speaker A: Has your thesis evolved since last summer on what's happening with marketplaces for nfts?
00:14:36.334 - 00:15:10.060, Speaker B: The one word answer is no. The more nuanced answer is. One thing that's very difficult in investing is you have a theory, let's say over the next 24 months. Your theory appears to not be valid or not be working, but also doesn't appear to be invalid either. There's no definitive thing that's happening that's stating definitively the theory is wrong. And I think kind of NFT land is, in the context of my blog post, is in that state of the world. But there are a few leading indicators suggesting my theory is right, which the most notable of which I'd say is pudgy penguins.
00:15:10.060 - 00:15:33.554, Speaker B: Actually, I recently listened to a podcast with Luca, the founder of Pudgy Penguins, or, sorry, not the founder. He, like, bought out pudgy penguins in some sort of distressed thing, like, a year ago. And I was pretty intrigued by the guy and his story and what he's trying to do with pudgy penguins. So I went to go buy some, and what I realized very quickly was pudgy penguins all trade on their own marketplace on pudgypenguins.com dot. And I was like, oh, awesome. They're not.
00:15:33.554 - 00:16:00.670, Speaker B: They're not an opensea. Nothing against Opensea. I was just like, I've been waiting for, like, a team to do this, and I was like, awesome. I didn't know about it, obviously. I'm kind of late to the party on that one, but that one struck me as like, okay, here's a founder who, like, has a vision, who's building towards his vision, and he understands that, like, you need to own that experience. And if you go to the Pudgypengs website, you know, they have their collectibles, they have the plush toys. They're obviously working on some sort of new media, whether it's a Netflix show or a game, I don't really know.
00:16:00.670 - 00:16:43.272, Speaker B: Luca hasn't talked about it publicly yet, but it's pretty obvious that all of those things are going to tie in and they're going to be all available on pudgypenguins.com. and so I kind of look at them as, like, one of the leading groups who are kind of proving out my core theory, my sense is that once you have, you know, a team that's done it correctly, that a lot more teams will follow in terms of copying. We had this weird dynamic in the market where just speculation was most of what drove the market. And so that leads to magic Eden and then tensor and blur. But that's not the sustainable long term thing. That doesn't mean that those products will go away or that they'll be bad. It's just we need a new class of tools to be built out.
00:16:43.272 - 00:16:59.610, Speaker B: I'd say it's taken longer than we would have expected for NFT communities to kind of go down this pudgy penguins route. But I'm excited there's at least one group doing it. I'm sure there's a handful of others that I'm not aware of that are kind of going down similar routes. So I'm excited to see it and I think something productive will emerge from it.
00:16:59.802 - 00:17:31.553, Speaker A: Right, right. And on, like the owners, Yuga Labs, sorry, Apecoinda, I think, has their own like marketplace, right? They might redirect royalties from sales of like board apes and stuff back to the Daos. I also see like that kind of playing out, even if you just look at outside of nfts, like the Unibot telegram kind of wave telegram bot wave for they have tokens, but there's some rev share arrangement, so it incentivizes people to buy, hold and then use a platform that could also be a vector which encourages these verticalized marketplaces.
00:17:32.773 - 00:17:48.278, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if you are not a speculator, but you are genuinely engaging with these things, then going to opensea or magic Eden or tensor or blur doesn't make sense. And I think slowly these communities will shift kind of away from that.
00:17:48.406 - 00:18:08.456, Speaker A: Well, surely there has to be some aggregation at some point, right? Because then we can't have 10,000 siloed off. And then, so someone has to, at the front end, aggregate, like the buy and sell of these, even if the profits go back to those marketplaces. That's the thing. I think people kind of things do trend back towards like curation and aggregation, I feel.
00:18:08.630 - 00:18:42.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I push back on that. I mean, look, if you, if you're trying to buy across five different collections at the same time, then you probably don't care about any one collection. If you are buying from whatever you're really in the apes, like you want to go to the marketplace explorer and everything, you probably are going to buy there. So there's just two different audiences here and these audience audiences will coexist. I'm going to loosely call them the speculator audience and the non speculator audience, and those people want different things in how they handle discovery, curation, et cetera.
00:18:46.804 - 00:19:17.052, Speaker C: I'd love to just to turn the conversation towards AI. It feels increasingly clear that there is going to be a big crossover, really, between crypto and AI. And you recently did a blog post where you talked about four potential intersections, one of them which I haven't really heard you speak much about, on reinforced learning with human input. So it'd be great if you could expand on your thesis there, and also if there are any other areas that you feel could come about following that article, if you've come up with any other ideas.
00:19:17.188 - 00:20:07.428, Speaker B: Yeah, so I wrote this article a month or two ago about intersections of crypto and AI. I highlighted four areas, four or five eyes wide open, that there are a lot of other things other investors have written that cover some of the ideas I touched on, as well as another dozen or two dozen others. I chose not to highlight the other dozen or two dozen that I've seen and discussed with people, not because they're not interesting, but because they either felt further out or just much harder to monetize. And I wanted to keep it focused on bigger picture, nearer term things. Of the four things I identified in my article, the one that is definitely the most important is Airbnb for your graphics card. Every week a new headline comes about about shortages and this and that and the other. I think there's like pseudo consensus in the like equity analyst market that the shortages will be resolved by Q.
00:20:07.428 - 00:20:43.496, Speaker B: It was Q four of this year, now it's Q two of next year. I'm going to go crazy on this one and say I think the shortage is like three years out, like before. It's resolved at least from centralized providers because, like, you can't make building a new fab takes a long time. And so, like, demand just went up ten x and supply went up Zero X. And so there's kind of like a fundamental mismatch here. There's obviously some slack in the system and you can try and repurpose some of that slack, but that's already been maxed out at this point and you can see that in Nvidia's numbers pretty clear. So that's the most important thing.
00:20:43.496 - 00:21:15.968, Speaker B: I think there's a lot of overly technical criticisms of that thesis, which is like, not all models will run on all cards and consumer cards aren't good enough. Yeah, like, for sure, like, there's a million we are technical subtleties that impact these things. And like diffusion models versus LLMs and like how much context window and memory. And like you can quickly tie yourself up in a lot of technical details. But I kind of think it's missing the point. It's missing the forest for the trees. It's just like demand has gone up at least ten x in the last six months.
00:21:15.968 - 00:22:14.640, Speaker B: I think demand will go up another hundred x in the next 36 months like from here, which is pretty crazy to think about. And so like if that's directionally correct, then like the whole market will reorient itself around. How do I find any piece of silicon anywhere, even if it is not the theoretically ideal piece of silicon given current software? And also how do I then reconfigure the software around the constraints of the available silicon? And so the kind of the, a lot of the commentary there I find to be very static as opposed to just thinking about the natural supply and demand of these things. So I'm wildly bullish. That thesis multicoin has, I believe, three positions now in that thesis, one of which is liquid, which is render, and the other two which are private and unannounced and not yet liquid. So we're excited they are looking at more stuff there. But I'd say the other area that's been coming up a good bit frequently recently is this theory of AI agents having kind of wallets.
00:22:14.640 - 00:22:54.522, Speaker B: And there's a lot of instantiations of this theory. One is like you're playing an MMO and there's all these NPC's and those NPC's are actually LLMs and like they are participating in the economy in a real way. And so like they need to have some sort of wallet system that interacts with, with everything else. Another version of this is like you have your AI agent and you ask it to go do a thing for you and it needs to be able to buy things on your behalf. The, the former can happen if there are MMO developers who try and will that into existence, and those people can theoretically choose to do that today. Obviously folks like Eve Online and Star Atlas. And there's one other one I saw at Solana games day recently.
00:22:54.522 - 00:23:21.354, Speaker B: I'm blanking on the name, I think it was rising sun or something. But a lot of these space fearing MMO type games can choose to implement that. There's no external dependencies. You're building the game, so you kind of choose the rules of the game and how it works so that for sure will happen at some point. Unclear when. I mean, that could still be three years away for all we know, but for sure will happen. The more interesting one is the kind of the AI agent one that represents you and goes and does stuff for you.
00:23:21.354 - 00:24:00.288, Speaker B: And I've been thinking a lot about this one, and I understand why crypto people like this theory. I actually don't think it works, though, but not for technical reasons, but for social construction reasons. I mean, if you think about the Internet today, the vast majority of the Internet is open and free in the sense of like, you go to a webpage and you can look at the webpage and stuff, and like, you can go to the search engine. You can search the very sophisticated search engine, whether it's Google in very general purpose terms or whether it's kayak or Tripadvisor or all trails or whatever. But like, search is free on the Internet because everyone understands there's some sort of downstream intent from search.
00:24:00.416 - 00:24:00.900, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:00.992 - 00:25:08.514, Speaker B: So you can assume your AI agent is a much better searcher than you are and can piece together 510 50 different other search engines and, you know, whatever. I accurate all the information and synthesize it and recursively do whatever it needs to do on your behalf. All of those things are free. If it needs to book something for you, like, let's say it needs to book a trip for you or buy something selling all of the Internet, we need to reconfigure, you know, like assume there's like a very aggressive ramp over the next, like, I don't know, six years from 0% AI agent intermediated commerce to 100%. But like, when you're going from 0% to 3%, like, all of those merchants are very clearly going to say, like, okay, and stripe obviously will be like, hey, here's a way for the bots to call using credit cards to pay for things using the existing rails, right? And you'll type in your credit card number into your LLM and it'll just do that for you. So I generally think that that's the way this will play out. The other way to think about this is like, assume you have some networks of like, very sophisticated sector specific LLMs.
00:25:08.514 - 00:26:38.354, Speaker B: So like, think Bloomberg, LLM medical, LLM legal, LLM, you know, whatever, and assume that, like, those are obviously being developed by their respective companies in those areas. Those companies are obviously going to offer their own LLM AI agent things on a standalone basis. As soon as they feel comfortable doing so, they are presumably going to put those things behind paywalls for their respective verticals for whatever they are, that's fine. And, well, and maybe they have a freemium version where it's, you get three searches per day and they'll have whatever business model they have, but then they're also going to have clearly the paid version. And I pretty if you are a developer at Bloomberg who's doing this and you want the Bloomberg LLM to plug into your OS level LLM, which kind of feels like the natural place, like iOS and Mac and whatever else are clearly going to do this, like, I'm assuming there's going to be a thing that's like hook up your API key from Bloomberg and throw it in chat GPT or apple or whatever, and you already see this now, like when you want to hook up your chat GPT to other third party things, you just like, take the API key and throw it in. So it just like, the model of how to deal with this problem is already out there and maps to all of the existing social norms, security norms, and billing norms that exist and moving all of that to crypto rails. While it sounds nice, and obviously I'm biased and would like it to happen, I just don't see how you're going to overcome all of that inertia in practice.
00:26:38.354 - 00:26:54.790, Speaker B: I want it to happen. It will definitely happen within the confines of crypto native mmos. That seems very obvious. But for you and me doing our AI agent thing, doing our tasks for us on the Internet, that I'm quite skeptical.
00:26:54.982 - 00:27:12.654, Speaker C: Do you feel that your solution solves the problem that search engines like Google have, where if you've got AI bots running around, they're not going to be clicking on adverts and it sort of does away with a lot of that web two revenue source. So do you think maybe having a paywall is what we're going to see?
00:27:13.394 - 00:27:48.774, Speaker B: I don't see why AI agents don't click on ads. Like, the AI agents will hit Google and they will hit kayak and they'll hit Yelp and open tape. I mean, they'll hit all of the search engines and those things. Yeah, it's not going to be scraping HTML on the screen, but they're just going to be having APIs, returning a list of ten links with whatever metadata and develop people who want to be found will pay to be inserted at the top. JSON like, I don't know that. That seems kind of reasonable to me. The theory that ads are bad is, like, wrong.
00:27:48.774 - 00:28:36.388, Speaker B: There are bad elements of ads, but ads are without question net good because they actually act as a form of discovery. And ads allow a new guy who doesn't have SEO to be discovered. And like, telling your AI agent like, you need to go click into like, link number 5000 on the Google search to like, find the new thing is dumb. If the guy who otherwise would rank number 5000 in SEO pays for an ad and then the AI like, hits it because it's in the top five slots, like, that's, that's good. Well, or I should say it can be good, but like, it fundamentally enables discovery, um, and allows capitalism to, to function. So I don't, yeah, I don't, I don't buy this theory that ads don't work, that ad economics will change. They probably change net negative for Google relative to the status quo.
00:28:36.388 - 00:28:50.924, Speaker B: There's something about human visual spatial perception that is different than bot running through JSON. I agree with that. But bot cannot run through, uh, like, it's not going to make 10,000 HTTP requests to, like, other servers.
00:28:55.784 - 00:29:15.672, Speaker A: What about like crypto, cryptographic primitives? Whether it's just the cryptography side, on the ZK side for helping training models with private data, or just even the economic value of like tokens or nfts, like, do you see those playing a role? As things get more driven by AI and AI generated content becomes a thing and more bot traffic happens on the.
00:29:15.688 - 00:29:30.236, Speaker B: Internet, I see this kind of frame thrown around, which implies that once we all have our respective AI agents, total Internet traffic will multiply by ten x or more. I'm pretty sure that's wrong. Bot traffic is already today the substantial majority of the Internet.
00:29:30.300 - 00:29:30.944, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:32.324 - 00:30:05.824, Speaker B: If you ask your AI agent to go do things for you, it's because you have some sort of intent. So either you would have done it yourself, or because the amount of time would have taken is high and asking the AI agent takes 4 seconds. You now increase total Internet consumption like it's just an arbitrage in your own time. So those bot requests will increase versus humans. I think that's right. But I'm skeptical that the relative ratios are particularly large relative to the status quo. Bots are already most of the Internet.
00:30:05.824 - 00:31:05.326, Speaker B: So I just think it's important to note that the total nature of Sybil and bots on the Internet, I don't think that math is changing in a very strong way in aggregate, at least not within a three to five year horizon. I mean, look, in 15 years, like, who knows? But in the near ish term, I'm skeptical in terms of like other, I mean, again like this got the world coin theory is like, you can prove who you are on the Internet, that you're a human. There seems to be this, like, very anti bot narrative emerging, obviously led by Twitter, here being the most aggressive, and then to a lesser extent, by all content providers on the Internet, the Reddits, the shutterstocks, the AP news of the world and stuff. I generally am confused. Like, you want bots to scrape your website, because that's fundamentally discovery. Now, if people are retaking your content without attribution, I think that's a problem. But so long as there's attribution, I think that's net good.
00:31:05.326 - 00:31:40.614, Speaker B: Obviously, Chad GBT V, one doesn't do attribution, but they're not stupid. They're working on it. Anthropic, I believe now with Claude supports attribution, and a lot of other people are working on attribution, so it doesn't seem intractable. And so, like, once you get to the point where, you know, you're pretty confident in attribution, to me, this is all just Google again. Like, it's fair use of, you know, taking text out of whatever the website is and rendering it with, with the link back. Like, we actually have all of the counterfactuals of this experiment as well. If you follow strateckery, he's covered this.
00:31:40.614 - 00:32:26.058, Speaker B: Over the last four or five years, there's been a handful of countries, I think Spain was one, I think Australia was one, Canada may have been one more recently, where the government's Google evil, stealing revenue from the publishers and newspapers and stuff bad. And they have all made the exact. And they go to Google, they're like, Google, you have to pay back a percentage of the ads of those searches back to the publishers or whatever. And Google says no. And then they say, if you want us to stop indexing you, we can stop indexing you, and you won't appear in our search results. And every time this has happened two or three times now, within 48 hours, all of the news publishers are like, oh, my God, like, no, no, no, we'll play by your rules, because all their traffic goes away. And so it's like, okay, we know what the counterfactual is to this experiment.
00:32:26.058 - 00:32:57.964, Speaker B: It's been run at fairly large scale across multiple cultures. So I don't really have a problem. I don't think bots are a problem. The human attribution thing is most interesting for, like, verifying a piece of content is in fact, a person. Also, potentially, it can improve efficiency in the server of, like, instead of a bunch of bots playing dumb games, of like scraping HTML. If like, you know, it's a person, you can show the HTML and if it's not a person, just give them a JSON feed. Like you can weirdly, like maybe, maybe that's net more server and bandwidth efficient than not.
00:32:57.964 - 00:33:14.304, Speaker B: I don't know. But like, I'm skeptical that like, the Internet's so broken and we, oh, if only we have this way to fix it and I'll be better now I'm like, no, like, it works. And, you know, we can continue to make small tweaks and adjust total kind of traffic and processing flows over time.
00:33:14.724 - 00:33:42.838, Speaker A: Right, right. It just reminds me of when that infamous day when Fortnite turned on bots and the game was never the same, just felt so desolate. And they did it to increase engagement because people were winning more games when they killed bots, because they could modulate the bots intelligence based on how good the player was, based on how many games they've won, and so on and so forth. So I guess maybe the fear just comes from that meta being possible now with the rise of AI and the Internet.
00:33:42.926 - 00:33:58.274, Speaker B: Obviously epic thought very hard about this and figuring out how to make it, you know, work or not. Obviously that's their prerogative to do so, but that's, you can just leave Fortnite and go to the next one that doesn't have the bots, you know, like capitalism will naturally solve that problem. So that, that doesn't really concern me.
00:34:02.894 - 00:35:03.834, Speaker C: I really love how multicore you've been writing basically your theses since maybe 2016, 2017. And it's, it's, it's quite brave of you guys because anyone can go back and look at what you were saying when no one really knew what this crypto thing was going to be useful and pick holes in it. But I was reading one that you did two years ago, and it was basically looking at Solana and Ethereum, and it was talking about basically that the technical scalability on Ethereum was confusing and it was likely to break the social scalability, as you referred to it, that you won't be able to pull everyone in the same direction, maybe because we don't really know how it's scaling and when it scales, it's all going to be a bit fragmented. And actually, in that post you theorized that if Coinbase were going to try and bring its users into defi, it would be more likely to do so on Solana than Ethereum, which ironically has been disproven recently with base. So I was just wondering how you feel about that thesis and how you feel about base launching on Ethereum? Two?
00:35:04.374 - 00:35:58.154, Speaker B: Yes, again, well, so I say my general thesis feels mostly vindicated over the last two years, which is like Ethereum is. No one really knows how it's scaling. And if you go really talk to the people building the systems, espresso, optimism, arbitrum, caldera, conduit, you know, suave all these things, like, and sit down with any of these guys in private, uh, and be like, so, like, how does an app work in 24 months? Like, they'll all be like, I don't know, man. Cause, like, they. They understand that there's too much intertwined complexity across too many things. So I think that part of my thesis I was pretty right about, and that is natural, because we are breaking the logical centralization of the system. Previously, there was just one shard, and everyone read and write from one place with one set of rules and norms and standards, and now you're just breaking that up into dozens, if not hundreds of places.
00:35:58.154 - 00:36:30.590, Speaker B: And so the logical centralization is fundamentally broken now. Doesn't mean you can't make it work. Nothing being attempted here is trying to violate the laws of physics. But there are questions of, like, can you get all of the social norms and systems to work together in the new technical configuration? And that is really not clear. So I feel pretty right about that. It is funny that I speculated on Coinbase, and it appears I was 100% wrong, but actually, I think it's too early to call there. There's this view of, oh, Coinbase is going to bring us all the users on chain.
00:36:30.590 - 00:37:11.996, Speaker B: They have 100 million registered users, and they're like, okay, but, like, if they all go on arbitrum or whatever, sorry, base, like, the gas fees are going to spike. It's unclear what exactly Coinbase is going to do to funnel traffic over. I'm assuming they're not going to just, like, go binary in some sort of white to black or black to white situation. They're presumably going to do it in some sort of gradient and a b test kind of whatever, see how things work. But, like, base is a single threaded EVM processor. I don't think arbitrum runs it more than, excuse me, op stack runs at more than a few hundred tps. In the optimistic case, actually, we try to look at world Coin this past week because optimism literally tweeted.
00:37:11.996 - 00:37:46.296, Speaker B: They're like, because of world's coin, gas prices are going up, which I found to be very funny as the scalability solution. So we could look, given that the, I believe base is literally the op stack with a config file has changed. I think they've confirmed that. So we should be able to look at that data from the last few weeks and make pretty high conviction statements about what base will support. I can say with a high degree of confidence the mandate of base is not get all of Coinbase's users onto this thing as much as possible and kill the centralized exchange. The mandate is, we think decentralization is a big part of the future. Let's figure it out.
00:37:46.296 - 00:38:04.204, Speaker B: In order to figure out, we need to be present. We started with Coinbase wallet. We've iterated obviously with Coinbase wallet. Now we need to iterate here. But, like, there is no plan today to support that kind of usage. I mean, because that's not even something Coinbase is solving. Like, that's arbitrary and optimism.
00:38:04.204 - 00:38:38.922, Speaker B: Have to deal with those problems. And I don't think they can describe to you how certainly any individual op chain will get you there. I guess their view is like, the super chain thing will get you there. Seems to be kind of the new meta. The super chain, ironically, is just Solana, but with worse fee market structure and much higher and more complicated interconnection and latency. We've broken logical centralization, and super chain is trying to reconfigure logical centralization, but doing it when they're being like, well, it's open source and you can fork it and do whatever you want. But then if we're going to have the super chain and have logical centralization, then we need to have a set of norms and rules and whatever.
00:38:38.922 - 00:39:15.838, Speaker B: So you have to opt in that via governance, and then you can't make all the changes you want, and it's just kind of like you got two sides of the same. It's like, okay, man, what is this? Look, I don't want to render judgment too harshly here, because, like, none of that, what I just described, exists in the wild. So I'm to some degree speculating as to what I think it will look like based on, you know, what I've seen, but it just certainly feels, like, confused. And again, there's still not a real path to getting, like, large volume. You can get to larger volume than exists on ethel one, but that is not particularly large in the grand scheme of things.
00:39:15.976 - 00:39:44.338, Speaker A: You mentioned the meta right now, or one of them at least, is the super chain thesis, which is the opposite of maybe the monolithic approach, or whatever you want to call Solana. Do you see merit in super chain or app chains. And on the flip side, do you see any other emerging single state chains, like what's happening in the movie ecosystem? Or even souped up evm, so to speak, like Monad, what are your thoughts on the current landscape?
00:39:44.506 - 00:39:59.066, Speaker B: Yeah, lots of thoughts here. And actually, I have a blog post that should be coming pretty soon. Nice. I've been working on it on and off for six months, and I think I finally got it right. I got the frame right. So comment a, the correct term is not monolithic. The correct term you're looking for is integrated.
00:39:59.066 - 00:40:32.768, Speaker B: There's been a long history in technology about what should be integrated versus not. This is played out in cpu design, in like coupling hardware and cpu and graphics cards and memory. This is played out in operating systems and applications. This is played out so many times, the browser bundling with the OS. I mean, dude, this debates happened a lot. And now every instantiation of this debate has had different technical trade offs and different commercial trade offs and different market structures. So there's no universal way to therefore project forward.
00:40:32.768 - 00:41:26.642, Speaker B: And also in the context of specific things, those trade offs, what should be integrated versus modular, has changed when there's been interesting technical breakthroughs, the iPhone being the most interesting one of reintegrating lots of things. So I'm not trying to say there is a right or wrong answer to the question, other than to recognize the way that crypto tends to be pretty young and also even age adjusted. Pretty poorly read on the history of software and hardware over the last 40 years. And when you really appreciate the history, you can zoom out and understand, okay, this is not as binary as being presented, and certainly the term monolith just implies lack of flexibility, lack of agility. And the opposite is the case. Apple moves way faster than Google because they're integrated specifically with regards to iPhone and iOS. Kind of.
00:41:26.642 - 00:42:05.094, Speaker B: Comment a, comment b, the super chain is actually like a, to some degree a rejection of the modular thesis. Again, I don't think that's. I was just talking about this a few minutes ago in the last question. But, like, if you're telling everyone, yeah, you can have an op stack, but everyone's got to, if you want to have the super chain work, then we all have to agree to the same rules and laws and norms and everything. Then, like, what? What did you do to modular? Like, you, by definition, haven't done anything. Um, and so now you just have shittier Solana. Like, Solana fee markets are granular to the correct level, which is per piece of state that is being touched, which, when you think about reverse principles is obviously the correct way to handle fee markets.
00:42:05.094 - 00:42:49.134, Speaker B: And in the super chain construction, it would be per op stack instance, which is way less granular than per piece of state being touched. And then, secondly, then you have the bridge problem and the latency and what's atomic and what's not. And do the query providers know? And like there's just a bunch of weird questions that emerge in just dealing with like knowing which other pieces of, of the op chain to go hit and how to hit them and whatever. I don't say those problems can't be solved, but just like that is very complicated. And in Solana you just call the piece of state you want and you just get it back. And so, and you get it instantly for free or very near free. So that to me is like a weird implicit rejection of the, the thing that they seem to be building.
00:42:49.134 - 00:43:15.814, Speaker B: Again, you got to take everything I just said with some grain of salt because like it's not in the wild yet. But like if you project what we know, this is just confusing. Third thing I'd say is part of the question, I guess you comment asked about move chains. You know, the, there's a lot of interesting stuff happening there. Certainly in gaming world that seems to be where move is getting the most traction. Both Aptos and Sue have been fairly aggressive there. None of the games have launched.
00:43:15.814 - 00:43:45.642, Speaker B: So I can't say if they're going to work or not or how good those games will be or whatever, but they seem to be getting real traction going there. I actually like that as the right go to market. Ethereum had Defi come first, which is weird. Financial markets happen after there's other commerce. And this is very obviously true because human commerce worked before financial markets existed. Obviously. We kind of started with the Medici family in Florence in the 14 hundreds and the Renaissance and stuff.
00:43:45.642 - 00:44:15.210, Speaker B: And then you got to join stock companies and then you got the stock exchanges and whatever, right? But that stuff is mostly post 1800. And obviously we had a lot of commerce prior to 1800. Crypto was the opposite, where financial markets popped up first without organic economic activity. And that happened for a bunch of reasons, one of which is no one knew what to do with the blockchain. And so speculation was the default answer. And two, um, the, like the ethereum couldn't be used for commerce because those too slow and expensive. But if, if you're, if you're paying five or $50, it wouldn't work.
00:44:15.210 - 00:44:52.106, Speaker B: But hey, if you're going to trade 5000 or $10,000 then, like, whatever, you'll pay the fees. And, like, the vast majority of commerce is, like, under the $300 threshold, right, in terms of, like, number of transactions. And so for those very weird, you know, reasons, finance happened first on ethereum without the organic activity, and now people are trying to backfill the organic activity and, you know, we'll see how that works. Aptos kind of doesn't have that luxury because, like, there's already a financial market and they kind of have to get the organic stuff to work first. So I think they're focused on that, which I like. It's very easy to let yourself get lost in these defi circles. And, like, it's all very circular.
00:44:52.106 - 00:45:13.038, Speaker B: It's very fun intellectually. It's obviously, if you're a finance guy, it's like, cool intellectually, but, like, finance is there to serve other markets. Finance is not a fundamentally economically productive market in and of itself. So I like what they're doing, but it's too early to say anything with confidence. There may have been another part of your question I missed.
00:45:13.206 - 00:45:22.954, Speaker A: I just brought up kind of, like, examples that sit in the middle, like Monad, which is kind of souping up the EVM, so to speak, but on their own separate chain with no bridging or anything.
00:45:23.654 - 00:45:51.814, Speaker B: I love Monad. Intellectually, I think it is the. I mean, it is the way to bring Solana to Ethereum is basically what it is, which I think is great. The challenge Monad faces is just the meta. The meta is just going in the opposite direction as them. Solana was obviously going in the opposite direction as Ethereum from day one and still is now. But the difference was, they were building their own tech stack and their own apps and developer tools and whatever, and virtual machine and stuff.
00:45:51.814 - 00:46:20.318, Speaker B: By having that hard line, it kind of forced people to, like, self select pretty clearly. And I'm just, I'm concerned with Monad. Like, I'm confident the tech will be good. We know Keone and the team, we've spent some time with them. Uh, my my concern is, like, because you're EVM, you just, you get, like, all of the code is not being written for Monad. It's being written for arbitrage, optimism, and Ethel, one, which don't have parallelism and, like, are still optimizing around a very different set of gas constraints and usage patterns. No one is building a c lob on arbitram or optimism because.
00:46:20.318 - 00:47:12.788, Speaker B: Cause it doesn't make sense. You can't have a single threaded c lob for many markets. Like, maybe you can get away with a single threaded c lob for a market, like, let's say ETh USD, but, like, then taking 50 markets and having all of those run serially, like, is just not going to work in a c lob. And, like, Keone's from jump, and he's like, very clearly he's like, I'm going to build the c lob on EVM, which is great, and, like, I'm supportive of that, and that should exist, but, like, that doesn't map. Like, you can argue that almost every decision made in every Ethereum contract written today is assuming a c lob is impossible and optimizing around some sort of amm liquidity pool thing. There's versions of this with avian compound and with synthetics, and there's different incarnations of it, but, like, all of them basically reject the notion of limit order price discovery, and that kind of manifests in everything you see on chain there. So they're fighting the meta of the tool chain that they're using.
00:47:12.788 - 00:47:39.564, Speaker B: Using. And, like, that's the concern is, like, I love the vision. It's just a very weird instantiation. And unfortunately, history is path dependent. So, like, if Monad had launched five years ago, I think it would do better than if it launches today, because the meta has now been pretty firmly set around scaling via single threaded processor, which I hate, but, I mean, that's just what the meta has been set at, so that's out of my control.
00:47:39.644 - 00:48:07.286, Speaker C: Raoul, looking forward about what you're excited about in the market, I once heard you say that you think most good tech investments are controversial, contrarian, and weird. I feel like there's this big design space partly helped by chains like Solana, where suddenly a lot more is possible. So I don't know. Have you found any weird, unusual things which initially might be laughed at, but may well become some of the new metas?
00:48:07.430 - 00:48:25.434, Speaker B: I think so. I mean, I would argue Filecoin is laughed out by most of crypto. There's like a filecoin cohort within crypto that takes it very seriously. But I think most of crypto looks at it, and they're like, I don't know, man. It's like s three, but slower, and they just kind of stop. That's as far as they get. So I'm pretty excited there.
00:48:25.434 - 00:49:22.574, Speaker B: I'd say another area that I'm pretty intrigued by is fully homomorphic encryption. Like all advanced cryptography, it has been 20 years away for 20 years, and so maybe now's the time I don't know. But Multicoren has recently made a couple of investments in that area. I can't say what the companies are, but we've done two. I have come to the view with a pretty high degree of conviction that, broadly speaking, if you want to enable on chain privacy, the correct cryptographic primitive is fhe, not ZK. Don't interpret that in a too simple or binary of a way. For example, if you are like saying, if you want to prove this is me, and my driver's license says I'm 21, like, that's what ZK is for kind of a thing, very explicitly, but like, more like, I want to do this trade and not, no one's gonna see my trade, and that kind of a thing that roughly maps substantially better to fhe than it does to ZK.
00:49:22.574 - 00:49:27.374, Speaker B: And I think fhe is the primary thing that will unlock all of that.
00:49:27.494 - 00:49:30.494, Speaker C: Can you just describe what fhe is?
00:49:30.574 - 00:49:50.784, Speaker B: Yeah. So fhe stands for fully homomorphic encryption. It means computing over encrypted data. Fhe is the holy grail of cryptography. If you kind of think about like, okay, you can encrypt data, you can send data to someone. If they have the key, they can decrypt it. Obviously, that's kind of how most communications happen on the Internet today is in that model.
00:49:50.784 - 00:51:05.464, Speaker B: But then if you send someone the data, and then let's say it's a server like Facebook or Google or whatever, and then if you need them to do anything on the data for you, whether that's Photoshop, you want them to edit the image or edit the document in Google Docs or whatever, that all requires you to see the content in order to make the adjustment to the content. And so that means all of those cloud services that do those things have to decrypt the data first before they can apply any changes. Fhe allows you, in theory, that you send the data encrypted to the server. The server cannot read the data, but they can say, like, you know, change this pixel from blue to green or whatever, and they can do that without knowing. And they'll know that they changed the pixel from blue to green, but they won't know anything else in the content of the image that was sent to them from the beginning, which I think is really powerful. So for anything like all this talk about OpenAI and businesses being reluctant to use it because they're concerned OpenAI is going to get all of these businesses data, and it's going to be all sensitive and stuff, this is what fhe is for is like, this is you can send all this data in. Now, the problem with Fhe is it's extraordinarily computationally intensive.
00:51:05.464 - 00:51:45.914, Speaker B: The overhead incurred in doing so is, generally speaking, higher than doing ZK. It's felt further away. There's been a lot of breakthroughs recently that I think will unlock this, and then I think it will be coupled with hardware acceleration, and I think you'll get this to be usable a lot sooner than people think. So I'm pretty excited about fhe for actually unlocking privacy. The other thing I would say is, for ZK is like. Like, what is a zero knowledge proof? It's okay, I take input and I produce computation of it, and then send the proof to the chain, right? That's basically how these things work. This really doesn't lend itself to defi.
00:51:45.914 - 00:52:23.270, Speaker B: In order for Defi to work on chain, you need to have a top down view of the system. So, like, if it's uniswap, you need to have like, know how much x and how much y is in there and what k is. So you can adjust the price and have it move up and down. If it's Aave, you need to know what the collateral values are, so you can do liquidations and like health factors and all that stuff, right? So you need a top down view of the system. Now, let's consider zcash, which is like the simplest Zk thing out there, uh, or for. For our purposes. And like, what does the zcash proof say? Whenever you send the private zcash transaction? The proof basically says there are some series of inputs that have been sent, excuse me, some series of Utxos that.
00:52:23.270 - 00:52:52.410, Speaker B: That I have not yet spent that have been sent to my secret addresses in the encrypted blob, such that the amount of transactions such that the amount of Utxos I'm currently sending are less than the amount that I have. That's like roughly what the proof says in kind of english terms. If all of those proofs are perfectly valid, then you can assume that, like, the 21 million number is intact. I think Zcash is still on 21 million. I actually don't know. I'm assuming it's on 21 million. And they may have modified it because they did fork bitcoin originally.
00:52:52.410 - 00:53:31.524, Speaker B: The problem with that view is that, like, there is no top down view of how many zcash are there in the encrypted pool. And in fact, there was a bug that came out about two or three years ago, maybe three or four years ago that was like, oh my God. If this bug had been exploited, someone could have minted an unlimited amount of zcash in the encrypted pool. Which is a testament to exactly this problem that there is no sort of top down, auditable view. You're assuming that every proof is valid, and obviously the point of the zero notch proofs is that they're valid and that anyone can verify them. But if there's a core logical bug in the system to begin with, then you get this problem. So the challenge with ZK for DeFi is that you break the top down view of the system, which is just kind of described in the context of Zcash.
00:53:31.524 - 00:54:24.926, Speaker B: All of the people you see darkfy, you see alio, you see aztec, you see all these guys trying to figure out how to do ZKDFI in different ways. And they're all dealing with this fundamental problem of there's no top down view of the system because everyone is producing a proof saying, I'm not going to tell you what I did, you being like the chain as a whole and kind of the top down God that can review everything. And so it's just like, kind of doesn't work. Now, hey, look, maybe I'm proven wrong and these guys figure out this magic, but like asking developers to then reason through this form of logic where it's like, oh, yeah, yeah, I don't really know what the system is. And like, we can make the math work and the law, it's just super difficult. The beauty of fhe is you can like, just all the data is there and you can just compute over it. Like, the core logic of the system stays the same, right.
00:54:24.926 - 00:54:54.806, Speaker B: But you just can't see what's happening. And so to me, that kind of just maps much better to defy than the ZK approach. But very importantly, it allows developers to reason about the system as everyone already currently reasons about all of these systems and doesn't require everyone trying to figure out the new set of core reasoning principles of how to think about is it collateralized, is it not? What's happening here? Those are very important questions in financial markets.
00:54:54.910 - 00:55:37.112, Speaker A: Totally. This is definitely a rabbit hole I'm going to dive into because I'm just less familiar with what's happening on the fe front. One closing topic or question I wanted to bring up while we have you on is now people are calling it spatial computing, but Bradley, it's been the metaverse meme. You wrote about it late 2021, and now in the last couple of months, Apple put out the headset or they announced it rather, coming out next year. What are your views on the metaverse? And specifically, I know you mentioned in the blog that crypto could be a substrate for it. Have those views changed now that Apple, which is famously not really integrating crypto at all into their products and so integrated to our earlier conversation, seems like they're going to lead the charge on adoption?
00:55:37.268 - 00:56:14.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Apple's views around crypto will change. Right now, Apple's views are anti crypto, mostly because they just want to extract the tax on digital transactions. I think governments are going to not let them do that. EU has already basically made that. I believe that goes into effect. I believe in 2024 in the EU or some version of it, and then I think other markets will follow. I think once Apple accepts, like, hey, we can't tax all digital commerce, then I think crypto becomes more strategy aligned for them as a strategic fuck you to Apple, to Google and Facebook and all of the other companies who are fundamentally aggregate consumer data in the cloud companies.
00:56:14.844 - 00:56:44.084, Speaker B: So I think that's which will happen. It'll be fairly binary, and when it happens, it'll be pretty stark. I don't know when that'll happen. It could be in a year, it could be in seven years. I don't know. So it's kind of comment a, comment b here is Apple Vision Pro is a very different product than Oculus Apple Vision Pro is trying to do. I wrote a Twitter thread about this 20 minutes after the keynote a couple months ago.
00:56:44.084 - 00:57:24.230, Speaker B: Apple calls it spatial computing. It's really actually not spatial computing, which is the irony of it. It's just the best desktop monitor you could have ever imagined. Correct version of it. And what Apple has that Facebook doesn't have is they have incredible amounts of desktop software that are written for the Mac. And so they're prioritizing backwards compatibility for all of that stuff and creating those environments so that architects and designers and maybe developers and mountain video game designers, whatever, there's going to be certain classes of job that love this work environment, and obviously all of the stuff they already use will naturally flow into it very well. The other extreme they're leaning into is entertainment and gaming.
00:57:24.230 - 00:58:04.882, Speaker B: And obviously Facebook has tried that with gaming on the oculus. This thing is a lot higher powered than anything Facebook has produced. So we'll see if they can produce compelling gaming experiences, and then we'll see if they can produce compelling content experiences by just like being Apple and getting Disney to do stuff and getting the NBA to do stuff. It seems like they are going to have pretty compelling content experiences. So they're approaching this from two directions, top down. But, like, everything they're doing is focused on extremely high fidelity compute interactions that actually aren't really taking advantage of the spatial stuff. When I think about spatial, I think of the magic leap demo of the elephant jumps out of the table kind of a thing.
00:58:05.018 - 00:58:06.058, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:58:06.226 - 00:58:27.368, Speaker B: That's not useful for anything, but it's certainly very cool. And I remember the first time I saw the magic leak demo, my brain kind of exploded. But Apple seems to be focusing not on that, which is fine. I think they have an intention of moving towards that. They're obviously coining the moniker now with spatial computing, and I suspect they're going to. They plan to stick with that moniker for ten years or longer. But Facebook, on the other hand, is actually going for fairly low fidelity.
00:58:27.368 - 00:59:13.530, Speaker B: If you look at Horizon worlds, right, and it's not that it's, like, blocky, but it's just, like, clearly not super high fidelity. And so, like, a classic kind of question in video game design for the last. This has really become a thing in the last eight or so years as the graphics kind of have hit the. The top of the asymptote is what's called the uncanny valley, which is like, if a human digital object looks like 98% as good as a human, or I should say, and moves 98% as good as a human, it actually is like, throws you off, and you're like, no, no, no, there's something wrong. Yeah, but if it's 70% as good as a human, then you're like, yes, I understand. It's, like, not a human. And so apple seems to think that they have crossed the uncanny valley kind of loosely.
00:59:13.530 - 00:59:44.754, Speaker B: And I'll take it for granted that they have, because they have all of the right engineering teams of the world to understand this. At a physics level, biological level, human interaction design is what apple specializes, and they're the best of the world at it. So I'm taking it for granted that they have crossed the uncanny valley, and obviously, they're not 100% real, but maybe it's 99.99, and maybe it's like, okay, well, you can't tell the difference anymore. Good enough. So they're very different approaches. I don't think of it as bad for the metaverse or whatever.
00:59:44.754 - 01:00:07.968, Speaker B: I just think about it as different. I still tend to believe that Apple will, when all is said and done, will come down on the side of crypto, mostly as a strategic fuck you to their primary competitors, all of whom their businesses rely on aggregating consumer data in the cloud. And Apple is based on selling fancy hardware, so I think they'll. They'll make the switch.
01:00:08.136 - 01:00:37.846, Speaker A: That makes sense. I think it reminds me a lot of when the iPhone first came out and, like, they had literally an app called iPod so that you knew how to, like, use the iPhone, and over time, you know, Spotify and these kind of mobile native experiences flourish. And FaceTime, I think, is another killer app that people saw in Star Trek and then realized, I think those types of apps that actually leverage spatial compute will emerge over time. And we're in this weird transition period where they're emphasizing kind of like, you know, this is a gigantic monitor that connects to your Mac, basically, and things like that.
01:00:37.960 - 01:00:39.386, Speaker B: Yep, that's right.
01:00:39.530 - 01:00:52.090, Speaker A: Well, awesome. We covered a lot of stuff, obviously, a lot to think on, but always, always appreciate your thought leadership and seeing you on Twitter, putting out your visions for the future. And, yeah, it's been a great conversation, guys.
01:00:52.122 - 01:00:58.218, Speaker B: This is fun. We covered a lot of ground, a lot of cool ideas I don't think I've talked about before. So, saddle, I got to lay it out with you all for the first time.
01:00:58.306 - 01:00:59.618, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Love to hear it.
01:00:59.666 - 01:01:03.406, Speaker B: All right, guys, thanks. Thanks for having me on. Was awesome. Look forward to seeing this thing out in the wild.
01:01:03.530 - 01:01:04.574, Speaker A: Likewise. Thanks, Kyle.
