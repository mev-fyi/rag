00:00:13.560 - 00:00:33.876, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered. I'm your host, Saul, along with Dave here. And today it's just us. We're keeping it casual. We're taking a bit of a breather in the midst of all this chaos that's happening in crypto markets, specifically on Solana, but pretty much everywhere. And we're going to talk about just a few topics that seem relevant today. We're going to talk about meme coins.
00:00:33.876 - 00:00:59.382, Speaker A: We're going to talk about the saga phone, which I think both of us have been using a lot. The points meta that has just invaded every protocol to this day. We have a lot of thoughts and rabbit holes you want to get into on all those fronts, whatever else comes to mind. But, yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of. Of where we'll start things. Dave, I don't know if you have anything else to add to this. You want to keep it more conversational and.
00:00:59.382 - 00:01:02.994, Speaker A: Yeah, just kind of get your feel on the pulse of what's happening.
00:01:03.854 - 00:01:43.352, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think just nice, casual conversation catching up. And I think we are talking now at a very exciting time in Solana's history, probably with the upcoming Jupiter airdrop with meme coins going absolutely mental on Solana and really, I would say, leading the crypto market at the moment. I think Solana meme coins are the meta at the moment. And, I mean, that's a first, isn't it? We haven't really seen maybe like, nfts at the end of last bull market, but we haven't really seen Solana leading the whole industry, really, for a while. So it's unusual. It's exciting.
00:01:43.352 - 00:01:44.124, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:44.424 - 00:02:06.582, Speaker A: If you look at the top meme coins by market cap bonk is three at about 800 million. Dog. Dog with hat, 400 million. Now, people are calling for that to flip bonk. And then if you keep going down, unless actually Myro, which is another Solana 1200 million. Very interesting. You go two more down or three more down.
00:02:06.582 - 00:02:37.242, Speaker A: Silly dragons, another Solana one. Right. The point is, and all these charts have gone up in the last seven days and all the other chains gone down or flat. That is wild to me. And that probably hints at what's to come once retail really gets embedded in this. I mean, every day or every week, it seems like there's another meme coin on Solana specifically that pops off, that kind of encapsulates pop culture of the day. Flavor of the day win is a big one, right.
00:02:37.242 - 00:03:00.654, Speaker A: With the Drake meme when he was on twitch or whatever. I need a win. Max win. Or whatever. That one I saw pop up like a couple weeks ago and now it's had a massive run up. I see a world where people kind of flex how in tune they are with pop culture by making bets on tickers like this. And that is not stupid.
00:03:00.654 - 00:03:17.434, Speaker A: I think that's actually pretty fun for a lot of people. And you can only do this on Solana just because of how cheap it is to launch meme coins to trade them at small size. People don't want to allocate ten k into this stuff and pay 100 in gas. But curious on your thoughts with all that.
00:03:18.614 - 00:04:10.596, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree with that. Because I keep asking myself, is this the same as we've seen before, or is this something completely new? Because it doesn't feel like before the previous bull market on ETH, you had Shiba Inu and it was costing you $50 a transaction. It was just focused, really, on two tokens during the whole bull market. This does feel completely net new, and as you say, it does feel far more current. And it's almost like the next generation of people thought it would be social tokens and social applications. And maybe this is the sort of crypto native social interaction which is buying meme coins on Solana and then shilling your bags on Twitter. Basically, because we've often talked about if you can do a social application on crypto, you need the distribution of one of these big sites.
00:04:10.596 - 00:04:30.026, Speaker B: There's no point trying to start from naught, really. I mean, it's such an uphill task, so you might as well leverage what you've already got. And basically we're leveraging Twitter and then interacting some sort of degen trading element to it. And that's what this feels like to me. So I completely agree.
00:04:30.130 - 00:04:59.372, Speaker A: You're essentially financializing attention. Meme coins get attention. They pull people into crypto rails, and then once they're on those rails, you can sort of get them to do other things, too. Now, the best example of this is the saga phone. Literally, we were talking to Stephen, who essentially created the phone, lead engineer at labs for the phone, Solana Labs. This was what, in May? We talked to him in May. The phone struggled with sales.
00:04:59.372 - 00:05:45.314, Speaker A: It went on sale basically two months after it launched for half off. I paid full price for it. I used it sparingly, let's put it that way, and we'll do a full review of this phone. And it's just a second because I have a lot of thoughts on it. But I guess the point I'm trying to make is it wasn't until bonk went up in value and the airdrop on it was essentially worth more than the entry price to the phone that they sold all of them in like a few days or whatever. Then people started using this thing and they're like, hey, this is actually kind of cool to have essentially like a ledger built in where I could sign transactions with my fingerprint, and it's very secure. App developers came in to this gold rush access protocols from the first, do a big airdrop that's almost the same amount as bonk at this point in us dollar terms.
00:05:45.314 - 00:06:15.174, Speaker A: Now everyone has a saga strategy. It seems like they're all trying to make mobile apps, whether it's for this phone or an experience for the next one, that they're going to do that. Pre orders just opened up for this week. But that's another example of this story playing over and over again, where it's not just yelling at people to care about the App Store duopoly. Right? No one cares. But you introduce some fun into the equation through this bonk airdrop, which, yeah, I mean, it happened to go up a lot. The airdrop's been there forever.
00:06:15.174 - 00:06:28.814, Speaker A: Now you get some initial tension. Now they're in the rails. Now you can do the cool stuff with the phone and maybe even attempt to disintermediate that duopoly, which is exciting. And Toli's been tweeting a lot about that.
00:06:30.994 - 00:07:29.700, Speaker B: Yeah, again, I completely agree. And I think that they almost need to remarket it and not say that certainly it was potentially a mistake going high end, because then you are competing with iPhones and things like that. And I think they just almost need to move away from the fact that it is a phone and it just becomes this secure seed storage device, which is also an airdrop machine, effectively. And then you can access apps which you can't necessarily access anywhere else, but just reframe it in a completely different way. And. And that is what is going to get, I think, a potentially critical mass of people to actually buy into this. Because I say if you're almost financializing the purchase of a piece of hardware, then suddenly it doesn't matter the quality, it doesn't matter that it took a few extra weeks to ship and that it's not quite up to the specs of the latest iPhone 16 because you're not getting the airdrops on the iPhone 16.
00:07:29.700 - 00:08:06.114, Speaker B: You're shilling out a grand, if you're lucky, and then however much on your monthly fees. So, yeah, I completely agree. It's almost become, hasn't it? Like a deep in project. And rather than the native token being related to the phone directly, it's almost. The meme coin is using its memetic power to evangelize and promote certain things, which it would like to see progress and help push the crypto thesis forward. It's almost like the next gen of public goods funding, if you like.
00:08:08.014 - 00:08:35.366, Speaker A: I mean, I'm getting this question a lot, like, from people that want to pre order the next one. Should I do it? Should I preorder it? Thoughts on this phone? I have a lot of thoughts. So the way I use it these days is I use it as my kill phone. So for those that are not familiar with kale phone is a second phone that doesn't have any fun apps on it. There's no social media on it, obviously. I don't have a different number on here, right? I'm using helium, so no one knows who I am on this phone. I don't really have any contacts.
00:08:35.366 - 00:09:01.584, Speaker A: There's no distractions through messages. I have a separate telegram that has no contacts in it, so I just use it for testing purposes. I have Uber and that's basically it. Basically the apps you need to survive Uber, Google Maps, nothing else. So the idea is you switch to using this phone if you want to focus throughout the day, go on a walk, not have Instagram or those other fun things. So in that sense, it works. It does its job.
00:09:01.584 - 00:09:34.546, Speaker A: What I'll say is, I think the key thing here is they really need to rethink about how this embedded hardware wallet works for multiple reasons. One, if you have multiple fingerprints on this thing, it makes you use a pin every time. Now, I don't know if it's a bug with mine, I suspect it's not. I suspect that's just how they. They only want to have one fingerprint allow you to sign transactions with that embedded hardware wallet. In that case, I don't think that's an acceptable trade off. I think a lot of people use the phone either hand, depending on if they're busy or not.
00:09:34.546 - 00:10:16.730, Speaker A: And, you know, you don't want to have to switch over and, like, sign it with just that one fingerprint. It seems minor, but it's gotten very annoying where I basically have to enter the pin anytime I want to sign a transaction. And then the other point is that it's modeled too much like these old school meta of just wallets where you're signing five transactions to do a swap. Is that important from a security standpoint? Probably the thing is, though, if you use these things like bonkbot, Unibot, banana gun, I'm so used to now a world where, or even smart contract wallets will do this, where you can bundle a bunch of transactions. I think ETH people call this intent based execution. I don't really like the buzzword. I don't really know what that means.
00:10:16.730 - 00:10:32.040, Speaker A: An intent. It's just an intent. Why do we need to overcomplicate things? I want to buy something. Let me just click one button to buy it. Right. You can't do that with this secure approach on saga. It's very, very cumbersome, and then it actually takes you completely out of the context of the app.
00:10:32.040 - 00:11:21.634, Speaker A: It shows you a completely different pop up, because I think they want to restrict access to what's displayed on the screen. I think Stephen articulated this way better, but it's a security reason why when you sign a transaction, it kind of takes you out of the app and shows you a screen showing you what's going to happen, then you sign it. Point is, it's just, it's a lot of clicking, and in fact, this is slower than desktop, which I didn't think that was possible. I figured a mobile would be faster, but I'm, like, going around claiming these airdrops. And then the final piece to this puzzle, which is hard, is it's probably because no one's put in the time yet, but a lot of these mobile apps, quote unquote mobile apps on Saga in the Dappstore are just, like, skinned browser apps. And, man, that is just the worst of both worlds. Using a web browser on a mobile device that, where you need to connect a wallet is a very painful experience.
00:11:21.634 - 00:11:49.690, Speaker A: And so this is nowhere near ready for primetime. I only am using this because there's a monetary reason to Mon check phone XYZ. Each phone has $1,600 worth of airdrops at this point. Most of it coming from bonk axis protocol and saga monkeys. But they have this combination of tailwinds. Now they have the attention. They have a chance.
00:11:49.690 - 00:12:05.294, Speaker A: They have a second crack at this phone with this new one that's going to be a little bit cheaper. I would optimize almost entirely for the smoothest possible way to securely interact with digital assets, but I don't know. I'll pause there. I don't know if you have any thoughts.
00:12:06.654 - 00:12:27.694, Speaker B: I agree that I don't think I have to enter the pen, but I certainly have to put my fingerprint on the back in awkward position multiple, multiple times. Yeah, yeah. And really, it's this awkward juxtaposition of you're trying to make everything hyper secure, but at the same time, you're trying to let people degen on a hot wallet on a. I mean, it's not hot, but, you know, effectively mobile.
00:12:27.734 - 00:12:29.910, Speaker A: It should feel like a hot wallet, though, which is the point.
00:12:29.982 - 00:12:39.576, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You use your mobile wallets because you want quick access while you're on the loo to your favorite app, so.
00:12:39.720 - 00:12:40.384, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:40.544 - 00:12:59.328, Speaker B: Yeah. Unless they can really, like, smoothen that out. I agree. It's just awkward. And it's two different use cases basically clashing against each other. So I do agree with that. I think the apps improve now that there's 20,000 people and strong potential that there's going to be 100,000 people signing up for.
00:12:59.328 - 00:13:01.484, Speaker B: Do you think. Do you think it'll get to 100,000?
00:13:01.954 - 00:13:32.244, Speaker A: Yeah, that's another question I'm getting, is, like, people are asking if they should preorder the new saga. So the thing is, like, they're. What the Solana team did not do well is match supply and demand. I mean, granted, their. Their batch was only 20,000 phones, right? That's a pretty conservative estimate, and they basically didn't hit it until bonk. The worst thing you could ever do in hardware is have too much inventory that just, you know, it ages very quickly in hardware. It improves so quickly as an industry.
00:13:32.244 - 00:14:03.396, Speaker A: So what they're going to try this time, that's why they're doing the pre orders this way, is match supply and demand. Where does that number land? I think it's definitely more than 20,000 phones, because they sold all those out. And people are just going to now hold this recency bias and assume that the next batch of phones will make them rich. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be the case at all. I think that's an artifact of limited supply. And just the unit bias for bonk was trading so much lower, and so no one's really expecting it to be worth $400. Right.
00:14:03.396 - 00:14:37.824, Speaker A: It was supposed to be worth $20 or something like that. They're positioned in this new phone more as like a. There's a reflink attached to it, there's a leaderboard for, like, getting people to buy it. And then the final piece is, I think, like, madlads, for instance, is doing some sort of a raffle, but it's not, like a guaranteed thing. Right. It's like you have a shot at winning a lad, which, you know, it's gonna be worth 20, 30,000 when it comes out, or more. So it's hard for me to imagine a world where this thing is going to make you more money than the original batch of saga.
00:14:37.824 - 00:14:57.190, Speaker A: That said, it could actually be a really cool experiment to just get people to use, like, a crypto native phone that has that embedded wallet that has the security. It's way more fun than using a ledger. I hate using those. Um, yeah, so I don't know. I mean, that, that's kind of how I see it. Maybe it's 50,000 or so. That's probably my guess.
00:14:57.190 - 00:15:02.510, Speaker A: Um, I don't know about. I don't know, about 100k. It's possible, though. There's just a lot more attention on this now.
00:15:02.702 - 00:15:40.274, Speaker B: I think it's successful if it can receive enough airdrops to pay for everyone's phone again, I think if that becomes the meta of sign up for the phone and it will be free. Um, and, and hopefully you receive more airdrops than it was actually worth. And the other thing is, you can mine mobile, you can mine, I think it's called getgrass. So just from sort of walking around or being connected to the Wi Fi in your house, you can mine things that way as well. And so, I mean, doing the maths, dollar 450, I think, is what they're asking for at the moment, 100,000 phones. So that would be $45 million of airdrops. So if you can get 45 million, it.
00:15:40.274 - 00:16:14.674, Speaker B: I just kind of think, like, the big projects in Solana should almost just like, for example, Jupiter, I think they're now going to be doing an airdrop every January. You know, why don't they just portion a tiny bit of that airdrop? Because it's probably going to be worth a billion dollars every January. Couldn't they just clip off 10 million of that, for example, to go to all of the sagaphones and just sort of get contributions from the big projects? I think something like that. If it just becomes this airdrop machine, then I don't really see how it wouldn't be successful.
00:16:15.574 - 00:16:23.006, Speaker A: Yeah, it just comes out of the motivations. Is it worth it to airdrop someone like us that has his phone? I don't know.
00:16:23.190 - 00:16:33.608, Speaker B: It's about expanding web, three app chains and improving mobile interactions in crypto. It's about pushing that whole side of the industry forward, I suppose.
00:16:33.726 - 00:16:33.956, Speaker A: So.
00:16:33.980 - 00:16:50.876, Speaker B: As I say, as I was mentioning earlier with meme coins, its almost public good funding the next phase of it. So, to me, 45 million. If it launched in 2025, hopefully the bull markets still going on. It sounds highly plausible to me that every phone would get enough airdrop to cover the cost of it.
00:16:50.940 - 00:17:33.523, Speaker A: Well, by the way, what do you think theyre working on? I think theres some rumor going around theres going to be some big feature. Did I miss it? I mean, I thought it was going to be support for another chain like ETH or something, because we alluded to this in the last podcast when we talked about this, is that the code is open sourced to use the secure enclave to interact with the mobile wallet adapter. ETH could conceivably support it. Other chains could support it. Maybe not ETH. Maybe one of these next gen like say, or another one of these parallelized l one s. Do you think that's kind of what they're hinting at? I mean, that could be big actually, because now you're going cross chain on a mobile device, you're getting another ecosystem excited for it.
00:17:33.523 - 00:17:37.043, Speaker A: Maybe it's something else, but curious on your thoughts?
00:17:37.903 - 00:18:00.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that would be the most likely way. And again, it's sort of expanding the ecosystems that you might receive airdrops from. It's almost the trojan horse thing, isn't it? Just sneak them into the city because it's going to be an airdrop device, and then suddenly you've got potentially in a few years like millions of people around the world with a decentralized App Store, and then you can potentially start doing quite powerful things.
00:18:05.374 - 00:18:41.064, Speaker A: I just wanted to make a comment, which is I've been using helium for only nine days now on this phone because I switched over from, I had this phone for so long, I was using Google Fi because there was no helium mobile available for it. So I switched from Google Fi to helium Mobile. Finally, recently in nine days, I made about $9 worth of mobile tokens. Now granted, price is really volatile, but it's not bad. So that kind of tracks out to about $30 a month or so. That's more than the cost of the plan that's compelling. You're essentially getting paid $10 a month to have free service.
00:18:41.064 - 00:19:15.860, Speaker A: Does that sustain? Maybe, maybe not. It feels like it's always going to be cheaper than a plan. So to the extent this thing wants to go mainstream, right, that is an incredibly compelling proposition. That, by the way, you mentioned on this podcast when we chatted with my former boss Alex Thorne of Galaxy, which it was just an idea where we could have a national plan that is cheaper than the incumbents. Now that's possible. With these tokens, people might even be incentivized to hold it because they believe in it so much. That's really compelling.
00:19:15.860 - 00:19:17.544, Speaker A: That's really, really compelling.
00:19:18.084 - 00:20:02.084, Speaker B: Yeah. If you use helium, as you say, it reduces your costs, and if you then mine it from your saga phone, then suddenly not only are you probably getting a free phone from all the airdrops, but also getting free coverage from just mining mobile every month. So yeah, it's the flywheels that we've been talking about for the best part of the year now in deep in that I think are really starting to come to fruition. I think helium is grossly undervalued given the rate of adoption and just given how appealing the proposition is. And hivemapper, of course, is the other one that again weve been talking about for a while. And I think its really picking up steam. Its just listed on Coinbase, I think, today.
00:20:02.084 - 00:20:11.352, Speaker B: So, yeah. How are you seeing that industry style? Because I think potentially you've been more skeptical, is that fair to say, on the deep end industry to date? So.
00:20:11.528 - 00:20:11.888, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:11.936 - 00:20:13.044, Speaker B: How are you feeling on it?
00:20:13.424 - 00:21:05.244, Speaker A: So I think I definitely was waiting for things to happen there. I think I looked at helium, for instance, when they were focusing on IoT. I was like, there's nothing here, guys like this, nothing's happening. It's very smart that they kind of pivoted more towards mobile. But now I've started digging some of these projects. One recently, like demo, for instance, I think that's super cool, especially in a world where people have tried this, right? Without crypto, comma AI, was this idea that you'd buy essentially like a camera for your car for a grand, it would connect to your OBD, two ports on your car. It would take advantage of regulations increasing the fidelity of lane change assist because they have more sensors in cars now basically conceivably give you some autopilot esque features for a grant.
00:21:05.244 - 00:21:44.634, Speaker A: And then the trade off is you're helping them train their models. And so they wanted to have a decentralized way. George Hotts, that is the guy who created this company who was a famous hacker for many years, they wanted to decentralize data collection for training AI models for autopilot. It didn't work out. It didn't work out, but it was a very interesting experiment. And the ingredients seem to be all there to kind of decentralize and fight against a giant incumbent like Tesla to build really world class products for people at scale. Demo is cool to me because they're in a lot of ways doing what that company did at a much smaller scale.
00:21:44.634 - 00:22:06.966, Speaker A: The device is only dollar 99, but it still plugs into your port and it helps the company collect a bunch of data, and then that data, you're compensated for that data with the demo token. And so it's almost like this open source Iot network, but it's focused more on just vehicles for now on the road, and I think that it makes.
00:22:06.990 - 00:22:07.702, Speaker B: A ton of sense.
00:22:07.798 - 00:22:38.704, Speaker A: I think they sold out of there. The device is five weeks back, ordered, the data is extremely valuable, and we're starting to see experiments like this outside of the OGS, like helium, um, and obviously like you have the compute uh, ecosystem, whether it's render or ionet, but, but these ones are really interesting when you're dealing with physical movement and objects, you know, out in the real world. So yeah, I'm becoming more bullish is probably the TLDR, but I don't know if you have any other projects that you've been excited about.
00:22:39.164 - 00:24:12.694, Speaker B: Um, teleport, we obviously spoke to them a long time ago, um, to try and basically subvert, um, ubers, monopoly or not monopoly, oligopoly around the world, because they haven't actually managed to dominate every market. But I think it's interesting, but I think when something is being created that just could not be created by a centralized entity, or if you want to create a centralized entity, it's supremely expensive. I think for me that does get me excited, and you only have to look at Google Maps, and there is only basically one street view map of the entire world that's ever been created, and that's by one of the most valuable companies in world. And the idea that a crypto startup is trying to compete with that, and the thing that really gets me excited about deep in projects is, and Alex Thorne actually pushed back against this, and I think hes completely wrong, price really matters, and so what you tend to get is that theyre cheaper and the service that they provide is better, and because its decentralized, and because you are passing on ownership and pseudo equity to early participants, as a result of that, you dont generally have to pay very much to create one of these startups, and the service tends to be better because its outsourced to everyone around the world. So cheaper and a better service for me can disrupt massive industries, because ultimately every disruptor in every market has come in cheaper and better, or at least one of them, and ideally both of them, every disruptor ever.
00:24:13.154 - 00:25:03.114, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels to me like the business model and the stack going forward is open sourced base layer protocol to handle, whether it's on the Uber side, it's going to be connecting drivers and riders and finding the optimal route. Or if you were to conceivably do an Airbnb, it would just be the system that allows you to create a marketplace, show your property online, have people make offers or whatever to schedule time to stay there. Right? That stuff will get open sourced, the operators. So the company that you interact with that is wrapping this interface or this back end into an app, they will just build that front end logic. It's actually pretty similar to like Defi. That's the cleanest example. Metamask is using one inch or whatever on the backend and has an interface for you to just trade and hold your assets.
00:25:03.114 - 00:25:39.804, Speaker A: So it will shift kind of the burden of responsibility to do KYC checks, to like, do background checks on drivers, to, you know, have the nuts and bolts in place to make this a real world business to that front part of the stack. And in doing so, by reducing all that complexity, the engineering complexity of building the systems, your take rate now goes from 30% to like 5%. And I think that's a TL doctor for a lot of these deep end projects. That's why they all work. And I'm mostly talking about the ones that I guess would compete with web two. Whether it's doordash, Airbnb, Uber, decentralizing those. That feels to me like it's not possible.
00:25:39.804 - 00:26:24.074, Speaker A: My only concern is tokenomics are very hard to get right when users are interacting with something a lot. So that is to say, it's a lot easier to have clean tokenomics that work pretty well. If it's passive, whether it's staking once, making liquidity pool once, and just chilling, whether it's connecting this demo device to your vehicles, it's driving, if there's a lot of human interaction at different steps, your attack surface just increases exponentially. That, I think can get solved. So there's two schools of thoughts here. One is how does deepen disintermediate existing web two companies and decentralize them and make them cheaper? And then to your point, there's going to be a whole class of just new things that you can never do before because it's not conceivable for a centralized entity to do it. That's exciting too.
00:26:29.694 - 00:27:27.704, Speaker B: You mentioned difficult to get the tokenomics correct. And that made me think of another very pertinent subject, which is the points meta that has been going on. And really it does feel, I think along with deep in, it feels like probably the other highly plausible, um, way that we're going to see tokens distributed in a brand new way this time around, because it's similar to what we saw in 2021. But it's almost like a refined version of, of the Airdrop meta that we saw last time, where the protocols have more power to curate and incentivize users to, to act in a way which is beneficial to the ecosystem and the protocol, and not just in a short time basis, but over a much longer duration. So Im bullish that points are going to be one of the main metas of this bull market. But I know youve got a load of thoughts on it, Sal, for sure.
00:27:28.444 - 00:28:13.026, Speaker A: So points are interesting. People have been very negative points. They won the airdrop come up. And when people say that to me, my first reaction is, well, thank God you hate them, because they're doing exactly what it was designed to do, which is keep people like you out of it. Right? The whole point of points is to keep the mercenary capitalists kind of nerf, essentially nurse mercenary capitalists, keep them disincentivized to use your product for all the wrong reasons, which is to farm an airdrop. It's still crazy to me that we had this era before just straight liquidity mining, where we're literally just giving the tokens out for doing things that was never going to work. So do not even consider that to be a thing to ever come back.
00:28:13.026 - 00:28:47.254, Speaker A: That is completely untenable. The right way to think about points and the reason why I think they'll never go away, and in fact, they'll increase. I think that's a good thing. We want them to exist. It boils down to this, and I'm kind of inspired heavily by a blog that, a blog that a 16 Z crypto put out about two years ago. So we'll link that in the show notes, because I think, guys, people should read it, and I'll kind of do a TLDR on it. Basically, the whole point of points is you want to separate social capital from financial capital.
00:28:47.254 - 00:29:18.552, Speaker A: Social capital is like your reputation in a system it identifies. Have you contributed value to this platform, and how do you signal that? So that's what points do, right? This is not supposed to be transferable. You should not, this should not be financialized. That's why we're calling it Social Capital. The cleanest example of this is if you go on Reddit, you have Karma. So if you look at someone's Karma and it's Zero, and they're doing a new post now, you know not to take them seriously because they're a new user. Or maybe people just downvoted them a lot and so they're just always wrong.
00:29:18.552 - 00:29:44.004, Speaker A: And on the flip side, if they have a lot of karma, that means they've made a lot of posts that people upvoted. So take them seriously. But Reddit doesn't really have a financial side to this. I know one of their subreddits had moons or whatever that kind of got nerfed. So we're just going to say they didn't have it. The other side of this is Financial Capital. Financial Capital is the token, how do you reward contributors? But the thing is, you want to reward good contributors.
00:29:44.004 - 00:30:27.374, Speaker A: You don't want to just reward everybody. And this is why you can't actually give the tokens straight up to people. And so there's a lot of ways to carve this out, right? You can linearly link your reputation to points and kind of issue them one to one. I don't think that's going to work. I think it makes more sense to decide on convexity. So, for instance, a convex dividend rate is a world where you're giving more points to people that have higher reputation scores and you're disproportionately almost nerfing the ones that are new and giving them a much smaller share. And then the opposite, the inverse of this is actually what Jito did, which is a concave dividend rate where youre front loading most of the distribution to the smaller people.
00:30:27.374 - 00:30:51.844, Speaker A: And as you accrue more reputation, it levels off. And so youre preventing whales from existing, essentially. And I think thats why they did it. I think they saw they had a few massive, massive whales and so they wanted to redistribute capital to decentralize it. And so that's how that happened. Now, the point of all this is it's not like there's not one way to do it. There's a lot of ways to think about it.
00:30:51.844 - 00:31:42.494, Speaker A: It's size, supply, distribution, and then the relationship between points or social capital, whatever you want to call that, and financial capital. But you want to make sure that you're controlling for bad actors who just want to farm and extract as much capital out of your platform as possible. So that's why we want points. And I think they'll actually get more sophisticated. I think we're going to actually see things like decay systems where maybe over time, like you get diluted if you don't continually add value, like your points don't just exist into perpetuity at the same rate. I think we're going to see more sophistication around this. It's not going away and it's a good thing, right? It is aligning incentives with the goal of the protocol and the user behavior.
00:31:43.394 - 00:33:04.168, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been thinking along similar lines, actually, and I think the crucial point of it is that separation between points and the actual tokens, because previously, if you wanted to say, disproportionately benefit the smaller users or disproportionately benefit the earlier users, what they were doing in the last bull market is saying, okay, here's an airdrop moment in time. We've looked retrospectively and we've, that's how we've allocated it. But if you wanted something which was ongoing, last bull market, they were giving out tokens on an ongoing basis and then you can't adjust it for like the smaller guys and the bigger guys, you just don't give yourself that ability. And so what happened was Alameda basically were piling in and farming the shit out of absolutely everything and dumping it on the noobs who were, you know, hoping it was going to go to a million. So it just, all it was was a whales game, last bull market and just dumping on your head after a few days. Whereas that separation, it allows you to get the benefit of continued use and activity over a longer period of time, but it then allows you to say, I am now going to go away and disproportionately benefit the smaller guys, the guys who got in early and any other criteria as well. Because hopefully it's not just going to be as simple as that, as you say.
00:33:04.168 - 00:33:43.020, Speaker B: I hope it's really going to evolve as these protocols understand what uniquely they need to help their protocol grow. Because for some it might be social interactions, it might be a protocol which is maybe a trading social application where you need that sort of Reddit style banter and forums and things like that to really make the application grow. And so I'm really looking forward to, as you say, seeing it develop and bring in hopefully other non financial KPI's into the way that they can then distribute the tokens. But yeah, just to reiterate that separation is absolutely crucial.
00:33:43.052 - 00:34:20.768, Speaker A: I think the other reason why it's crucial, it's great that you brought up Alameda, it's because if you separate the two and you have this non transferable thing, maybe it is a non transferable token, it could just be a database entry. I think that's going to be easier to do initially Reddit, actually in their cryptocurrency subreddit had this thing called moons where they tied it. Your reputation system was karma in that subreddit. So karma that you earned in that subreddit. And then the token was moons, which was on arbitrum. It was actually pretty brilliant. They would only on a monthly cadence, give you these tokens.
00:34:20.768 - 00:35:08.984, Speaker A: And they had a checklist of multipliers and nerfs, essentially, where if you were above the 99.1 percentile of earners, you just got truncated and allocated down to a max amount. So you got capped. And then they would just measure like how much karma did you actually contribute to the subreddit? And they weighed it based on also who upvoted your posts and what their karma was in that subreddit. And so it was very nuanced is my point. And also because you have that time delay between when you earned it throughout the month and when you get it, you can manually like twist the knobs and adjust and kind of kick people out from the allocation. For instance, if Alameda was farming, but they were only farming points, you just identify, hey, this is the same guys taking all the money out of our protocol.
00:35:08.984 - 00:35:31.996, Speaker A: We're not going to give them anything. No one's entitled to anything. Right. Like, every website has terms of service. So it's crazy to me that we don't have even more strict guidelines on who gets to earn tokens for these protocols when you only have one shot to make the token and do the generation event. Absolutely. We should be kind of controlling for who's extracting value out of it and making sure that only the best people are getting those allocations.
00:35:31.996 - 00:35:48.694, Speaker A: And so, yeah, decoupling and having these time delays and controlling for who earns what. And then most importantly, adjusting them over time. It's such a dynamic world. Yeah, that feels to me like a much cleaner, safer way to distribute tokens to users and align incentives.
00:35:50.114 - 00:36:06.554, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the only thing I want to point out is the counter argument here. And obviously by having points which don't have a financial amount associated with them, you are effectively giving all the power and all the control to the protocols developers.
00:36:06.674 - 00:36:07.098, Speaker A: Sure.
00:36:07.186 - 00:36:44.138, Speaker B: And marginfi. So I think great team. Theyve built an awesome product. I think the best borrow land on Solana. But they recently had a bit of a pr nightmare when they came out and said were not even close, basically, to releasing tokens. And anyone whos been farming today to get our points and was hoping for an airdrop, youre just mercenaries and were not interested in rewarding you. Basically it came across as very sort of dismissive and I think thats completely wrong, especially when it comes to borrow lend protocols because the first dollar in is the riskiest dollar.
00:36:44.138 - 00:37:34.774, Speaker B: They are taking huge amounts of smart contract risk when one of these protocols has just started. Weve seen loads and loads of them getting hacked and in fact, around the same time the marginfi started doing points, cipher protocol also did points and they got hacked within a couple of weeks. So youre taking huge amounts of risk and the protocol, as the TVL rises, more people are getting attracted to it because then they think that the airdrop will be worth more and then the team is able to raise at a higher valuation. So there's huge amounts of benefits which are going directly to the team and off the backs of people who have taken the most risk in those early days. So I do think we need to be wary at the same time and need to continue to put pressure, I think, onto these teams basically, so they're not going to take the piss.
00:37:35.914 - 00:38:05.412, Speaker A: That's a good point. Um, you know, my only response to that and probably a good transition actually for the next topic is look, if, if you're taking on more risk to use something like marginfi, then marginfi should just pay you more, give you more yield or something like that. Look at uniswap. It's the product that people use. They ate the impermanent loss because like people just wanted to lp and they wanted to trade tokens. Um, they didn't, they had no plans to do a token until sushi came around. Even Jupiter, everyone used it and now they're doing an airdrop and we probably won't even make a lot of money off of it.
00:38:05.412 - 00:38:24.144, Speaker A: I don't know what you think the drop will end up being, but product first have a reason to use it. If the reason you're using a product is because we're farming an airdrop, that is never going to be sustainable. Someone's going to be mad. A lot of people would be mad at some point. There's no way you're going to make everybody happy there. I don't know.
00:38:24.604 - 00:38:56.984, Speaker B: You're right. The risk should be rewarded with a high yield. By the start of a borrow lend protocol there is no yield because the other side of it should be the demand. And if there's no supply, there's no demand. So you have to just like deepen projects, you have to incentivize supply and you're incentivizing it by promising an airdrop that is the yield. I think it's a very particular case with the borrowline protocols where you have to get over this cold start problem. You're taking on massive risk with the smart contracts that they've utilized.
00:38:56.984 - 00:39:28.054, Speaker B: Yeah. And so these protocols, they do owe a lot, I think, to the early liquidity, certainly the borrower protocols, but, yeah, moving on to Jupiter. I mean, I'm fully psyched. We were talking about it a little bit before we came on air, and I think, for me, I think it's the biggest airdrop since Uniswap. And obviously the Uniswap one was a retrospective one. People weren't expecting it. In fact, it was the first airdrop, so people definitely weren't expecting it.
00:39:28.054 - 00:40:05.866, Speaker B: So this one, I think in terms of the money, which is going to be airdropped over the four rounds that they're going to be doing, I think it will be probably 4 billion plus. Oh, wow. I think that's basically going to be the biggest airdrop. I want to say that out of any protocol, I could be wrong on that, but if it's not the biggest, it's certainly right up there. And I think it's just going to be driving huge amounts of volume on the slider ecosystem for years because it sounds like they are going to potentially be doing it every January. They hinted at that on Twitter yesterday or the day before. So maybe it's just going to be an annual thing.
00:40:05.866 - 00:40:38.496, Speaker B: And so I think for the next three years, there's going to be multi billion dollar reward for continuing to use Solana and predominantly continuing to use Jupyter. Yeah, I'm super psyched. And I think when you compare, for example, NFT trading, currently we see about 100,000 sol volume on nfts. On Solana. That's about $10 million a day. I think we're going to see around a billion dollar cash injection in a couple of weeks. So it's 100 x what the daily NFT trading volumes are.
00:40:38.496 - 00:40:52.134, Speaker B: So if you think what that's going to do to Solana, to spls, to meme coins and to the nfTs. Yeah, I'm hyper bullish. And I think this is sort of the next leg, really, in Solana's story of this bull market.
00:40:53.514 - 00:41:15.954, Speaker A: Where do you think we land with respect to allocations? Assuming, I think you said a billion dollars FDV or something like that, maybe Uniswap's at 6.5, but market cap today is five for Uniswap. Maybe that's the right comp. Maybe not. I think it's a lot of people just make that comp because it's easier. First thing that comes to mind, even though it's fundamentally a different approach. Right.
00:41:15.954 - 00:41:32.094, Speaker A: They're using on the backend other DeFi protocols. But I guess the point is, US dollar terms wise, where do we think this allocation can land? Obviously, it's going to be a lot less than Jito because it's just a lot more wallets that qualify. But, yeah. Curious to hear your thoughts.
00:41:32.554 - 00:41:59.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a million wallets in total. Majority will be receiving the minimum allocation of 200. So I think it will get to a dollar in the early days for sure. And I think it could easily go higher than that. That would put the FDV fully diluted valuation at 10 billion. Maybe it goes $2 20 billion. So it's going to be outrageously expensive compared to something like Uniswap.
00:41:59.754 - 00:42:47.494, Speaker B: But FTV always seems to be a meme during bull markets, not so much during bear markets. The. I think they'll be releasing about 2 billion tokens. So maybe the market cap, circulating market cap will be about 2 billion if it's a dollar. And people will compare that to Uniswap and say, okay, well, that's only 40% of Uniswap right now, so I think people will be able to get comfortable, definitely with the dollar. And I think just as we saw with Jitto, I think it can definitely go higher because all of the recent big airdrops have gone multiples in the days following. So I really don't see why we wouldn't see it this time, especially when you consider the fact that there's going to be an enormous amount of trading in the week coming up to the airdrop because they're going to be dropping a meme coin just to test out all the infrastructure.
00:42:47.494 - 00:43:03.028, Speaker B: So I think there's going to be a load of trading happening then. There's going to be a load of trading happening during the airdrop. And this is just going to make everyone even more bullish about the future of Jupiter. So, yeah, I'm really excited and I think it's going to be pretty defining next two weeks.
00:43:03.206 - 00:43:03.904, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Yeah.
00:43:03.944 - 00:43:04.120, Speaker B: Ten.
00:43:04.152 - 00:43:21.056, Speaker A: Bill Seoul is at 42 market cap, so circulating 55. Yeah, I mean, that would be insane if it hit that, but you just never know anymore. After. After judo, I don't really know. The numbers don't make sense. They don't add up anymore.
00:43:21.200 - 00:43:29.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I do agree. Jeeto got to. It was over. I think the valuation of lido plus plus flashbacks.
00:43:29.874 - 00:43:30.274, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:30.314 - 00:44:47.054, Speaker B: And how can that be? The amount of staked ETH in liquid staking protocols is much, much, much higher. The percentage of total ETH is much, much higher than it is on Solana and obviously the value of ETH is much, much higher. So they're making far more rewards on ethereum. But it either comes down to bull market delirium or it comes down to just how bullish people are on the future of this ecosystem, the impact that low fees and high throughput can have on things like trading and things like Mev with Jito. So it's really hard to explain, but I think if anything is going to get an element of absolute insanity around it, I think it's this Jupiter drop, because it's the first time we're seeing an aggregator really at play in crypto. It's too expensive to do on ethereum l one, it's too difficult to do on the l two s because you're having to bridge between them all and just between the fees and the bridging and all of that, you just lose the benefits of aggregation. But on Jupyter you can aggregate and so it just makes it a far more effective tool at trading and at finding best price.
00:44:47.054 - 00:45:09.724, Speaker B: And I think as a result of that, I think it's just going to become a natural locus of crypto trading in general in the future, because already you can get better quotes for ETH, for wrapped ETH on Solana than you can on ether one, which is absolutely insane. And I think that trend is only going to continue to get stronger and stronger over the next few years.
00:45:10.144 - 00:45:38.444, Speaker A: That's insane. Insane metric. I'm just looking at this chart right now, Jupiter traders by bucket. We'll link this one too in the show notes. But basically the story here, other than the massive increase in volume, which everyone knows, is how much more people with a lot of money in Solana are trading on a weekly basis. So for instance, in the last week, 130 people did over a million in weekly volume. 1500 did one hundred k to a million.
00:45:38.444 - 00:46:16.740, Speaker A: Fifty thousand did ten to 100k. That's a very material amount of people. If we go back to just, I don't know, the summer there was 5000 people total using this, just five k, and now there's five k doing tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars of volume on Jupiter. The wealth effect is real. It's happened, it's there in plain sight, and we're inning one or two of this bull run. I think it's clear to me that we've kind of crossed this chasm. We have the capital here and really interesting things will be happening on Solana.
00:46:16.740 - 00:46:41.784, Speaker A: So I don't know, I was pretty blown away when I saw this chart. I mean, it's basically saying that 20% of all users on Jupiter are doing more than $1,000 in volume. So they're all four figures or more. So that's like you can't really make that dollar store kind of chain meme anymore. Like people with money are kind of using this in decent size for retail especially. Thats pretty interesting to me.
00:46:43.444 - 00:47:38.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I think two factors, isnt it? Sol has twelve x or something from the absolute bottom in a year and the SPL tokens have generally done ten x if not a lot more. And the meme coins, some of them have done 100 x if not more. So theres huge amounts of wealth that have been created. And then the other thing is how quickly liquidity will travel if there is airdrop incentives. And we saw it during the last bull market, so I'm really not surprised. But when you consider now the size of Solana, the ecosystem, suddenly those airdrops hold a lot more attraction to liquidity that's currently sitting outside the ecosystem. So we're just seeing this onboarding and then it creates this virtuous cycle because as more liquidity comes through, the trading volumes go up, the NFT prices go up, the airdrop rewards are going to keep on going up as well.
00:47:38.186 - 00:48:13.714, Speaker B: So were just going to, yeah, the wheel has started and it was that cold start problem which we were facing during the bear market. And as you say, I think weve crossed the chasm and that has now well and truly is behind us, exemplified really yesterday by Franklin Templeton on their US Twitter account, including basically saying bitcoin ethan Sol and yeah, saying what do they say about ETH is having a midlife crisis? And then including Sol is one of the big three. And I think it's a good manifestation of where the market is right now.
00:48:14.294 - 00:48:34.894, Speaker A: Insanity. I didn't think this will happen so fast, but it clearly has. Well, this is super fun. We covered a lot of stuff. I think we should do this more often, just take a pulse of what's happening and. Sorry, I was just, I just got reminded of Jamie Dimon and the Satoshi comment. So that's how you know.
00:48:34.894 - 00:49:06.084, Speaker A: So the one, one closing comment I'll make is the top signals for the last market are going to look very different from this market. That's the takeaway from this Franklin Templeton thing is like, that's not a top signal anymore. Now that's like the baseline. So multiply that by ten and that is actually the real top signal. I think Chow kind of tweeted about this or something along those lines, and I agree. We're not going to be able to recognize them, so let's get better at recognizing them and take things to the next logical extreme before we call the market.
00:49:06.744 - 00:49:33.696, Speaker B: Because if we're going to get to $10 trillion asset, things have to go five x crazier than they did last time. So I completely agree. I think as well, the meme coins starting a bull market and retail aren't even here yet. That's the crazy thing. They're still not here. This is just crypto people. And I think it's the smart money basically that's come in and that wealth effect now is circulating around the people who are already here.
00:49:33.696 - 00:49:53.596, Speaker B: Retail aren't here yet. They'll get here. When bitcoin hits all time high and suddenly it's sprayed all over the news channels, that's when they come. So 100%. This gets a lot crazier. And people who think that with is going to top out at a dollar, which is, you know, it's like a two x from here or something. It's like, no, this is.
00:49:53.596 - 00:49:55.140, Speaker B: Everything is about to go crazy.
00:49:55.212 - 00:50:07.164, Speaker A: You have to remove the bear market bias and really open up your mind for insanity, which is uncomfortable to do, but perhaps it's time to do that. Awesome. This is, this is a fun chat and we'll be doing this more.
