00:00:00.120 - 00:00:25.514, Speaker A: I suppose when you think about Web two, I suppose the infrastructure had to be built out and then suddenly you had that cambrian explosion of the application. So do you think it's just a case of, we just need that first one really to hit true product market fit outside of the crypto circles before suddenly people say, okay, you can actually make good money and there is an audience which can be attracted.
00:00:26.290 - 00:01:02.984, Speaker B: That's right. To, and it needs to be consumer facing. Like, I mean, I love deep look multicoint. Can I help pioneer depend? So we obviously have spent a lot of time there working very closely with helium and Hivemapper and then render and file coin and some other things as well, although those are a little different than helium and Hivemapper. But those don't capture consumer attention in the way that like Reddit does or whatever, or Robin Hood. Yeah, I think. I think the bar in my mind is consumer something my mom, even if she wouldn't use it, would at least understand it.
00:01:02.984 - 00:01:29.504, Speaker B: And that is, in my opinion, the single most important question. And I believe the tooling exists today to do that, at least on Solana, on Arbitrum, that's less clear or optimism. But the gas fees are low enough. You can have, the developer can pay for gas, you've got social sign on and account abstraction and all that stuff. It's there. Latency is low. You can build these experiences.
00:01:29.504 - 00:01:47.136, Speaker B: Dialect is a great example. Dialect is not yet a mainstream consumer app. Chris and the team are playing with a bunch of, we're investors in dialect. Chris and the team are playing with a bunch of interesting ideas. Hopefully that breaks out to mainstream. We'll see. But we need something to hit.
00:01:47.136 - 00:02:26.072, Speaker B: And I think it's pretty lazy to say, like, the infra's not ready for sure. Like software farcaster works like, we can, we can get these things. And like, you want to be able to at least iterate and see these experiments running and unlocking these social behaviors and that really, like all the other variables don't matter. Like, it'll be amazing how quickly perceptions and discourse will change when there is market wide consensus that this app is a big deal and will generally capture consumer mainstream attention, all prior discourse will stop mattering.
00:02:26.208 - 00:03:05.094, Speaker C: Yeah, so I want to talk a bit about that because you brought up Farcaster, and obviously some go to examples of successful web, two apps, Snapchat, Reddit, things like that. My question has always been lens protocol, Farcaster, they're out. They've been out for a while. I've used them, but it's unclear to me, how exactly does crypto make this a better app, so to speak? Like, theoretically, people care about the social graph and portability of that. In practice, I kind of push back on, like, the reason why I use YouTube is because Mrbeast is on there, not because he can move his followers from one place to another. That's why he's spending so much money on those videos, by the way. It's because the reach is just massive.
00:03:05.094 - 00:03:18.254, Speaker C: It's hundreds of millions, not tens of thousands. So I guess my of question is, what is the low hanging fruit for crypto to improve a consumer app? How can they actually be ten to 100 x better than existing apps?
00:03:18.794 - 00:03:46.734, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can't compete against these apps that you just named, or that I've named on the vectors that matter for them, which I'm going to just loosely call. They have the content you want, whether that comes from your friends or from the recommendation algorithm or whatever. Web three doesn't compete there. Web three, you know, there's like, at the social layer, there's like interesting theories of what web3 enables. One is like ownership graph. I'm kind of skeptical of that theory, but there's a bunch of people playing around with that idea.
00:03:46.734 - 00:04:23.660, Speaker B: Another is like the kind of fan club, NFT gated, private community idea. Again, I'm pretty skeptical there, but there's a bunch of people playing with those ideas. A third is layering financialization into some of these behaviors. That one is the one I'm kind of the most interested in. And that maps like, best to Twitter. At least the maps better to Twitter than it does to Instagram or YouTube or TikTok or Snapchat. Yeah, so, like, you know, if such a thing is going to work, it's not that you beat Twitter on having a better algorithm.
00:04:23.660 - 00:05:10.952, Speaker B: That's not the thing. You have to layer in some notion of financialization in a way that's compelling. That might be a vector that matters. If you look at dialect, the core theory, there is a new opportunity for creative monetization for creators, and it's bundling both the revenue opportunity with this new communication media, which is these private chat rooms where the creator's there with some of the superfans. And so the goal is to create a new kind of experience for people to interact with those creators. Unclear if that scales to huge volumes, but, like, maybe there's something there. There's other vectors people are playing with around these things.
00:05:10.952 - 00:05:51.774, Speaker B: So I haven't named all of them. But my point is, though, is that if there's going to be a large scale successful web3 consumer thing. It's going to need to lean pretty strongly into like one of these social attributes either that I have identified or there's others that I missed in that kind of quick rant. But that's going to be the key. You have to believe that those things unlock some sort of new behavior in psychology that didn't exist before and that are inherently tied to status access, money trading in some way that's meaningful. Another interesting one is social tokens. There's obviously been a handful of attempts at social tokens so far.
00:05:51.774 - 00:06:15.514, Speaker B: As far as I can tell all of them have flopped. The newest iteration of this seems to be a thing called unlonely which disclosure we are investor in. I think the social token. I think social tokens will be a thing interesting and they map pretty well to crypto so maybe that's the right vector to get to like large scale social consumery thing. I don't know. Is it a theory.
