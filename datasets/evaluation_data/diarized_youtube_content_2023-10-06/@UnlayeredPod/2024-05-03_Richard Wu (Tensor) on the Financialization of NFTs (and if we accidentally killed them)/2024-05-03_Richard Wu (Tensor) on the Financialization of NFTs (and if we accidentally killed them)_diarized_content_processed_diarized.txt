00:00:14.880 - 00:00:27.094, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the podcast where we explore next generation blockchains. I'm your host, Saul, alongside my co host Dave. And today we're joined by Richard from Tensorflow. Richard, how's it going, man?
00:00:27.714 - 00:00:29.574, Speaker B: Hey, guys, thanks for having me on.
00:00:30.154 - 00:00:39.954, Speaker A: Awesome. Love to see it. Are you calling us from the office? Do you guys have an office presence? I'm not even sure these days, with so many remote teams, we do, yeah.
00:00:39.994 - 00:01:07.784, Speaker B: So we have an office, rather, two small offices in a co working space. So imagine like a weWork, but with like two small private offices. Actually not a weWork. It's. It's a. I don't know if you guys heard of it, but, like, staples, pretty big here in Canada and pretty big here in the states, and they have co working spaces now. So we just found two good deals for two small private offices and we're just bunkering down up here in Toronto, Canada.
00:01:08.284 - 00:01:18.984, Speaker A: Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. I've never actually made it out to Toronto, but I hear it's a really cool city, super fun and pretty different, I think, from many other kind of cities in North America.
00:01:19.524 - 00:01:32.784, Speaker C: Am I right in thinking that when you guys were starting out on the project, I think maybe Ilya came from Europe to Canada so you could work side by side, face to face, as opposed to doing it digitally?
00:01:33.524 - 00:02:21.690, Speaker B: Exactly. So I'm actually from Toronto, was born and raised here, but maybe I can talk a bit about the backstory of how I met Ilya. So that will provide more context for why we ended up in Toronto. So basically, back in 2022, January, or I want to say February January, I was working a full time job at two Sigma as a quant researcher. And at the time I was basically starting to get the itch to start a company to work on a product from, basically from scratch, build a product from scratch. And so I wanted to look for a co founder, and that's when I went on YC startup schools, co founding matching portal, and that's where I found Ilya's profile. And so he had been building on Solana for just about a year when I found his profile.
00:02:21.690 - 00:02:52.424, Speaker B: And so I just started chatting with him. I had some interest in web3, but I wasn't totally red pilled into it. And so we just started exchanging notes back and forth until one thing led to another. We said, okay, let's work on this full time. And so I decided to quit my job. He had already been sort of working independently on his own projects for a bit. And so he's from a Riga, like Riga, Lafayette, and so he decided to fly down to Toronto so that we could jam together in person in like, almost like a hacker room together.
00:02:52.424 - 00:02:56.504, Speaker B: And, you know, the rest of history sort of plays itself out.
00:02:57.364 - 00:03:22.364, Speaker A: So that's super interesting. I've actually looked at the YC co founder matching tool before, and I never actually heard of too many stories of successful companies to come out of co founders finding each other through there. So that's an interesting data point. Was he kind of the first person you collabed with and just ran with it from there, or did you have to go through a lot of meetings to kind of get to him?
00:03:23.304 - 00:03:44.094, Speaker B: It was definitely not the first person I found and actually reached out to. I would say I got on the phone with about probably three or four people. So generally I have pretty high filtering bar for, like, people that I want to just chat with, jump on a phone call with, because that takes time. If you jump on the phone with, like, every single person you find remotely interesting.
00:03:44.174 - 00:03:44.454, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:44.494 - 00:03:50.278, Speaker B: Then you'll probably end up wasting, you know, 20 hours, 30 hours a week just going through, just doing phone calls.
00:03:50.366 - 00:03:50.694, Speaker A: Totally.
00:03:50.734 - 00:04:34.560, Speaker B: I probably went through about three or four people. None of them really, like, none of them really had that excitement, that drive that I was looking for in a co founder. And I think until I sort of got on the phone with Ilya where he basically, like, on the first call, he showed up with a checklist of things that he was, like, looking for in a co founder. And that's when I knew, like, okay, ilya is serious. He's in it to actually, like, dedicate his life, dedicate the next three, four years of his life to building a startup, like, 110%. And so that's when I knew, like, okay, this is probably the person that I want to work. But, you know, to your earlier point about not hearing too many, like, successful companies come out of YC or, like, come out of, like, any co founder matching portal.
00:04:34.560 - 00:04:39.016, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's just because there's a lot of, there's a lot of noise there, for sure.
00:04:39.120 - 00:04:39.752, Speaker A: Yep.
00:04:39.888 - 00:04:59.244, Speaker B: There are a lot of people who are maybe interested in doing a startup, but perhaps are not ready, like, mentally and also, like, I guess, in a good place in their life to actually do a startup. And I think, like, kind of have to figure that out through trial and error and also looking for the right people who are in the right mindset at the time to do a company.
00:04:59.864 - 00:05:24.034, Speaker A: What did you want to find in someone? You mentioned the drive and kind of passion towards doing something greater, which you definitely need to get through the trials and tribulations of a startup. Was it a certain skill set or because they always say the best co founder is one that can kind of complement what you do, and together you guys can cover a lot of ground. How did you think about your proverbial checklist?
00:05:26.014 - 00:06:08.182, Speaker B: I would say I had more of a guideline than a checklist at the time. I 100% wanted someone who was technical, so I wanted to build a startup that was somewhat technically challenging. It wasn't like, you know, yet another SaaS app, it wasn't yet another mobile app. I wanted someone who had the technical know how. So, for example, I wouldn't be the only developer on the founding team to be working on the product. And I think that's really powerful in that a lot of successful web two startups in the world were founded by at least two or more technical co founders. Obviously there are exceptions, like the Airba founders.
00:06:08.182 - 00:06:13.118, Speaker B: I think one of them was a designer by trade and was non technical to that extent.
00:06:13.206 - 00:06:13.478, Speaker A: Sure.
00:06:13.526 - 00:06:38.534, Speaker B: But even then, all of them were. All of them have product expertise versus just, I guess, almost like only business expertise. And I think that really matters. If you're a product first startup team and you really value building a good product or a really great product and getting users through the door versus going down the hype cycle, the marketing and trying to drive users out.
00:06:39.234 - 00:06:39.594, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:39.634 - 00:07:19.994, Speaker B: So technical co founder was one of my top criterias. I would say the second one is someone who had a lot of drive and motivation, because I sort of like understood firsthand from just working on a variety of like school projects, even side projects, hackathon projects, that the one thing that you can't like, teach someone or influence someone is their motivation and their drive. If they don't have that strong drive that would actually convince them to spend 70, 80 hours a week working on one thing and one thing only, which is a startup, then it's very hard to teach that to them. Even if you yourself is a highly motivated, highly driven person.
00:07:20.654 - 00:07:49.984, Speaker A: I totally get that it's all intrinsic and it's something you should screen for, but it's not always apparent when you're just like reading a profile or something like that, which is something. It's a challenge I've come across too, when I was at a stage where I was looking for co founders. But how did you guys divide the actual work of building this killer product? What did each of you focus on? Because obviously it's, as you said, a pretty technically challenging endeavor to build something like tensor from scratch.
00:07:50.724 - 00:08:34.822, Speaker B: What's interesting is that neither of us had experience. One had experience building an exchange or a marketplace. Neither of us had experience building a consumer app that serviced tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of users. And we kind of just figured out all of that stuff along the way. I would say one thing that worked great for us is that both of us were unafraid to learn and we sort of had like the fundamental chops to actually code stuff or to figure stuff out. Even if we didn't know how to do it, we both knew how the basics of coding. I did a bunch of software engineering internships before I did my quant research role at two Sigma.
00:08:34.822 - 00:09:21.616, Speaker B: And then I obviously learned how to code. I went to school for Cs. Ilya was a self taught programmer, and so he in some ways, like learned everything on his own and so had that, had that almost like intrinsic ability to just pick up stuff really quickly. So I think all of that is highly crucial for essentially two guys who are trying to build a really great product and eventually turn it into startup. Both of those are really crucial if you want to essentially jump into something that you've never done before. And so I think to answer your question, we basically just had some idea of what we wanted to build and basically said, okay, I'll work on the front end, you work on the back end, and alternating weeks, you might switch. Okay, I'll work on the back end now and you work on the front end.
00:09:21.616 - 00:09:24.984, Speaker B: We just kind of like pick stuff up as we, as we build tensor.
00:09:25.684 - 00:09:37.596, Speaker C: And how did you agree on the market to go after? And also, how did you think about differentiating yourself from the competition? Because obviously magic Eden were pretty dominant. I think when you guys came on.
00:09:37.780 - 00:10:50.232, Speaker B: I think at the time we had this thesis, and I think this thesis played out many times in history. And that is there was a heavily underserved user segment that we saw when it comes to NFT trading, and that was the pro user segment. We knew that FTX in the past also had the same thesis about token trading. And they said to themselves, hey, we know all of these sophisticated market makers, know all of these pro traders who traded tokens on Coinbase, who traded tokens on binance, but neither of those platforms are really geared towards that pro trader user profile. And for us, we basically saw the same thing. We saw that existing NFT marketplaces are really to some extent like carbon copies of existing web two marketplaces like Amazon, like eBay, like Etsy, and they were really geared towards the retail audience. And we just saw that there was a non trivial percentage of users who are trading nfts every single day that were more like almost like token traders who wanted a terminal like experience when it came to NFT trade.
00:10:50.232 - 00:11:14.754, Speaker B: We personally, ourselves wanted that experience, too. And so it was kind of a no brainer to us that if we ourselves wanted a terminal like experience for trading nfts, and if we know 10, 20, 30 other guys in our DM's right now who also want something similar, then why not build it and see what happens? And so that was essentially the impetus for building tensor, the pro trading marketplace on Solana for nfts.
00:11:15.934 - 00:11:22.914, Speaker A: Take us back to that. Did you guys initially release in the summer of 22, or was it earlier than that?
00:11:23.214 - 00:11:37.452, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been a wild year. I think it was. Trying to get the dates correct, we decided to start building tensor, the pro trading platform, the marketplace. Honestly, beginning of May 2022.
00:11:37.558 - 00:11:38.392, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:11:38.488 - 00:11:44.664, Speaker B: We launched our closed beta in June of 2022, and then we went public in July of 2022.
00:11:44.744 - 00:11:45.208, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:11:45.256 - 00:12:03.364, Speaker B: So it's basically a month after each crucial decision point that we went from deciding to build, build the product. We built the product, launched it to a bunch of, you know, private users, and then we played it to the public and basically just observed and saw what happened over time.
00:12:03.764 - 00:12:54.374, Speaker A: Yeah. Take us back to that timeframe in the sense that, because I remember covering nfts at Galaxy as a researcher at the time. I remember when my buddy told me about tensor for the first time, I think it was around July, if I'm not mistaken, of 22. That seems to line up. But at the time I was reading articles like Kyle Simani's piece on the verticalization of NFT marketplaces. And thematically, it was very non obvious to me that this style of a marketplace, a pro trading oriented NFT trading marketplace, would become, fast forward a year, the gold standard, the de facto thing that people are using. What was the kind of feedback you got initially when you launched? Was it challenging to almost go upstream against what a lot of these vc's were thinking the future of nfts would be at the time?
00:12:54.754 - 00:14:14.844, Speaker B: So I think there are two points to your question on the pro trading aspect, and basically, most of the market didn't really see that thesis. I would say there were a couple of people who actually saw that thesis like Blur. So for those who don't know, Blur is pro trading platform on Ethereum, and they actually started building around the same time we did, but they launched their public beta a couple of months after we launched ours but we both identified the same opportunity in the market, and we were like, hey, why not build this pro NFT marketplace on our respective chains and basically see what happens? Because we knew that with all exchanges out there, token exchanges, equity exchanges, thats sort of my background. Like the traditional financial markets, theres this parallel effect where the top 20% of traders, the top 20% of market makers make up 80% of the volume, right. They take 80% of the other side and 80% of people that are trading on these exchanges, whether it's through broker apps like Robinhood, whether it's through fidelity interactive brokers, they probably make up about 20% of the volume, right. And so we knew that's this power dynamic, this power law dynamic plays out on exchanges and would play out on NFT marketplaces. And we saw early inklings of this idea.
00:14:14.844 - 00:14:40.094, Speaker B: And so based on first principles, we knew that, okay, even if we cater to 20% of users, but they're all high volume pro traders, we could capture 80% of the volume, right. It doesn't matter if our daily active user count isn't as high as existing places because volume is sort of, volume is sort of our north star when it comes to, you know, tensor when it comes to any marketplace. And we knew that we could potentially dominate.
00:14:41.594 - 00:15:31.660, Speaker A: I didn't realize you guys were, I thought you were. You beat blur. I didn't realize it was by two months to the beta. I was always curious, like what the timeline was between both you guys because that comparison is made all the time. Now that we've brought up blur, one quick question that maybe is more controversial is how do you respond to the notion that blur killed nfts? We're in a state where trading volumes are down a lot. We've commoditized the heck out of them and just turned them all into this game of sending them back and forth and put the airdrop farming aside, just almost killing some of the beauty or value prop of nfts and turning it into this almost commoditized experience, how do you respond to this frustration?
00:15:31.852 - 00:16:25.740, Speaker B: I think it's not a black and white answer. I would say that people who are saying blur killed nfts are not entirely incorrect. They're also not entirely correct in the sense that just because a marketplace that was more financialized, that focused on the pro traders, that focused on adding more liquidity to the markets, came around, that they alone were not the reasons why NFT prices went down quite a bit. Since it's high, there are multitude of factors to that. I would say one thing that blur may have missed or underestimated was how crazy, how crazy the farming of blur points ended up being, and that people were literally taking thousands of losses in order to, like, increase their blur points.
00:16:25.852 - 00:16:26.188, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:26.236 - 00:17:27.339, Speaker B: And I think that holds, like, that the negative externalities of that blur farming and points farming is real. I think that did cause a bunch of artificial activity, a bunch of artificial liquidity, which caused, like, massive cascading, positive and negative feedback loops to happen in the NFT market. And I think that's what a lot of people saw extremely for us. Like, we have a similar point system. And I think based on what we saw with Blur and the craziness that went on in season one and two of, of Blur's airdrop, we kind of like, took a step back and said to ourselves, okay, we're seeing what's happening on Ethereum. We're seeing how crazy farming can get. How can we adjust our formula, how can adjust our points so that people aren't essentially causing these wild feedback loops to happen in the NFT? So I guess TLDR is like, you know, financialization of nfts is inevitable.
00:17:27.339 - 00:17:47.943, Speaker B: Like, if Blur didn't come around, I think some other marketplace would have done the same. And I think more liquid markets is better in general for any asset class, whether it's nfts, whether it's tokens, whether it's equities. That being said, I think blur could have done better with their point system and could have reacted much quicker based on what they were seeing in the market.
00:17:49.003 - 00:18:22.894, Speaker C: But do you think incentivization via things like points, via things like tokens is always a bad thing? Because obviously that's basically what kicked off the last bull market kicked off defi summer, and people were very happy about that. I would agree that there was a slight pump and dump element to it, but it was definitely received well. And I wonder if it's got more to do with the fact that that was at the start of a bull market, whereas blur has more come at the end of a bull market, start of a bear market. Do you think that might be the bigger factor?
00:18:24.234 - 00:19:29.594, Speaker B: Yep. Like, like I mentioned earlier, there, there are so many factors at play here that I think one, like just macro sentiment, it just coincided with blur launching their points program. And so, you know, nfts falling in price because, you know, risk is entirely off. Cross stock markets like that coincided so perfectly that it's hard to, like, say, okay, Blur contributed x percent of NFT prices dropping, and the macro sentiment contributed y percent I think that's, it's hard to pull out. I do think the incentivization, the heavy incentivization of points and the crazy farming that happens did contribute to those wild price swings, both on the upside and on the downside. To your earlier point about incentivization, I do think it's important. I think that is what separates Web three from Web two, and that in web two, it's very difficult to incentivize your users to have values that are aligned with the platform, whereas in Web three, you can do that with things like points, with things like airdrops, with things like tokens.
00:19:29.594 - 00:19:45.824, Speaker B: And I think that's what's interesting about Web three in that, like, the users are part of the journey of an up and coming NFT marketplace, an up and coming, you name it, consumer platform and crypto. Incentivization is very important, but it has to be done right.
00:19:46.644 - 00:20:27.124, Speaker A: Right. And a good point to make on what both of you guys are talking about is looks rare was kind of the first to attempt a vampire attack, Opensea with their looks token. But the timing of their attack was better because it was still pretty much a bull market, at least as far as nfts were concerned. And we still saw the all time highs for things like bored apes and stuff months after they did that. I do think the market has a pretty big influence on this stuff too. It's hard to parse out all of that. One thing, actually, you brought up on our spaces a few weeks ago how you think about product design and the future of tensor.
00:20:27.124 - 00:21:02.904, Speaker A: You mentioned that more and more users, and I think it might have been as high as 75%, prefer the light interface on tensor and more simplified view. With that data in mind, how are you envisioning the product design for this platform, and how do you think about design now? Because it's at this point where it's almost like all of the power users might, you know, that market is only so big, and to keep expanding, you almost need to cater to the general retail users that you mentioned before, which is the exact user base you weren't targeting when you first came up with Tensorflow.
00:21:03.794 - 00:22:23.704, Speaker B: Yep. So to recap what I mentioned on the spaces, probably a couple of weeks ago, what I said was that what we're seeing on our platform right now, in our metrics, is that we have, we have two modes in our app right now. We have the lite mode, which is for the more retail users, for users who prefer a simpler interface. And then we have our pro mode, which was basically, the original version of our app, which had almost like the terminal like experience that you would see on a binance, that you would see on an FTX, that you would see on a Coinbase Pro. And what we're seeing is that the number of users using the pro interface has actually plateaued for us, while the number of users using our lite mode is actually still increasing day over day. And so what that basically tells us is that, okay, our product has now saturated most of the pro users who are trading nfts right now in Solana. And perhaps we should start thinking about how can we make tensor the marketplace for everyone? How can we make tensor one be a really great product for the pros? We don't deviate that, like, no matter what we build in the future, but how do we take some experience and make it, you know, essentially appealing to people who are using a Robin Hood.
00:22:23.704 - 00:23:13.874, Speaker B: Right, to trade stocks versus using a fidelity? So that's really our, that's really the next big milestone, or I guess the next big phase of tensor is actually building out an experience that is for the retail audience, that is for the consumer who, who don't care about the flashy, you know, candlestick charts, who don't care about, you know, the order book flashing red and, or red and green every single second. Yeah, but who wants, like, a Robin Hood experience for trading nfts? So, I mean, I can't say too much more because a lot of the stuff is, you know, yeah, we're building towards it. We want to keep everything a little bit low key, but we are thinking about bringing an experience that is much more like the Robin Hood for nfts than, you know, the binance for nfts. That makes sense.
00:23:15.174 - 00:24:03.304, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's really important because obviously, when the next bull market comes along, you're suddenly, hopefully going to have more sort of normie retail participants entering the market. And so I think it makes complete sense to try and get ahead of that, really, and make sure you guys can capture that as much as possible. I am interested in this idea about moats within web3 applications, and obviously you've talked about points, I think has been like a really, really big one for you guys. And actually, when you first announced season one, I think that's when you really had your massive uptick in support because maybe the other NFT marketplaces weren't necessarily supporting users as much, so you've managed to build up a good following from that. So, yeah, just wondering how you're thinking about customer retentions.
00:24:05.144 - 00:25:01.504, Speaker B: I would say the points that loyalty counter essentially gamification of our platform, I wouldn't say that's emote for us because it's clearly like it's very easy to replicate. Other marketplaces on Solana have started introducing some form or some sort of gamification to their platforms. And I think at the end of the day, that's not what's going to keep your users around. I think in web3, specifically for consumer apps like Tensor, I think the biggest moat of anything, it's not liquidity. I don't think it's liquidity as we've clearly seen time and time again with vampire tax, with incentivization drawing away that liquidity. I also don't think it's, I don't think it's entirely just brand. I think it's actually, it's a mixture of a really great product and people's habits being tied to using your product every single day.
00:25:01.504 - 00:25:51.464, Speaker B: I think that is something that is very hard to disrupt. If someone uses your product every single day, creates a habit where they know exactly where all the buttons are on the app, where they're used to clicking the top right corner to see their inventory, where they're used to seeing a table on the left summarizing their entire portfolio, and a giant massive gallery view of their nfts. And they're used to the whole, the styling of the platform and where all the little buttons are. I think that's what is emote for every single consumer app in crypto right now. I think everything else is basically table stakes for someone to come in and do the same and copy. But you'll, if you maintain that user touchpoint, and if you maintain that almost like the closest touchpoint you have to the user, and thats very hard to disrupt.
00:25:52.604 - 00:26:33.124, Speaker A: So these days were seeing a lot of interesting innovation on the liquid token side of consumer trading. That is to say, things like Unibot and now banana gun sniper, I think its called its competitor to them and even just friend tech. Im not sure what exactly it would call it. I guess the keys kind of resemble nfts. But another example, they demonstrated Pwas might be a thing for consumer crypto apps. So with all of this recent activity, how are you thinking about the future of consumer crypto experiences? Are you guys taking away some lessons from these experiments and potentially integrating them?
00:26:33.904 - 00:27:04.518, Speaker B: In the last cycle, we didn't see the mass consumer adoption or the mass adoption of crypto like we would have imagined, maybe three, four years when Defi happened, like in 2019 and then when NFT started happening in 2020, we thought that this was the super cycle. In fact, a lot of, like, high profile crypto influencers basically said, yes, this is the super cycle of crypto. We're going to the moon, everything.
00:27:04.566 - 00:27:05.870, Speaker A: Top signal solved.
00:27:05.982 - 00:27:39.314, Speaker B: Exactly. I think we didn't see that mass adoption happening in the last cycle because frankly, consumer apps, or crypto apps are still very difficult to use. So I'll give you an anecdote here. I wasn't red pilled into crypto at all into 2017. And in 2017, I only used Coinbase. And that was fine. I was fine with kycing, I was fine with logging into an apple, waiting a couple of days for my profile to be approved, and then I could start trading ethereum, I could start trading bitcoin.
00:27:39.314 - 00:28:39.248, Speaker B: Then in 2020, 2021, when I started getting back into crypto, I tried to buy an NFT on OpenSea and I basically just gave up because one, I had to figure out how to use metamask. Two, there was this thing called we, right, instead of Eric. And obviously I wasn't deep enough to understand what the difference was. And so I was confused by the whole wrapping process and I basically just stopped using Opensea after that. So I think the friction of, one, self custody and like seed phrases and all of that, and using a current generation wallet, that's a huge friction point. And two, I feel like a lot of apps are still built for crypto natives and not thinking about how do we make everything understandable for the average consumer, for the average consumer who are using existing mobile apps. So those are the two things that we're focusing heavily on for the next user experience.
00:28:39.248 - 00:29:05.354, Speaker B: For tensor, is the self custody aspect, like, do people want to, do people care about storing this twelve word seed phrase, or are they fine with perhaps a compromise there so that they don't have to think about twelve word sequences? And two, how can you make the experience as flawless and as simple to understand as buying something off Amazon or buying something off eBay?
00:29:06.854 - 00:29:22.624, Speaker C: Just wondering, are NFT marketplaces naturally held back from becoming applications because of the 30% tax that you get with Apple? Does that stop you from being able to release an application which could potentially further improve adoption?
00:29:22.964 - 00:29:54.504, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's the biggest hurdle right now to why there is no NFT trading app on mobile right now that's used by millions of people. Right? Yeah, I think obviously, like Apple and to some extent Google as well, they have their own pie to protect, which is in game purchases and the billions of dollars that they're making people playing, you know, clash of clans people playing. I don't know what they're playing. Like some. Some gotcha game on mobile. Candy Crush.
00:29:54.504 - 00:30:11.664, Speaker B: They make candy crush. Exactly. They make billions and billions of dollars on that. And I think it'll be many years until we start them. Relax their tax. Relax their essentially 30% tax rules for crypto apps for NFT marketplaces. But I think to.
00:30:11.664 - 00:30:31.374, Speaker B: I think Saul's earlier point is that there's the pwas that friendtech sort of reinvigorated. I think that's a very likely loophole into the whole tax system of Apple. Of course you're not going to build an experience as good as a native app, but maybe that's okay, right, if that means you can trade nfts on mobile.
00:30:32.594 - 00:31:21.080, Speaker A: So to that point, let's assume we're in this future where now every single crypto app is doing some spin on a PWA. How do you see self custody playing out? And I think this is very. It's especially an important consideration for you guys because NFT trading has to be non custodial. There is no way to centralize custody of nfts and have people trade them like an FTX or Coinbase. So we're kind of shoving users immediately in day one to, like, try to use a wallet, interact with it, maybe sign a transaction and trade. How do you guys see wallets playing out? I think I have my views on this, which I've expressed in a few spaces, but certainly that we're at this tipping point now with a lot of new innovations that are pretty much on the cusp of being ready, like things like account abstraction or they already are out there. Things like embedded NPC wallets, which we saw, again with.
00:31:21.080 - 00:31:23.644, Speaker A: With Friendtech. How do you guys think about this?
00:31:25.384 - 00:31:49.476, Speaker B: Probably not deep enough to understand what the solutions beyond just self custody is. I understand, you know, there's. There are solutions that are fully custodial, essentially, where there's a service provider who lets your users log in with an email and they'll generate some sort of wallet in the backend that's perhaps protected by fire blocks. That's perhaps governed by some other NPC solution.
00:31:49.620 - 00:31:49.996, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:50.060 - 00:32:05.160, Speaker B: And all your users care about is their email login or Oauth login. Like that. That's. That seems very appealing. I think what friendtech did was kind of like that, where I think they use some sort of Webby privy. Exactly.
00:32:05.192 - 00:32:05.480, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:32:05.512 - 00:32:35.014, Speaker B: They use privy to essentially do the wallet management for their users. So all they care about was logging with it, and I think that's the way to go. Right. Maybe it's not exactly what we're seeing it as today. Maybe there are more secure solutions. I'm not an expert enough to understand, like, what the security trade offs are, but I think that's very promising, is if someone can log in with a passphrase, someone can log in with an email and not have to think about, okay, I have to write down this twelve word seed phrase or else if I lose it, then I lose all of my nfTs.
00:32:35.094 - 00:33:11.954, Speaker A: Right? Right. The twelve word seed phrase is one of the weirdest conundrums because you basically incentivize people to copy paste that into, like, their notes, and now it's basically the least secure way to possibly, or they'll write down a piece of paper and not lock it or something. It creates these weird attack vectors that normally don't exist, even though theoretically, assuming someone practices this perfectly, it is the most secure approach. I think I agree with you. I'm pretty bullish. These alternative approaches that can shard keys with NPC or when account abstraction becomes adopted by more applications and protocols, that could be really promising too.
00:33:17.534 - 00:33:32.694, Speaker C: I'd love just to turn the conversation towards your recent NFT launch, the Tensorians. Yeah. Just love to get your view on what the strategy there is and what benefit you think that that can have for your platform.
00:33:34.314 - 00:34:19.864, Speaker B: Yep. So to catch everyone up, we basically launched our own ten K PFP collection on Solana, called the Tensor units. And one thing that's special about this collection is that we basically created them as compressed nfts. And so again, another tangent. Compressed nfts on Solana is basically a way for people to create a million nfts instead of for, you know, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars can now create a million nfts on Solana for less than $100. And that has massive implications to what the, what the feasible design space is for digital assets going forward. You could do so much more if it only cost $100 to mint a million nfts.
00:34:19.864 - 00:34:53.244, Speaker B: We're huge believers in the tech. And so you want it to be one of the first, if not the first, to create a ten K PFP collection for compressed NFT. So that's like the one that's. That's one reason why we. Oh, that's a small reason why we did it, is to prove out the idea that you could create a ten K PFP collection with compressed nfts. The other piece of that is, is we essentially saw how powerful the dynamics are of having an NFT community behind a product. We saw that with Haiti swap and abcs.
00:34:53.244 - 00:36:01.750, Speaker B: We saw that with backpack and mad lads. And so we wanted to essentially inherit some of the benefits of having a super vocal, highly engaged community behind our product that has, you know, some sort of, some sort of asset that we issued to them that tells them, like, hey, you are a super fan of tensor. We like, you come use our product, come show our product for us. Like, you know, we're able to do a lot of cool things that we couldn't have done before. So one thing is, like, we're able to, we did this a couple of days ago, but we're able to airdrop a bunch of rewards to all of these holders and all of our super fans without having to try to figure out, like, okay, let's have, you know, without having to, like, have some sort of, like, survey on our website asking people like, are you a superfan? How much soul are you trading on tensor? We can just, like, instantly identify everyone who's a believer in tensor, who's a believer in our community, and be able to do fun things with them. I think in the future. Like, like, these guys are basically our, our most vocal and organic ambassadors.
00:36:01.750 - 00:36:30.044, Speaker B: I think that that's something that's pretty powerful when it comes to growing a consumer app that is in a hyper competitive space like the NFT marketplaces. And I think if we have right now, it's, I think 2000, 3000 unique holders. If we have eventually 10,000 unique holders who are constantly telling their friends about tensor, why it's the best marketplace on Solana, I think we're off to the races at that point.
00:36:31.464 - 00:36:54.124, Speaker A: Were there any challenges with doing this? You mentioned it was a CNFT compressed NFT, which I believe it's the first mint I've heard of, at least at this scale. For a CNF NFT on Solana. I did see tweets at the time when it came out with some people, the airdrop maybe didn't go as they had hoped. Were there some kind of challenges initially to get it off the ground?
00:36:55.974 - 00:37:05.230, Speaker B: So one thing that we basically ate glass for the two to three months before doing this collection.
00:37:05.302 - 00:37:05.814, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:37:05.894 - 00:38:16.914, Speaker B: And that was because we wanted to be the first to enable trading for compressed nfts on Solana. We saw how much potential there was in the value prop of compressed nfts, which is that you can mint a million of these for $100. And we wanted to quickly seize that opportunity to become the first, you know, the premier NFT marketplace for trading these, trading this new standard. And so we had been doing, like, two to three months of glass shooting, just building out parts we needed for a marketplace. We started doing airdrops for a couple of creators, and that's how we sort of, like, learned the ropes of, like, how do you even do a massive airdrop with compressed nfts? And then, of course, we essentially dog fooded an NFT, like, candy machine, like a compressed NFT candy machine with our tensorian mint. I think we obviously ran into a couple of, like, minor issues early on, but ultimately, we resolved them. I don't think there's anything inherently difficult about compressed nfts and working with them, there is a slight learning curve, because they have to do things slightly differently than how you would with normal nfts.
00:38:16.914 - 00:38:26.174, Speaker B: But to me, I don't see there. I don't see any strong technical blockers to using compressed nfts over regular nfts.
00:38:27.274 - 00:38:59.342, Speaker C: And I saw that. I think you made reference to it, but I think you used all of the mint funds, is that correct? To then buy nfts and then send it to reward people? So, I mean, that's the first point. Then the other question I had was, were you rewarding people that were holding the nfts? And then were you rewarding them based upon the amount of volume that they were doing on tensor? Or was it just based on the number of nfts? Yeah. So, just interested to see how you're thinking about rewarding users and NFT holders.
00:38:59.398 - 00:39:48.506, Speaker B: Yep. So, talking about the controversial airdrop that we did a while back, it got a lot of good and bad takes on twitter, as well as in our discord. So the facts are, early on, before we even decided to do the tensorian mint, we knew that one, we didn't want to charge for the mint. We wanted this mint to essentially be free for everyone who wanted to mint a tensorian and who basically accumulated a bunch of tensor points from season one and two so that they could essentially mint a tensorian for free. Um, part of that was we added this very small mint fee to minting the tensorian, which I think was 1.69 sol. But we had full intentions of basically giving that all back to tensorian holders after the mint.
00:39:48.506 - 00:40:18.726, Speaker B: And so, in our mind, we thought that doing a. An airdrop was the best idea that we could have done with. With the buttons. Right. We would essentially sweep a bunch of nfts from all the collections that we partnered with in the past. So one that helps them essentially get a bunch of attention, get a bunch of new users, like, essentially receiving their nfts and potentially joining their communities. And so, like, one, that was great because we could give back to all the creators that worked with us.
00:40:18.726 - 00:41:16.706, Speaker B: And two, you wanted to show, like, hey, we're not using these mint funds for ourselves, right? We don't need these funds. Tensor is a very profitable marketplace. We have a ton of funding, a ton of Runway to continue building. And the mint funds were, was basically just a fun thing that we wanted to do so that we could do this massive airdrop event. And so airdropped all of these nfts that we swept to everyone who held a tensorian. So someone who didn't list it on the marketplace, who didn't list it on tensor for sale, and someone who didn't loan it out for an NFT loan, we basically airdropped all these NFTs to people who were holding tensorians at the time. The one thing that got a lot of controversy that we found out after the airdrop was that because we couldn't buy at least one NFT for every single tensorian who held it in their wallet, so, basically, 7500, and I believe we ended up with 2300 nfts that we swept.
00:41:16.706 - 00:41:50.596, Speaker B: It meant that 60%, 60, 70% of people didn't get anything. And, you know, the optics of that is pretty bad, because we said we were doing an airdrop to all tensorians. But, of course, it's a raffle base. It's a chance based event. You had a 30% chance of receiving an NFT, and if you happen to be unlucky and you had, like, let's say, five tensorians, and none of them ended up receiving an airdrop, then you might be a little, you know, annoyed, frustrated that you didn't get anything. So we learned from that. You know, next time, let's not.
00:41:50.596 - 00:42:06.344, Speaker B: If we say an airdrop, let's not do a raffle based airdrop, because people who don't get anything will be frustrated. And perhaps we could have made it a much, much longer event where it wasn't just a once and done flash in the pan airdrop.
00:42:07.724 - 00:43:05.282, Speaker A: I mean, to yourself, if it makes you feel better, that is basically how all mints used to work before, because you would just not get the mint, because all the bots and stuff would flood, and basically, only a small percentage of people would actually achieve it. So that's a very hard problem to solve for. I think what you guys did made a ton of sense, and I applaud you guys for doing it and shipping it, especially just learning this new standard of compressed nfts and getting it working in the entire product and then making the NFT itself a CNFT super cool. One trend on that point that I've noticed with you is almost doubling down on Solana ecosystem, picking up all the latest innovations that they put out there, like cnfts. How do you see Solana comparing to these challenger l one s, or even just eth or the l two s, like base? How do you see that shaking out in the long run? And is that something you guys are considering to potentially expand beyond Solana?
00:43:05.458 - 00:43:39.034, Speaker B: So for us, we're fairly first principles thinker. And so I'll come out and say that we're not at all Solana Maxis, but we are ux Maxis. We are like technology Maxis. And the reason why we gravitated towards Solana was because, one, it had the most promise of becoming the chain to essentially enable mass consumer adoption. It had the cheapest transactions at the time. Once you get below a certain threshold, its all the same. Its potato, potato.
00:43:39.034 - 00:44:51.096, Speaker B: Anything below a fraction of a cent, its basically the same two. It was one of the only chains production at the time with that cost of transactions that actually went through the trials and tribulations of running a chain. Solana went down a couple of times, but that only happens when you have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of users trying to submit transactions to your chain. Doesn't happen on a dead chain. And we saw that as a positive signal that people were coming back, showing up using Solana every single day. That being said, a lot of these up and coming l two chains, even new l one chains. I heard there's Monad, which is trying to build essentially the Solana before EVM based, like you mentioned, that Coinbase is doing like we're open to building on those chains if it means, if there's a good reason, if there is a vibrant NfT ecosystem that is being bootstrapped there, and we see that people want to trade the nfts that are being minted on base, that are being minted on aptos, that are being minted on sweep, then it might make sense for us to, you know, essentially build a product for those chains.
00:44:51.096 - 00:45:08.664, Speaker B: That being said, we haven't seen anything like that outside of Ethereum and outside of Solana. And maybe a couple of the other app like app chains, like flow. We haven't really seen anything like that for a really long time. So for now, we're Polygon. Yep.
00:45:08.784 - 00:45:11.644, Speaker A: Ordinal sort of until, though, not so much now.
00:45:12.584 - 00:45:52.136, Speaker B: Yeah. And the thing you mentioned about ordinal is, is very interesting because it was hyped quite a lot early on. There was a ton more volume on ordinals compared to Solana, but eventually it faded out. And I think that the reasoning there is like ordinals, like the tech itself, doesn't actually provide a unique user experience that Ethereum or Solana already offers. It doesn't provide anything differentiated. It's basically just the same thing on a slower chain with higher fees. And people are trading this because Lindy effect, or it's on bitcoin where all the money is.
00:45:52.240 - 00:45:52.832, Speaker A: Yep.
00:45:52.968 - 00:46:22.366, Speaker B: That being said, if you think about all the capital that's on bitcoin right now, I would reckon 80% of it is locked up in some hedge fund, locked up in some asset management institution, or locked up in Grayscale's bitcoin trust. And it's actually passive capital. Right. It's not going to. People aren't going to start buying nfts from an institutional hedge fund. And we, like that was our first principle of thinking that order knows, yes, there's more capital on that chain. We don't think it's.
00:46:22.366 - 00:46:25.394, Speaker B: It offers anything differentiated from Solana. Or.
00:46:33.694 - 00:47:13.644, Speaker C: What do you think is going to happen with the Ethereum NFT ecosystem? Because obviously they've got these expensive nfts which live on the l one, and I'm sure that the owners of those would want to keep it on the l one, despite the fact that fees are probably going to get pretty expensive during the next bull market. But obviously there's a long tail of cheaper nfts. And if those fees start going up on the l one, probably most people are going to be priced out. And yet it's not quite obvious where that would actually migrate to. And maybe that's the problem you have when you're fracturing it up into loads of different l two s. So how do you think that's going to go? Or do you think that the long tail will move to Solana?
00:47:14.424 - 00:47:14.736, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:14.760 - 00:47:16.124, Speaker C: Do you have a gut feeling on it?
00:47:17.384 - 00:47:58.874, Speaker B: Yeah. There are multiple things I want to say with that. The first thing is, I think bridging NFT is extremely difficult. And I think it's actually, it's actually like net negatives for someone to bridge an NFT from Ethereum to an l two. And the reason is you can actually fungibly settle these nfts like you would with tokens. You can't have some counterparty that will take the risk of let's say, giving you essentially a loan of Ethereum on Polygon and letting you like, be able to use that Ethereum on polygon instead of waiting like three, four days, wait like, maybe not Polygon, but let's say one of the roll up chains. Yeah.
00:47:59.174 - 00:48:00.094, Speaker A: Base or something. Yeah.
00:48:00.134 - 00:49:14.874, Speaker B: Can't use an NFT unless it's completely settled on that l two, because they're non fungible by nature. And so someone can't take the risk of essentially giving you out a loan that you can use that, use that token or use that NFT ahead of the roll up schedule. So I don't think like, bridging nfts will ever happen on Ethereum. Two, I think Ethereum will end up differentiating itself when it comes to nfTs, differentiating itself as a chain for essentially the collectible nfTs, the status symbol nfTs, where fees don't really matter if you're trading those items right. I don't think someone is like fussing over $5, $10, $20 in gas fees when they're trading a $100,000 board ape, as long as that board ape is on Ethereum still and isn't being bridged to some random l two. That being said, I think Ethereum, where it lacks in, and where I think Solana really shines and differentiates itself, is, like you mentioned, the really cheap nfts, that individually they're probably not worth it relative to the Ethereum. L1, gas fees, but in bulk, they still can account for millions, if not tens of millions of dollars in volume in market cap and value.
00:49:14.874 - 00:49:38.194, Speaker B: And I think that's where Solana would differentiate itself is with these really cheap nfts that are used for consumer use cases, for example, like chat stickers or massive art airdrops. That's sort of like what drip does. I think that's where Solana will shine, and I think that's where mass adoption happens for nfts is on Solana.
00:49:38.814 - 00:50:18.914, Speaker A: Let's talk about that a bit. What do you think is the key? Or maybe there's more than one, but how do you see NFT adoption really ratcheting up? And I'll preface this by saying, and I think we're all kind of in agreement on this, that era where the thing to do is just trading valuable nfts back and forth. That doesn't feel to me like what's going to happen. I mean, it will still happen, but not at the same scale when the next kind of mainstream bull market comes through. But you mentioned things like chat stickers. Obviously, people talk a lot about how nfts could be used in gaming. What sorts of adoption vectors do you see being really powerful here?
00:50:20.174 - 00:51:11.894, Speaker B: I think you mentioned some of the bigger ones. Utility and consumer apps like chatstickers will be huge. Utility in games or gaming assets will be huge for nfts. I think one thing that is, one trend that we're starting to see come out is actually using nfts as almost like an acquisition tool where you can convince people to download your app. You convince people to show up every day to do these daily streaks in order to get one of these compressed nfts, or almost like a collectible. Think about the Reddit avatars. It's very similar to that in that instead of buying these Reddit avatars, maybe you get the chance to earn one of these Reddit avatars by posting more on Reddit, by engaging more, by posting quality content, you have some score that is determined by how many upvotes.
00:51:11.894 - 00:52:03.764, Speaker B: And of course, most of these assets will be worthless. They're going to be a penny, maybe in a fraction of a penny. Most people probably won't care for them. They won't buy them, sell them every single, every single day. But if you get a super rare Reddit avatar or you get some super rare collectible from this platform that is growing exponentially, and this is a collectible item in the eyes of everyone who uses the platform, then, hey, I mean, you've basically just essentially like earned money as a user for using the product because you could sell this to someone who wants to pay a higher price for it. I think that's, that's a very powerful use case for NFTs that we haven't seen in the last cycle, just because the tech wasn't there, just because the economics of creating NFT was. But like I mentioned earlier, compressed NFT sort of unlocks that.
00:52:04.264 - 00:52:39.554, Speaker C: It's interesting you use Reddit as an example because they do basically incentivize exactly that behavior, but they do so with moons, their token effectively. So do you think that NFTs could start replacing tokens effectively as a reward symbol? Because obviously tokens, I suppose, at least it's a linear distribution, whereas nfTs, as you said, you could end up with something which no one really wants. So, yeah, just wondering, do you think it's coming in to replace the token reward meta?
00:52:41.174 - 00:54:14.040, Speaker B: I think practically tokens are very easy to implement, right? It's one cheaper on literally every chain to create, like, to essentially, like, distribute tokens to individual users. Two it's easier to think about because you essentially have this in game currency, in platform currency, where you, everything is fungible, you can create a model around it, you can create an economy around it, and it's very well understood. Whereas I think nfTs, because we don't really anything like it in web two, it's a lot harder to reason about because as a platform, you don't know exactly how many nfts, what type of rarity distribution, how many nfts will you be issuing in the grand scheme of things. So implementation wise, tokens are easier. That being said, I think what differentiates nfts from tokens and why people even trade nfts to begin with versus tokens is that there's a highly emotional and social aspect to them that you won't be able to find with tokens. I mean, sure, people will rave about Dogecoin on Twitter and they might get emotional over dogecoin, but it's an entirely different experience when you see one NFT that you own that has a very unique image, basically a one of one unique image, and you get attached to that emotionally, right? I think there's a word to it, endowment effect, where you get attached to something that you own and you value it more than something that you don't own. And I think that's what nfts essentially play into is the endowment effect.
00:54:14.040 - 00:54:33.124, Speaker B: And people get attached to it emotionally that you wouldn't get attached to a bunch of tokens emotionally. And for a consumer app, that is exactly the behavior you want from your users. You want your users to be emotionally attached to your product because that is what gives you your get it. That is what gives your product a moat over a copycat that does the exact same thing.
00:54:34.944 - 00:55:08.624, Speaker A: Yeah, it kind of reminds me of back in the days when I was playing runescape. If you were early and you got the Santa hat or the party hat, they were worthless. But then over time, the richest people in the entire game were the ones that owned those items from the early days that were around for that and collected them. Perhaps we'll start to see that dynamic play out with, you know, real world consumer applications and nfts that are issued. It's something to think about for sure, kind of. I mean, you've been in crypto for a while. You mentioned you got pilled in 2017, so you've obviously seen a lot of stuff.
00:55:08.624 - 00:55:17.624, Speaker A: What's exciting to you in this space outside of nfts? And maybe that's a hard question to ask because you're just so deep into it every day, but wanted to ask anyways.
00:55:19.644 - 00:56:55.784, Speaker B: It'S a hard question because I feel like I have a very layman's understanding of everything outside of nfts, and that I probably miss a lot of things that are super interesting that I frankly just don't have enough time to look into. I think what's exciting about, I mean, this is a pretty boring answer, but I've always thought about, like, okay, how do we, how do we onboard? How do we onboard, you know, the 7 billion, 8 billion people in the world, to start using crypto as the settlement layer, as the financial rails for everything, right? Like, how do we move essentially the entire world and the financial system onto crypto and build incentivization mechanisms to do that sort of thing, then thinking like, okay, how do you sort of, like, build a, what do you call it? Like, a venmo that's built entirely on crypto and incentivize consumers to use it? I think incentivization is a massive part of that. Kind of like what we saw with points on tensor, kind of like what we saw with points and blur. Um, I think there's something there where we can essentially move off of the archaic financial system that we have right now, where a bank transfer takes, like, four or five days if, if you happen to fall on a long weekend, which, you know, just happened, like, you know, just now, like yesterday, and being able to move everyone to the crypto financial rails so that we don't have to on ramp, off ramp onto crypto and just move to a better system.
00:56:57.364 - 00:56:59.252, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:56:59.308 - 00:57:00.904, Speaker B: It's kind of a boring answer, but.
00:57:01.404 - 00:57:49.794, Speaker A: No, certainly it's timely because the Solana announcement with Visa just dropped today, and that could be big for stable coins to make it just easier to move around with that as the rails powering those transfers. I think that's actually one of the main use cases of TrON, which has super high tvl and no volume because it's being used actually for people to send balances to each other on centralized exchanges and get dollar exposure. I totally agree. I think that could be a killer use case. I'm having this pain point today where I have to send someone money who's based in Europe. They're asking me to send it in revolut, and I don't even know what that is, and I've never, never used that app before. The systems, especially if you go across border, just so incompatible and hard to interoperate, and they have all this additional burden.
00:57:49.794 - 00:57:58.374, Speaker A: It just seems like crypto is a much, much more elegant solution to that problem, even if it is kind of a boring use case of just sending money around.
00:58:00.834 - 00:58:53.174, Speaker C: Just thinking about NFTs and the future of it, I think many people would agree it's going to move past ten k PFP, and maybe we're going to. It could even go into financial examples such as bringing bonds on chain. Or there's obviously the brand capture and various other strategies that people might use for nfTs, deepen being another one. How are you thinking about this intensive? Are you thinking that there's going to remain a pretty stringent art market, especially when people are receiving these things for free, probably in the next bull market? Do you think that's going to provide enough revenue for tensor and enough growth for tensor? Or do you think you have to try and position yourself really to capture some other markets, for example, bond trading, if that ever came on chain or something like that? How do you think about that?
00:58:55.054 - 01:00:35.874, Speaker B: I think to your point about bond trading, and I guess in general, like real world asset trading, I would imagine the thesis about verticalized marketplaces would be like a vertical marketplace for trading bonds, for trading real estate, for trading real world asset would work infinitely better than what we offer with tensor, just because there are a lot of things when it comes to trading different types of NFTs that we frankly wouldn't be able to build into our platform without essentially an exponentially growing list of items in our roadmap. Some people might want to see real estate nfTs, and you show every single property of that real estate backed or real estate backed NFT. There's a bunch of things that would, you would need to build into a platform that is ideal for trading bonds, for trading real estate. I think for tensor, what we're really digging into is sort of the user behavior and the user desire to, like, buy and sell things and try to, like, speculate on assets. I don't think we necessarily want to dig into any specific use case of nfts, like real estate, like bonds, like art, right. Ideally, you want to become the most comprehensive marketplace, the fastest, the most user friendly marketplace and platform to trade any nfts, if you're just there to buy and sell.
01:00:36.774 - 01:01:26.052, Speaker A: And so it seems like you're pretty bullish, and I'm too, as well. About one of the key things crypto does better than basically any other asset class is enabling not only the ability to speculate, but have it done in a financialized liquid way that's interoperable and permissionless. And it feels like tensor is kind of riding that massive unlock, specifically focusing on nfts. But I definitely think almost too many startups shy away from that when that's where we found initial adoption. And over time, it seems like you can unlock those more interesting use cases that are probably more utility driven. But it feels like doing that in the reverse order of operations might just lead to solutions, looking for problems, so to speak.
01:01:26.188 - 01:02:34.374, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're not opposed to exploring and enabling people to actually explore some of these sort of out there applications of nfts. In fact, like, one of the things that we'll probably announce very soon is tooling for creators to create nfts and specifically compress nfts. And so we want to be the ecosystem where you can do everything from creating, managing nfts on the creator side or on the platform producers asset issuance side, to the fastest, the most user friendly marketplace for trading these nfts. If you're on the trader or collector side, like the vision for tensor is an ecosystem where you as a collector, you as a trader, you as a creator, you as an asset issuance can go to one ecosystem, one stop, and do all of that without having to think about, okay, how do I create nfts on this launchpad and then get it into ten sensor? Should be a seamless experience across from end to end, and that's what we're really digging into.
01:02:35.474 - 01:02:53.054, Speaker C: And just maybe a final question for me, but just wondering, in the future, are you thinking about decentralizing the platform at all, or ways to use smart contracts to basically try and allow fees to reward users and people who are providing volume on the platform?
01:02:53.514 - 01:03:45.634, Speaker B: This is a tricky point because there are a lot of legal blockers for us, like what we can say publicly. But I guess, speaking in a general sense, we do want our protocol to be decentralized in the long term. We want our protocol to be frozen immutable to the Solana blockchain. So it essentially becomes part of Solana and then obviously managed the parameters, the fee settings, are all managed by people who are part of the tensor ecosystem instead of us managing it. So, Tilde, decentralized protocols, the platform itself, of course, is a little more difficult to decentralize because it's all like web two off chain code. It's like stuff deployed on AWS, which is, it's very difficult to decentralize AWS resources.
01:03:46.724 - 01:04:13.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel you on that, man. I'm using AWS for my stack as well. Well, Richard, this has been an awesome conversation. I do have one final question. I'm on your twitter right now, and one of your pin posts is kind of a reflection. So it's from September of last year. And so September of last year, you were saying, reflecting six months ago, I knew nothing about Solana or nfts, had zero experience with real time data pipelines, and didn't know Ilmoy.
01:04:13.878 - 01:04:28.914, Speaker A: Obviously, a lot of things have changed since then. I would say this past year has probably been way more kind of crazy and impactful. Are we going to get another one of those reflection tweets and maybe a teaser of it right now? I mean, how are you thinking about how the last year has played out?
01:04:31.654 - 01:05:05.562, Speaker B: I would say when I first got into web3, I definitely had very rosy glossy glasses for a very, like, optimistic view of the space. That's not to say I'm not. I'm not still optimistic about what this technology enables, what, what can actually be done with a blockchain that is completely decentralized? That being said, you know, for better or worse, like, speculation is one of the only product market fits we're seeing in crypto right now. Everything in crypto is about speculation. That.
01:05:05.618 - 01:05:06.194, Speaker A: Right.
01:05:06.354 - 01:05:36.274, Speaker B: Everything is encrypted is about speculation. But that's okay, because that's how we bootstrap all the builders. That's how we bootstrap all the early customers, all the early users to start using this technology and to actually build things on top so that, you know, once we have all the infrastructure ready, once the developer tooling is not, you know, crappy, once, once we figure out self custody, that is the pathway to unlocking, like, all the optimistic use cases that we envisioned early on.
01:05:37.574 - 01:05:55.470, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Speculations about getting butts in seats, people in the door, and building to that long term vision. Well, thank you so much for joining us, Richard. I know it's super busy for you guys out tensor, and we appreciate everything that you've done so far for not just the Solana ecosystem, but just all of crypto generally. It's been very impressive to watch.
01:05:55.582 - 01:05:57.354, Speaker B: Appreciate, appreciate you guys for having me on.
