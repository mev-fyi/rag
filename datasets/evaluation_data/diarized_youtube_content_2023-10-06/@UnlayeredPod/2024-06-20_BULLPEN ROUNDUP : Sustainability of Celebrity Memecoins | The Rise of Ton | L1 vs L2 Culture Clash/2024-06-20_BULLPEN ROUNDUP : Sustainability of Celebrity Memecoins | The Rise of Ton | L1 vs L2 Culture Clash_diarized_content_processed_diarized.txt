00:00:14.000 - 00:00:28.392, Speaker A: Welcome to unlair, the show where we talk about next generation blockchains. I'm your host, Dave, and joined by Sal and also Zen Lama this week, as we're going to just do a bit of a roundtable and get up to speed on all things crypto. So how are you doing, guys?
00:00:28.528 - 00:00:29.360, Speaker B: Doing well?
00:00:29.512 - 00:00:30.992, Speaker C: Pretty well. Pretty well.
00:00:31.168 - 00:01:00.394, Speaker A: Well, it's been a bit of a interesting market recently. Quite depressing on the timeline. Not sure how you're seeing at your end, but I think Ansem in particular is in the firing line right now as a result of celebrity meme coins. So maybe let's just start there. What do we think about celebrity meme coins? And is Ansem wrong to be encouraging this sort of behavior and bringing it to Solana? What do you think, Zen?
00:01:02.574 - 00:01:23.054, Speaker C: I don't know. I don't think it's, like, anyone's place to call anything wrong or right generally. I think it's pretty much on the celebrity themselves to do it. Right. Like, I do actually think iggy's pretty based. Yeah. Like, initially, I was like, okay, what? This is another celebrity.
00:01:23.054 - 00:02:09.530, Speaker C: And then I started, like, like, reading your tweets, and I was like, yo, this chick's based. So, like, now I follow her. I was just like, yeah, that's cool. So, yeah, I don't know. I honestly think, like, everyone who's, like, in the spotlight has, like, a villain arc, right? At some point when, like, the cycle turns, like, prices down, people get angry and start yelling about things. Like, even on the tech side, honestly, my feeds more tech oriented. And even on that side, it just feels like all the arguments are just recycled and the same things we've been arguing about all bear market, and there's just kind of less energy to argue.
00:02:09.530 - 00:02:57.558, Speaker C: It's like, okay, well, we've argued this for three years, you know, like, are we just gonna keep talking about the same things? Right? And the celebrity cycle, I think, like, feels a little bit to me, like, okay, like, you're just getting mad at people again for doing the same thing that people have done in crypto, like, time immorium, so, yeah, I. Like, I guess I just, like, I find it hard to place blame with any single one person. Right. Um, I do think, like, he's been pretty decent about saying, like, hey, if you're going to come into this space, like, you know, like, take some time to learn about it. Um, I'll be honest. I don't, like, follow enough of Ansem's tweets to have, like, the deepest opinion on every tweet. Right.
00:02:57.558 - 00:03:01.754, Speaker C: Um, but, yeah, like, generally, that's my feeling.
00:03:02.494 - 00:03:25.674, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, um, maybe we could start with, like, the exchange. The answer, Kobe exchange. I think good points were made on both sides. I think that there's a lot of negative attention directed towards celeb coins when on a long enough time scale, they're absolutely Netflix based. They just bring more people in. If you just boil it down to that, that's kind of what they do.
00:03:25.674 - 00:04:21.260, Speaker B: I think it's interesting that we celebrated musicians and celebrities and etcetera, oftentimes, jumping into nfts, you know, we had Justin Bieber bought a board ape, for instance, and et cetera, et cetera. There was a lot less negativity around it back then. But for some reason, because meme coins have this reputation for just being honest about not having utility, and oftentimes these projects don't have any sort of institutional backing. You know, it's a lot easier to point the finger and say, like, hey, they're promoting something that doesn't bring any value to the space. I think they do bring value to the space. There is a good point to be made that celebrities are only interested in extracting value and there's no risk to them. If they use their name to launch something that ends up going to zero, they'll still have their regular fans and a bunch of people might lose their money.
00:04:21.260 - 00:05:14.654, Speaker B: But clearly, this is kind of an oversimplification. And oftentimes what celebrities are actually trying to do is the exact thesis of nfts back in the day. And in my view, where meme coins are going, which is a vehicle to allow users fans to do things with the celebrity that's not otherwise possible or not easily done on traditional financial rails. And this is also where I think the discourse you hear on shows like chopping block, where they just completely miss the mark and they kind of, they don't really grasp what's actually happening here. Um, I see a lot of ivory tower syndrome with this topic. You know, comments from people like Hayden, people like Vitalik, all just kind of crowding into this narrative, saying it's. It's bad, it's stupid, it's a waste of time.
00:05:14.654 - 00:05:44.204, Speaker B: Usually the most interesting things that are built anger a lot of people, and they're. They create this really kind of whiplash effect at this course. So that's why I think this primitive is actually going to be one of the most interesting of the cycle, the most useful from a utility standpoint. So I'm pretty excited about, let's call them eccentric people or just generally the people that have been criticizing meme coins.
00:05:45.104 - 00:05:57.190, Speaker A: It does feel the longer that people stay in the space, the sort of more negative they become. You know, happened with the bitcoin maxis, and now we're sort of seeing almost ethics Boomer Maxis, who just sort of hating on anything, anything new that comes along.
00:05:57.342 - 00:06:02.438, Speaker B: They're hating it because they don't have the activity. If the activity was happening on Eth, they would only be celebrating it.
00:06:02.526 - 00:06:03.326, Speaker C: Yeah. Did you guys.
00:06:03.390 - 00:06:04.634, Speaker B: It's really that simple.
00:06:04.934 - 00:06:08.366, Speaker C: Did you see the tweet that was like, Solana should be made illegal?
00:06:08.470 - 00:06:10.954, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Shut down.
00:06:11.574 - 00:06:14.954, Speaker C: Yeah, it needs to be like, shut down immediately.
00:06:15.454 - 00:06:35.934, Speaker B: The moment any of this infra gets usage, because people are trading on it, then all the investors and such, they'll be singing the praises of these things. But because they're offsides of Solana, they have been for a year now. Oh, and all the actions happening on Solana. Yeah. It's time to criticize it. Right. And that's what I think is also playing into this, that people are talking less about.
00:06:36.874 - 00:07:29.574, Speaker A: But I mean, to play devil's advocate, I do think there's an issue, but I think it's a long standing issue, which is in crypto, whenever we have these, like, hyped launches. So we had it with icos, we've had it with hyped NFT launches, and now we've got it with celeb meme coins, which, of course, everyone's going to want to digen into. We're just, as an industry, not very good at creating guardrails, at creating apps which stop the person who's creating it from just stealing the money. I mean, the best we've come up with so far was NFT craze last cycle, where after a week, magic Eden would lock the Tokens post mint for a week, and then they would give it to the creators, at which point they would rug. So it's no real. It's no real protection. I remember Icos Vitalik used to talk about, maybe we should introduce these new types where the money gets locked up and then it gets released over a certain period of time, depending on if they've actually achieved certain objectives.
00:07:29.574 - 00:08:04.524, Speaker A: So I just feel like, because everyone's going to want to buy into these and because there's going to be a lot of celebs who are going to want to take advantage of that fact, I think it's dangerous at the moment, basically. And for what it leads to, me, too, is that I think we're on the cusp probably of some mega app, mega social app in crypto. And I really hope that we see it this cycle because there's a lot of interest in this stuff, but we just need the ability to stop celebs coming in and just taking that money out straight away. It should just be locked up or they don't receive any of the tokens. Instead they receive trading fees, things like that.
00:08:05.144 - 00:09:29.896, Speaker C: I mean, the technology exists. It could be locked in a streamflow contract. And, like, honestly, one of Iggy's tweets was pretty based about, like, her, like, wallet. She was like, I can't touch that money. Like, the, you know, like, the social aspect of this and building the brand and everything I'm building around this is more important than, like, the LP pool that's there or that wallet, you know, which is like, kind of how you would want people to look at this, know, like, when Dapp launches an LP pool for their token, you're not sitting there going like, oh, they might just, like, sell this, all right? It's there for liquidity for their product, for users, right. To, like, enable trading. And so I do think, like, we just need more people who are thinking like that and looking at, like, honestly, like, I think calling cryptocurrency like, cryptocurrency was, like, probably the fundamental sin, right? Because now everyone thinks of it as just like, a monetary instrument rather than, like, a social coordination like, mechanism, right? And so, yeah, but at the same time, it's like, what did you think would happen when mass consumer apps came on chain? Like, if you look at the content we see on, like, tv and radio and everything, like, this is the content that sells.
00:09:29.896 - 00:09:40.234, Speaker C: Like, this is mass consumer stuff. So I don't know. Yeah, a little bit. It feels a little bit like high horse like this. This is what pop culture is.
00:09:40.814 - 00:10:29.404, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. This is just a manifestation of what's going on in society. We're bringing culture on chain. But I think there is one pernicious thing about meme coins which you didn't have with nfts and didn't really have with icos, which is that they can just buy up the tokens straight away from other accounts and then tell everyone what the contract address is. So with that way, the reputation piece semi goes away if you manage to keep those accounts disconnected, because people don't even know that you own however much percent of the token. So again, it comes down to, if you're going to have celebs launching this stuff, it's going to have massive appeal and I think we just need an app with some guide rails just to stop the celebs taking advantage.
00:10:29.784 - 00:10:53.344, Speaker B: Right. Well, that stuff's not hard to do though. So one example, bubble maps is really good at showing you flows, right? Connecting wallets that's in disconnected, showing you the snipers what allocation they have. That's a few lines of code. If we can add it into what we're building at Bullfend and other apps can add it too. I think Pumpflon has it for all of their tokens, so those guardrails aren't hard to build.
00:10:53.924 - 00:10:55.324, Speaker C: We have the power.
00:10:55.484 - 00:11:00.476, Speaker B: I do think the form factor will change a little bit. I don't think it's just going to be people launching these things.
00:11:00.580 - 00:11:00.988, Speaker C: I agree.
00:11:01.036 - 00:11:39.264, Speaker B: Going at it, I think there'll be new, not new token standards, but perhaps taking advantage of what you can do with existing token centers like Solana Token 2022 with transfer hooks, or maybe having a more methodical way the mint event happening where it's not all done at once, where you can't kind of control for individual actors trying to accumulate supply, that this stuff can be innovated on at the product level to better align all the stakeholders. So we're just seeing like the very most basic experiments that is happening with this web coins. It'll get a lot more refined, I think, pretty quickly.
00:11:40.204 - 00:12:41.784, Speaker C: I do have a question, like, do you think. I think last cycle, right, for NFTs, right, there was the most basic form of the NFTs, the ten K PFP. And it was kind of in this similar, just like launch, get the money, there's a project meta and it never really progressed into everything. Everyone. You'd be on late night spaces talking about NFTs and be like, oh, it's going to represent asset rights and it's going to give you access to all these things. And then ya, and ya, and ya. And I guess I do wonder a little bit like, is this like meme coin meta gonna stop there or are we actually going to take that next step? This cycle feels a little bit like, okay, no one invested in apps and now we have all this infra and are we actually going to take that next step? Are we going to build these things that are clearly possible with the technology we have today? I would be interested to see someone do that.
00:12:44.144 - 00:13:16.904, Speaker B: The biggest blocker is just awareness, especially amongst bigger personalities that are not in crypto, that can bring in a lot of pension, which is why I think it's so important that you welcome these new users with open arms. Crypto is very small. It's pretty irrelevant if you look at it in the grand scheme of things. I don't know, isn't the market cap of crypto smaller than Nvidia at this point, or it's on par. We need way more people touching this stuff. Every time I talk to a normie about crypto, they seem afraid of it. It's completely unapproachable.
00:13:16.904 - 00:14:03.192, Speaker B: So the last thing we need to do is just continue whatever it is that we're doing now, which is pontificating about mev infra L2, layer three, and start actually just running more experiments, even if they're not all going to go perfectly well, as we've seen this past few weeks. But there are going to be some small victories that can compound over time. And that's also why I like that meme coins and fungible token standard over nfts. They're simpler than nfts, but they accomplish a lot of the same things. Can we make this even simpler for people to understand? Last cycle, you never really heard of a celebrity going minting an NFT on their own. They would have to get an artist. They have to come up with a concept, do all these steps, and then put out a collection.
00:14:03.192 - 00:14:17.004, Speaker B: Now, the barriers to entry just got ten to 100 x smaller. We can make those barriers to entry even smaller, while hopefully building in some sort of incentive alignment mechanisms as well.
00:14:17.344 - 00:15:03.654, Speaker A: Yeah, it would be great to introduce a bit more utility to these meme coins, I think, for sure, because for the longest time, it's been hard to actually add utility to crypto because worries about regulation. But it feels like if the utility is access to a celebrity or access to be able to buy tickets early, it doesn't feel that that's anywhere near sort of security level because you have those things in web two anyway, so I'd love to see more utility being brought to this, and also I just love to see more apps. I think it has been a pretty disappointing cycle so far with just the dearth of apps. And Sal, I know obviously you've raised money for your own app and you've gone through that process, but I'm imagining it's because it's been so difficult to actually raise money for apps. Certainly during the bear market.
00:15:04.314 - 00:15:44.464, Speaker B: Yeah, no, literally VC's didn't allocate to apps at all. A year ago, we even had podcast episodes where the ratio we heard was six to one. Infrared apps. I think that'll change now just because there's way too much infra, and it's completely undifferentiated. Like almost universally undifferentiated, where one l two versus another. If you're a developer, you are never going to anytime trying to decide if you should build on base versus blast versus linnea, et cetera, et cetera. Developers are very lazy and they want to actually build something useful, so they'll just choose the shortest path, which I think today is Solana.
00:15:44.464 - 00:16:10.800, Speaker B: There's users, there's liquidity, there's dexs, there's everything you need. There's information, there's data. You can get all that wrapped up in a nice API served to you. Put it in your front end, you're not going to bother messing around with all of these l two s. So I think now the money will start flowing downstream to the applications. Over abundance of infra, under abundance of apps, a lot less competition in apps, frankly. These days, there's just not that many of them.
00:16:10.800 - 00:16:14.844, Speaker B: And it's complete reversal from where we were last year.
00:16:15.784 - 00:17:32.853, Speaker C: I think even just here at Monad, we're seeing, you know, we have good tech, but, like, the main reason people want to come over to Monad is community, not tech, right? They want, like, users. Like, quite frankly, like, they want users for their apps, right? They want a community of people ready to use their apps, you know? And, like, as much as the tech is a differentiator, like, having a community of excited people ready to use your app is just as big as a differentiator, right? And over, you know, like, l two s and this and that. And we were talking a little bit before the show how, like, I do actually think it's a little bit dangerous to call everything ethereum, right? Because, like, social communities kind of need their own identity. You know, like, Monad started building its identity, like, well before. Traditionally, you would say that it was, like, time to do so, you know, launching a product. Yeah. But at this point, we have, like, fantasy creatures, like, just being popped up from the community randomly and it's like, hilarious, you know, and, like, looking back, it was like, probably the best thing we did, right? And it's just like, wow.
00:17:32.853 - 00:18:21.342, Speaker C: Like, you know, people just want to actually build somewhere where there's, like, people excited about what's going on and that they kind of have a cultural identity or could see themselves, like, being part of the culture, right? I think Ethereum, in the early days, that was ethereum, right? Like, Ethereum started as a monolithic l one, right? And everyone was there. The culture was there. The crypto culture was there, you know, uh, Solana is a monolithic l one. Like, they went through, like, the collective trauma of FDX and everything together that just, like, bonded the chain like none other, you know? Um, and now Monad, like, we've. We started building it, like, a year ago, if not more. And we look at all the l two s and, like, you know, like, the tech will get there eventually. Like, I do think Monet is better tech anyways, but, like, they don't.
00:18:21.342 - 00:18:39.624, Speaker C: At least I haven't seen an l two besides maybe blast with, like, a real standout culture. Right? And so, yeah, I think that's actually, like, kind of under indexed and current circles.
00:18:39.924 - 00:19:15.872, Speaker A: I feel like it's almost diluted with the l two s because there's one of 51, of 100. And so all you're ending up on most of these chains is, like, mercenary air droppers. And it's very, very difficult if you know that there's another 510 15 coming up where you can also do exactly the same. It's so, so difficult for anyone to actually stay put in a particular ecosystem. Whereas when you're on an l one, as we've had with Solana, we've had this sort of airdrop season, but people are staying. They're not generally moving on to the next chain, because you're in this walled garden, and you generally want to just keep your assets there. You don't just keep hopping around.
00:19:15.872 - 00:19:44.974, Speaker A: So, yeah, for me, it just lessens it a bit. Whereas I think Monad, being an l one l one s, tend to have always created these huge communities. And I think Monad as well, it benefits from being more of a shiny new toy than an l two does. Even if you built Monad and you could make it an l two, it still wouldn't be quite as exciting, I don't think, as being a standalone l one. So, yeah, the culture layer is real.
00:19:45.094 - 00:20:01.134, Speaker C: Yeah. I honestly think it's probably the most important layer, to be honest, because at the end of the day, cryptocurrency is social coordination. So you need the social people wanting to coordinate to make it useful. Like, otherwise, what do you got? You just got a coin.
00:20:01.994 - 00:20:18.974, Speaker B: How do you think that scales over time? I mean, we already saw with Ethereum, it essentially just fragmented into gazillion l two s and execution environments. And I feel like it kind of lacks. Maybe it doesn't lack it, but it's not as strong as something like Solana.
00:20:19.994 - 00:21:20.548, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, like, I honestly think taking a page out of Solana's book is not a bad idea in the sense that, like. Like, the culture on Solana is not about, like, some, like, narrow, technical, like, belief, right? Like, the culture on Solana was very, like, I'm here, I'm vibing, I'm having friends, right? And, like, I honestly think that's the secret sauce. Like, if, like, whether it's Ethereum, Monad, Solana. Like, if your friends are building on a chain, if your friends are transacting on a chain, that's where you stay, you know? Like, fundamentally, you're just like, the switching cost is high, and all my friends are here, so I'm gonna stay here. Like. And, like, I really just think it's that, like, it just needs to be a fun place to be, you know? And Monad's vibe is kind of, like, I think Solana is kind of maybe, like, the cool kid in the room. And, like, monad is, like, the goofy, like, fantasy child of the room, right? But it's fun, right? Like, I do think it's, like, wholesome.
00:21:20.548 - 00:21:57.844, Speaker C: It's cool. It hits a certain class of people the right way, and we'll see as we actually launch and more people come into the ecosystem, how that culture develops. But at least Ethereum, back in the normal days, at least everyone, this is before even I was in Ethereum. But when you talk to people back in 2016, 2017, they were like, oh, it was the cool, quirky place to be where the cyberpunks were, where things were being built. Right? And that definitely seems to have, like, switched to Solana now. Like, that's where all the cool things are being built right now.
00:21:59.024 - 00:21:59.360, Speaker B: So.
00:21:59.392 - 00:22:05.964, Speaker C: Yeah, like, I honestly think it's just, like, where my friends are at. It's, like, where I'm going to be.
00:22:08.304 - 00:22:35.262, Speaker A: Yeah. And again, on Ethereum, if you're on one evm, l two, your friends aren't necessarily all just going to stay there because they're probably likely to deploy across a load of different l two s. So, yeah, you're just sort of losing this locus of personality, really, around these altars, especially as we're going to keep on seeing more and more being deployed, more and more airdrops coming, more and more vc money being pumped into it.
00:22:35.438 - 00:22:58.814, Speaker C: And I do think, like, I actually do think eventually fragmentation will be solved. I think it's just going to take so long that they're going to miss the boat. Right. It's like. But it's kind of clear that there's this energy wanting social apps, wanting things to do on chain. And if it's another two. We were told l two s would be ready.
00:22:58.814 - 00:23:25.174, Speaker C: What? At the beginning of last cycle, it's been four years. Optimism just had implemented fraud proofs. How many more years for this ZK integrated stuff? You know, if it's another five years, like, the market's just gonna move, you know, and it's not that I don't think it'll be done. I just think, like, the market's gonna move. Like, the timing is gonna be off. Like, you need to be building for what people want to do today.
00:23:26.314 - 00:24:00.404, Speaker B: The other point is that scaling approach can be superseded by, you know, a new l one or ecosystem. Activists get a lot more users, like, in one snap. Like, ton kind of did this, where basically in, like, a few months, they got 40 million users. You can argue if they're quality or not, they're mostly click farming, but they're doing stuff on chain, and there's that many wallets made now inside of telegram. You can make the argument this will happen again with another l one or l two, and just kind of completely supersede what beef was able to accomplish in that time.
00:24:01.064 - 00:24:49.758, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I was using ton for the very first time this week, and his genuinely incredible. You're just on Telegram, and you create a wallet within Telegram app, and it all happened within, I don't know, 30 seconds or something, and then straight away you're playing these sort of mini games on Telegram. It feels completely different, completely different. And I can 100% see why it's got such a following now, why it's valued at about 25%, I think, of the market cap of Solana, and it may be, in my mind, I think, that we've got Solana, we've got ethereum. I think it's going to be really, really, really difficult for newer ones to come in. I think Monad's got the best chance out of all of them, and Ton's doing great. But I think it's going to be really, really difficult as we go forward for anyone to come in and disrupt these guys.
00:24:49.758 - 00:25:29.684, Speaker A: I think the only ones who can are most likely to be the guys with big, big distribution. If a Facebook chain, if a Google chain came in, would they be able to pick up a load of users on day one? The answer is absolutely yes. So I think that may be the way that it goes, especially if we start seeing lots of l two s being put up by lots of these big institutions. As we've always said, there's a strong motivation, if you're an l two, to become your own l one. So who knows what the future unholds? But I think distribution of these established trad five players is huge and could really come in and instantly become a big player.
00:25:30.384 - 00:26:03.666, Speaker C: I mean, I've always been worried about this. If Apple launched a blockchain, goodbye, it's game over. Everyone has an Apple phone in their pocket. They're not going to care if it's permissionless or not. If there's apps that are better because they're on a blockchain and it's powered by Apple, they're going to use it just like we saw with the, you know, they're doing the AI thing and they're building, like, the private cloud. Right. You know, yeah, it's probably not great that that's, like, private infrastructure is being, like, relied on by one company, but people trust them.
00:26:03.666 - 00:26:18.214, Speaker C: Like, they just fundamentally trust them and they trust them to have their opsec. Right. And everyone's going to use it. Right. And I think we see it with Tawn. Like, the thesis has played out, I think, two or three times now. Like, base got a lot of adoption.
00:26:18.214 - 00:26:53.414, Speaker C: You know, Taun has picked up adoption faster than almost anyone. Like, as a crypto native blockchain, I think distribution is, like, almost the key player. Like, I think the reason we're slated to do pretty well is because we started building our community a year, year and a half before launch. Right. Like, it really takes that and, you know, tan, I hadn't heard about it until you, maybe six months ago, 40 million users. Like, that might be the first blockchain with 100 million users on it. At that point, they could supersede everyone.
00:26:54.674 - 00:27:11.408, Speaker A: Is that right? Is that right? I'm still struggling to come to terms with this number. I knew that that hamster game had a huge number of users, but most people say it is just bots, basically. Or maybe it's that meme of the motorbike with, like, you know, 100 mirrors each with a phone on.
00:27:11.456 - 00:27:18.040, Speaker B: So, yeah, even if it's off by a factor of ten, that's still really material.
00:27:18.192 - 00:27:18.880, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:19.032 - 00:27:52.412, Speaker B: And so obviously, bullpen, we're a telegram mini app. There's not that many of them out there. And so it feels to me, this reminds me so much of apps on the iPhone in 2008, 2000, 920, ten when it was still really early, more like 0809. There's just so few out there. There's really not much to do besides quick farming, and it's going to get really sophisticated really quickly. What we're building is just one example of that 1.5 billion uses.
00:27:52.412 - 00:28:27.050, Speaker B: Allegram is just. It's just such a massive starting point to build a community through. The only achilles heel is the lack of support in the US and a lack of usage of telegram in the US. But besides that, yeah, I mean, these apps can and will get tens of millions of users. Just look at the USDT story, right? Like that launched that feature, launched tether on ton that launched permissionless and it's already at half a billion, I think in a few months. It's massive. It's coming up.
00:28:27.050 - 00:28:36.644, Speaker B: It's probably eclipsed most of the l two s at this point. People can use it to send money over text and that infrastructure can power so much of defi.
00:28:37.424 - 00:28:42.936, Speaker A: It's interesting what you say that. Is it completely banned in the US then? Because I had.
00:28:43.040 - 00:28:45.384, Speaker B: It's currently geofenced the wallet.
00:28:45.424 - 00:29:24.974, Speaker A: That is because it's interesting, isn't it, that people have said for a long time that we're likely to get geographically distributed blockchains basically. And ton therefore I believe has a really big following in the east, in the west. At the moment, I would say it's Solana and base probably would be the two big ones. But nothing on the scale, as you say, of ton of that sort of level of distribution. So it does make you wonder if one of the big us companies will come out and do a tonne basically for the western market and likewise have USDC as the. The dominant stablecoin, whereas I assume ton will be using USDT.
00:29:25.754 - 00:29:28.574, Speaker C: What would that be? That would be what, WhatsApp maybe?
00:29:28.914 - 00:29:49.444, Speaker B: Yeah. I just don't see it happening. I think there is no other messaging app that's at that scale that's willing to. That has such an open API for developers because we looked at all these. It's, you know, it's WhatsApp, it's iMessage, it's telegram signal, I guess. I don't know. I don't really think that's ever gonna via mainstream app.
00:29:49.444 - 00:30:09.664, Speaker B: I'm probably missing one messenger's own my Facebook. So that. That pretty much covers, you know, most of your bases there in terms of highly used messaging apps. WeChat's a chinese app. I don't see that being used in the west. And their API is not open. It's all owned by one company that, you know, government's trying to push, push out farther.
00:30:09.664 - 00:30:36.434, Speaker B: They're not trying to embrace. I put out a tweet that I think Telegram will start penetrating the us market relatively soon. The only caveat is just the high usage of iPhones in the west is the massive hurdle to overcome those blue bubbles on iMessage. But there is a non zero chance that that happens. And the only threat to me is Apple. If they somehow decided to embrace crypto. Yeah.
00:30:36.434 - 00:30:39.494, Speaker B: Then that would probably be the dominant blockchain.
00:30:40.634 - 00:31:10.262, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting. I don't know if they would though, because they'd have to. Like, they're really sensitive about opening APIs. You really can't do anything on Apple that they don't allow you to do. And so approaching blockchain, fundamentally is the culture of building on a blockchain is like, I want to be able to do anything with anything. And so that is a big leap for Apple culture. We'll see if it ever happens.
00:31:10.262 - 00:31:40.984, Speaker C: But I mean, kind of cool if it did, but my guess is it would not be permissionless. They're too big of a company to take the regulation risk for it. And it would probably most definitely be like a KYC chain coin would probably be USDC or some Apple backed stablecoin, and it would probably just get integrated into Apple Pay and things like that. Right. I don't think it would look like blockchains. We think today. I think it would literally just be like a.
00:31:40.984 - 00:31:51.284, Speaker C: A blockchain SDK kit for Apple developers that just links into their private cloud, but with ton.
00:31:51.444 - 00:32:17.094, Speaker A: So you're building on top of an app and using the APIs. But I remember reading in Chris Dixon's book, read, write, own, that inevitably all companies, once they get big enough, they start to close off the APIs because they want to capture more of the value and they don't want necessarily all the devs to be capturing it instead. So isn't this likely to happen with ton as well? Why do you think they would always keep the APIs open?
00:32:17.994 - 00:32:45.928, Speaker B: That's not going to happen for a few reasons. So Chris Dixon is not wrong. If you study what Facebook did, they used to have very open APIs. So the entire business of Zynga was built on this idea that you could message people like your friends, could dm other friends to hop in their farmville or whatever. That's why you'd get all those notifications in 2009. And then Facebook just turned that off. And that story has kind of repeated itself with lots of social networks over the years.
00:32:45.928 - 00:33:21.130, Speaker B: I think Instagram, I believe they initially built their social graph on top of Twitter's and then that got closed off. You can't do that, even Elon with Twitter. You can't actually look at who's following who over the API, unless you want to spend $43,000 a month, which is the cost for an enterprise plan. Telegram is interesting though, because it's a utility based social network, meaning they already don't really make any money. They just introduced ads for channels like two weeks ago. They're not driving tons of revenue and like an algorithmic feed, what they actually want is to encourage that behavior. And they don't even know what's going to work yet.
00:33:21.130 - 00:34:10.704, Speaker B: So they kind of have to just invite as many developers as possible to just coalesce around this ecosystem and try to be that base layer infra and monetize through alternative means. It could actually just be that, you know, tawn indirectly as a monetization vehicle for them through all the financial primitives that they can build and sustain. But I don't really fear like Telegram is such a, its ethos has always been that like anyone can build on it. Like the client is open source, you can look at all the code and kind of build your own version of telegram if you wanted to, the mproto client. So I would push back for that specific case against the notion that they could de platform or rug the APIs. The API isn't really anything crazy. It's literally just the ability to render a web page inside of Telegram.
00:34:10.704 - 00:34:35.102, Speaker B: That's essentially what a miniapp is. The only difference is you can just tap into the user session on Telegram and have them log in with telegram, that stuff. All the social media companies enable that today, even Facebook and Google. There's no upside in limiting that. I think that that risk is very much overblown. And you could also make the argument about all itself. They have created so many.
00:34:35.102 - 00:34:51.299, Speaker B: Not created, but they're the backbone of a lot of unicorns or launched in the app store. And yeah, sure, once in a while Epic will grow a fit over the 30% packs, but in aggregate, they generally haven't really change that much for developers.
00:34:51.451 - 00:35:02.771, Speaker A: How about the market cap of ton, do we think? Overvalued. Undervalued? And can it catch up with Sol this cycle? So it's about 20, I think it's about 20 billion from memory, and Sol's.
00:35:02.787 - 00:35:22.096, Speaker B: About 80 billion, if I remember correctly. I think it's, it's owned by not that many people. So that's the biggest issue with tons supply. They're trying to solve that. That's why there's a big sale, I think, to Pantera. That's a hard, that's a hard one. It's just such a different story.
00:35:22.096 - 00:35:55.844, Speaker B: Compared to Solana, in terms of how that project came to be, that predictions on market cap are a little challenging until that supply gets a bit more distributed. But in all, I'm pretty directionally I like where it's going. I don't think it's going to decrease. It is such a fundamentally just a different type of blockchain too, from just the architecture and what it can actually support. At a technical level, it's more of a distribution play. So yeah, I don't know. The answer is I'm not sure.
00:35:55.844 - 00:35:58.504, Speaker B: But I do think they're going to continue to grow.
00:35:59.204 - 00:36:28.414, Speaker A: We'll have to get someone on the pod to talk us through it a bit more. But you said about distribution of tokens. But of course, CZ, it was announced, I think, by Forbes this week, so it's not the most trustworthy source, but that CZ owns about like 55 60% of all BNB. So turns out that you can have like very limited distribution of the token and still get to a pretty almighty market cap. And a lot of people saying the only reason it's been ripping is because he can't sell while he's in jail.
00:36:29.554 - 00:36:32.010, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, it's like lower float.
00:36:32.082 - 00:36:57.324, Speaker B: So yeah, PNB is such an interesting story too, just because that coin is only relevant because of binance. And so it's hard to like reverse out the order of operations that story could ever repeat again. But I don't. I'm actually not that bullish. B and b, long term, I think that that style of coin is going to get superseded by newer experiments.
00:36:58.224 - 00:37:03.004, Speaker C: What do we think of BNB generally without CZ at the head anymore?
00:37:04.184 - 00:37:26.414, Speaker B: Yeah, like Binance. I mean, it still used a lot, I guess. I don't think they have a great honchain strategy. I think binance smart chain is going to basically lose to ecosystems like Solana or BNB. Chain is, I guess what you're supposed to call it now. The sex is still used a lot. It has a lot of liquidity.
00:37:26.414 - 00:37:35.016, Speaker B: That's a hard one to overcome, but it doesn't feel to me like it's trending in a futuristic or future facing direction.
00:37:35.160 - 00:38:06.844, Speaker A: Yeah, far more bullish on coinbases approach about really going all in on base and their investment in circle and things like that. Whereas, yeah, BNB. It's interesting though, what you said. I always imagined that most of the value is derived from the l one premium, whereas I think you're suggesting it's mainly from the discounts. I think that holding BNB gives you on binance and obviously just having the biggest exchange in crypto behind it. But yeah, I think I'd always attributed it more to the layer one for some reason. But I'm sure you're right.
00:38:06.844 - 00:38:11.180, Speaker A: I'm sure most of that value is from the centralized exchange and actually wonder.
00:38:11.252 - 00:38:24.518, Speaker C: How the volumes of meme coin trading on binance are this cycle compared to last cycle, given that Solana has entered the ring. I know last cycle is all on bike.
00:38:24.676 - 00:38:27.122, Speaker A: Yeah, I think nowhere near would be.
00:38:27.138 - 00:38:57.554, Speaker B: The answer that, uh, you're talking about on chain volume, right? Yeah, yeah, I, I believe, um, excel on has already surpassed it in terms of where the action is happening. Yeah, I don't think it's pancake swap and all those, or I don't think it's as relevant now. You just never see it show up in, uh, chain agnostic tools like deck screener and, and so on. Dex tools like. I used to see that a lot more last cycle. Now it's mostly like Solana is kind of the base pair.
00:38:57.934 - 00:39:30.912, Speaker C: How do we feel about Solana value accrual now that we have a lot more activity? Like Solana has passed Ethereum and dating daily trading volumes, Daily Mav capture like fees, given all these things? Yeah, they do have more inflation, but over the long term, if theyre also getting more fees, if theyre also burning more Solana, if theyre changing the fee model, that could change very, very quickly.
00:39:31.088 - 00:39:38.568, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Inflation is something which they could just bring down tomorrow. If it went to a vote with.
00:39:38.616 - 00:39:41.424, Speaker C: No vote right now, its going to 1.5%.
00:39:41.584 - 00:40:19.788, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in 2031. But I think you have to be looking forward looking basically with these blockchains. And if you're looking at Ethereum, I think it's really hard to say that eth the asset is going to be accruing a huge amount more revenues for the foreseeable future because I don't think they're going to see a lot more on the l one. Justin Drake said on the bankless podcast the other day that everyone should be on the l two. So its all going to happen on the l two s. And as we know, very, very, very little of the revenue then goes up to the l one. So I think its almost like theyve now gone down a massive amount.
00:40:19.788 - 00:40:59.772, Speaker A: Its probably going to take them five or ten years before they can recapture all of the revenue that they would have had if it had stayed on the l one. Obviously its an impossible question because you couldnt have kept it all on the l one. Theres just not enough capacity, but theyre really sort of hindering their value accrual for the foreseeable future. So I think that Solana, for me, it's just playing out exactly as I expected. Lots and lots of very high number of very low value transactions, and probably majority of the value will come in mev, even though people don't like that. But it's just how these blockchains work. There is leakage, and it ends up with the l one token.
00:40:59.772 - 00:41:43.484, Speaker A: So I think it is going how I expected it to. And as a result, I think Solana could have greater value accrual and probably a higher market cap than eth, even if the Solana ecosystem is potentially even considerably smaller than the ethereum ecosystem, just because there's far less leakage within Solana. So, yeah, when people, all they can say is the inflation rate is super high, firstly, it's in line with Cosmos. I think he just borrowed their exact inflation schedule. And you never hear people complaining about the Cosmos schedule. And it's something which can just be changed at the drop of a hat, basically, especially now that the validators are more and more profitable.
00:41:44.024 - 00:42:27.144, Speaker C: Well, I thought it was very telling back when earlier in the bear market, the debate was, is value going to accrue to the settlement layer or the da layer? And they never talked about the execution layer. I thought that was very, very telling. I was like, oh, like, that's a blind spot. And in my mind, I'm like, it's definitely going to accrue to the execution layer. Like, where does the value in, like, a normal web two app go? You know, like, yes, Amazon Web Services does capture some of it, you know, but, like, most of it goes to Facebook, most of it goes to the apps, like, building on top of it. To me, it was just like always so obvious. It's like, clearly an execution.
00:42:28.374 - 00:42:54.394, Speaker A: Yeah. And they're offloading it. And I think in Tradfi as well, the clearinghouses get a very, very, very small percentage of the total revenue that's going through. And that's basically what Ethereum is trying to aim for. And Ethereum's take rate is like 100 times higher. So it's very hard to imagine how they're actually going to become this settlement layer of global finance when their take rates are at 100 x higher than the tradfi equivalent.
00:42:55.974 - 00:43:06.994, Speaker C: What do we think of the debate more generally, like, who won? And do you agree with the economic security as a meme argument that Toli made?
00:43:08.214 - 00:43:48.772, Speaker B: Yeah, basically. I didn't think it was particularly close I didn't think any of Justin's points were particularly strong. The moment you say something like, everyone should build on an l two, and then you just look at Coinbase taking home tens 50 million plus dollars of revenue from being the sequencer, the sole sequencer there, with no economic incentive for them to decentralize it. I don't really understand what the thesis is with ethereum at all, and I don't really, I still don't to this day understand what economic security means. If someone could define it in very clear terms, that would be great. But if you can't, that's usually a sign that whatever it is you're describing isn't real.
00:43:48.948 - 00:44:04.938, Speaker A: And I mean, he said the main benefits of economic security, which I think totally did sort of agree with at the end, is liveness and censorship resistance. But then at the same breath he tells everyone to move to the l two s, which almost universally don't offer censorship resistance.
00:44:05.106 - 00:44:28.274, Speaker B: It's one of those cases where you. He's like, do as I say, not as I do. Right. Everyone says that that stuff matters. But then when you actually observe actions taken by developers and users, they clearly don't care about that. So. Because if they did, they wouldn't be building on a centralized l two that has absolutely no path in the next year to decentralize any of its sequencer operations.
00:44:28.274 - 00:44:45.114, Speaker B: I just, I ignore it. I ignore what people say. I just focus on what are people doing on this chain or this ecosystem? Is it congruent with the ideals that they've been spewing for half a decade? No. So why don't they take any of that stuff seriously?
00:44:45.574 - 00:45:28.886, Speaker C: So Im going to take a little bit of the other side of this. So ive actually been talking to one of the fire dancer engineers and Im not going to name him, but hes actually a bigger eth ball on the long term timescale. And its really interested to talk to him because hes in the end state of ETh being this stateless ZK route. It is everything we would want in the blockchain. Right. And like, I'm like, you're right, but like the path to get there is so long that I'm not sure that like the market is going to wait around for. Right.
00:45:28.886 - 00:46:30.228, Speaker C: And especially with the economic security thing, like, I would actually say that I do think like it has some applications and in an eth centric world where everything's a bridge, I actually think it does kind of matter because in my mind, economic security, the main reason it's useful is if you have in flight economic value before settlement. Once you have settlement and it's written to the blockchain, you can't roll it back. At least for chains with non probabilistic finality like Solana or Ethereum. At a certain point when it's finalized, you can't roll it back. So what does it matter for the economic security but for an l two or a bridge, which an l two is essentially a bridge, that economic value before settlement is in flight. And so it needs to be secured by something. And that's where I think the slashing guarantees and stuff does kind of come in in this world.
00:46:30.228 - 00:47:17.848, Speaker C: So like from an ETh perspective, I think they're actually making a rational argument, right. In the sense that like, okay, if it's a world of like the ZK state route, and it's a world of where everything settles to it, and therefore there's like a lot of inflight value, like it does actually need to be secured while it's in flight. Right. And so in that sense, like, I do kind of like think there's a point there. I just think it's very detached from the reality of the market today. Right. And so I'm like, look, there is this like theoretical world where I think everything you say is correct, but it, like Sal was saying, if you look at the behavior of what's going on today, I just don't think that's the way that the market is moving.
00:47:17.848 - 00:47:23.804, Speaker C: Right. That's not the reality of like the landscape that we're playing in right now.
00:47:25.544 - 00:48:04.694, Speaker A: Yeah. And if it genuinely takes five years, as you say, I mean, Ethereum has been around five years and everyone says that it has unconquerable network effects at this point. So if Ethereum is really going to allow the competition five years before it can present a sort of unified roll up infrastructure. Yeah. It's hard, as you say, to see the market holding back long enough. Perhaps as we often say as well, the most bullish solution is some sort of very fast, probably highly centralized l two that just garners 90% plus of all of the attention. But then you're competing with all the vc money and the airdrops, etcetera.
00:48:04.734 - 00:48:34.512, Speaker C: So all the research for ETH is not like, it's not exclusive to ETH. Like any l one can use ZK, they can all implement roll ups. They can all use ZK. So it's kind of weird to me that that's the only solution. Sure. I actually agree with a lot of those thesis is, but I don't see why. I don't see why it's always framed as, like, a mutually exclusive thing, right? It's like you can have your cake and eat it too.
00:48:34.512 - 00:49:12.614, Speaker C: Like, in the same hardware advances that are going to speed up ZK are going to speed up non ZK chips. Like, AI is not afraid of hardware. They're going to make hardware fast, like, whether blockchains do it or not. And so, like, the same scaling solutions that are going to use hardware to, like, speed up ZK are going to speed up the non ZK stuff, you know? And then when the ZK math is ready, you can just apply it to the fast l one that doesn't use ZK. Right. Like, it all seems additive to me, so it all kind of, it feels weird when it's framed as, like a, like, a mutually exclusive kind of technology battle. Right.
00:49:12.774 - 00:49:19.714, Speaker A: Zen, I've just noticed that you're in, I think, the. The merch room. The Monad merch room. Is that where you're usually based?
00:49:20.774 - 00:50:00.952, Speaker C: Yeah. So I actually have moved to New York, so I'm on Brooklynite now. So I'm here in the monitor office. We're actually doing, like, a little, like, I guess we'll call it, like, our first, like, what would we call it? Maybe like a boot camp, maybe like an accelerator. Right? It's our, like, our testing ground, actually. Sal was invited to it because he's a, he's local here sometimes. And so, yeah, we're kind of just, like, bringing some founders together, some native teams on Monad, and, like, trying to spin up that founder builder community and, like, see how that gets going.
00:50:00.952 - 00:50:08.724, Speaker C: So it's been pretty exciting. So I actually like where it's going on right now. So I, like, locked myself in the merch room for this episode.
00:50:09.904 - 00:50:22.364, Speaker A: Now it sounds sort of like Solana early days with the hacker houses, which I think were just sort of put together by developers at a conference, is what I remember Toli saying. They just did a sort of side event, basically.
00:50:23.944 - 00:50:41.392, Speaker C: Yeah. I think we're just, like, learning. Like, we wanted to keep it pretty. Pretty low key. Right. It's kind of like our own testing ground. Like, how are we going to run these things? What's the vibe? You know, how do we scale this up? But, no, it's pretty exciting.
00:50:41.392 - 00:51:30.838, Speaker C: Like, there's definitely apps that are here that I'm pretty excited about that I'm like, oh, this is cool. So, yeah, honestly, I'm excited to see that energy come, especially coming from the Solana side. One thing is incredibly clear when you go to Solana hackathons is people are product focused and shipping focus, and it is cool to see that energy starting to come out, especially just today was the first day I had my first office hour with the team to go over their technical architecture and their app, and I was like, damn, these guys are building something cool. And it was just cool to see. It's like, okay, maybe we're getting back to some real building culture here on the EVM side.
00:51:31.006 - 00:51:34.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to see fewer charts on the timeline and more apps.
00:51:36.684 - 00:51:38.344, Speaker C: Very dull. Ask actually.
00:51:39.804 - 00:51:52.388, Speaker A: Well, I think we want to try and tag on some fun little thing at the end, but I think maybe we've run over time, so maybe we should leave it for next time. But yeah, I think it's been a great chat and look forward to doing it again. Hopefully next week.
00:51:52.476 - 00:51:52.924, Speaker C: Sounds good.
