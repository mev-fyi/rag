00:00:14.280 - 00:00:37.196, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we explore next gen blockchains. I'm your host, Sol, alongside my co host Dave. And today we're chatting with Ryan Connor. Ryan is a researcher at Blockworks. He's very familiar with the podcast circuit. He's co host of one of their shows and expert on a lot of things in crypto, which we're going to get into throughout this episode. But first, let's just start with Ryan.
00:00:37.196 - 00:00:39.640, Speaker A: How's it going? How are you feeling about this market?
00:00:40.820 - 00:00:59.650, Speaker B: Oh, geez. Well, first off, good. Great to be on. I've been a listener since day one of the pod. I think what you guys are doing is really great. How am I feeling about the market? It's certainly over. No, no.
00:00:59.650 - 00:01:40.860, Speaker B: So for like the first seven years of my career, I was a macro investor, very focused on short term timeframes. Sub one year. I'm doing my best to reorient myself and I've done a really good job of that over the past few years and thinking of on longer time horizons, being more fundamentally oriented. So im doing my best to not know the price of bitcoin. Its below 60. I know that much. I know Germany is selling, but I think when the biggest piece of bad news is that a big person is selling or whale is selling, it could be worse.
00:01:40.860 - 00:02:08.586, Speaker B: Its not a massive leverage unwind. An exchange hasnt committed fraudhead. The government isn't cracking down on all the crypto on ramps and off ramps. Things could be much worse. So long as we're not having a recession in the US, which the macro data is softening, but it doesn't look dire. I'm cool with it. Volatility is a gift of the bear.
00:02:08.586 - 00:02:10.030, Speaker B: Market is going to continue.
00:02:10.650 - 00:02:15.970, Speaker C: The bitcoin selling as well is at least finite. At least there will be an end, right?
00:02:16.750 - 00:02:37.250, Speaker B: I agree. It's hard to time these things. I haven't been in crypto for too long. I really started investing in the space in January 2021. That was kind of mid cycle. It certainly wasn't early. There were three months before and then you had defi somewhere, obviously that where crypto really ripped.
00:02:37.250 - 00:03:08.440, Speaker B: If you're getting in that late to a cycle, you really have to time things. I think you really have to be focused on timing. Whereas investing through the bear, this most recent bear, like you're fine. So long as you had one or two winners, you're fine and you're happy with your cycle returns and you really don't have to play this game of hot potato that I think everyone who's been getting in over the last few months has been playing. So as long as you're not playing that game of hot potato, I think, I think you can just write it out.
00:03:09.900 - 00:03:33.360, Speaker A: Looking out though, do you think? Or rather I'm seeing a lot of discourse on the timeline where people are no longer interested in any alts. They just want to hold bitcoin, Sol ETH and everyone's really bearish on valuations. They're bearish on the fact that meme coins get all the attention. Are they right or do you have another take here?
00:03:35.240 - 00:04:34.430, Speaker B: I think that when people look, when you lose money, you become apathetic and it's hard to like what's going on in the market. And I think that a lot of what happens in like the CT discourse is that retail comes in after the coins are already ripping, buy some coins, they see some gains, but then the pullback inevitably happens and like frustration occurs. The other interesting thing about this cycle I think is that a lot of people were probably over allocated to eat and it's done absolutely nothing. And that's really frustrating for something that was like such an obvious winner right this cycle. Um, that I could see that as a huge point of frustration. Like you're also seeing the l two valuations like really come in. Like blast is super interesting on like a price to fee, like from a price to fees perspective, that thing is the cheapest thing in crypto.
00:04:34.430 - 00:05:10.510, Speaker B: Obviously the TVL is going to come in, the fees are going to come down and we have to wait to see whats going to happen after farming. The full effects of that farming subside. But those l two valuations are disappointing investors now as well. So I think its really easy to get apathetic. However, I mean there's a lot of really interesting things happening in crypto. I think that meme coins are. I think that that space in the market is super interesting and investable.
00:05:10.510 - 00:05:46.120, Speaker B: I think that the crypto AI intersection in the way that it's changing markets. There are a lot of opportunities there. I think in the deep end space you have a few protocols that can generate real revenues that are trading at meaningful or, sorry, realistic valuations that arent crazy like everything else. So you really have to pick your spots and this pullback is going to give people the opportunity to do so. So if you got some cash like I dont see like theres no reason to be down on this market right now.
00:05:47.190 - 00:06:29.446, Speaker C: I feel like a lot of the apathy which is currently in the market is outside of bitcoin. Ethereum and Sol. It's very hard to see how value from the actual protocol relates to the token price. You're just talking about the l two tokens. I think the reason they're not doing very well is because obviously there's this large overhang, so there's lots of tokens coming onto the market, but it's also the fact that the value isn't accruing to them. Even in something like deepin, there should be some value coming in, but again, it's not very clear. So are we not at risk of just ending up in this very apathetic place where, as we've been saying, people are just in the big three, they're probably in meme coins, because at least it's honest about what it's trying to do and everything else.
00:06:29.446 - 00:06:36.170, Speaker C: We need to wait for regulations potentially, until actual value can accrue to those tokens. What do you think about that?
00:06:36.630 - 00:07:35.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's hard to argue with that. Um, I think that, look, the, everyone's talking about the ETH ETF right now, and a lot of people think like that opening up like that avenue to like the wealth channel and the asset allocator channel is going to be bullish for that token. I think that like, that's going to disappoint some people too, right? Like first the timing is like really poor. They're opening up, they're saying like hey, come invest in this new product to tradfi. When tradfi's on vacation, like it's July, it's August. Like every managing director is going on vacation. Like, you know, you have summer Friday, it's like volumes do experience seasonality here.
00:07:35.170 - 00:08:34.070, Speaker B: And they really compressed so much so that tradfi investors do not take price action as seriously in July and August as they do in other months. So I think that theres the possibility for disappointment there. I think that it isnt obvious that this ETF actually fits into investor portfolios right now either. So if you think of like if you were an asset allocator coming into 2024 and you wanted a crypto allocation, um, you didn't expect that ETH was going to get an ETF, right? You thought bitcoin was coming, but eth you had written off, Gary wasn't going to allow it then Gary surprised markets. So let's say you bought the bitcoin ETF on day one. It's appreciated like two x since then, at least 50%, right. And you probably topped up that allocation for the year.
00:08:34.070 - 00:09:31.212, Speaker B: You're over allocated right now and then you get a surprise. With the ETH ETF coming to the market, you don't have the space in your portfolio for that asset. More importantly, look, a lot of these asset allocators, they allocate on a very like using modern portfolio theory, right? It's all about the return enhancing characteristics of the asset in relation to the volatility and the correlation with the rest of your portfolio. And ETH is highly correlated to bitcoin. And over the last year or more it's underperformed. Like it's not exactly clear that ETH adds diversification and expected return benefits to a portfolio for a tradfi investor, especially when theyre over allocated. So you talk about crypto investors being disappointed.
00:09:31.212 - 00:09:54.140, Speaker B: Theres not a lot of value out of there. The one thing that the market is hanging on is this ETH ETF. And I think that at least in the short term, it may disappoint some people as well. So its like if were thinking short term, how do we want to think about this market? Im more optimistic about q four than I am the very near term and maybe q 125.
00:09:55.280 - 00:10:26.978, Speaker A: It seems like a lot of people are agreeing with and aligning with that timeline. From what Im seeing, I have no idea. I do agree though, summers tend to be a bit slower, just for a lot of reasons. So I think by late fall we should probably see things start to pick up, hopefully. So let's get into Taun. This is something that blockworks put out a research report on. Interestingly, it was a bearish research report in some ways.
00:10:26.978 - 00:10:43.900, Speaker A: I think it kind of dampened a ton of excitement for the tan ecosystem. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I think this will make for an interesting conversation. So what is your high level take on tan?
00:10:45.560 - 00:11:43.670, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think just like objectively, tan Coin and the tan ecosystem are two of the most interesting things in crypto today. Tan coin is interesting because the valuation is so high and the tan ecosystem is interesting because they have this very unique relationship with a gigantic web two company that seems to really want to integrate it into its business. That is objectively very exciting. And in the report, like we go over the bull case, we do not dismiss it. Like the bull case is the bull case. You've heard it from every research shop, multiple investors like a lot of monthly quarterly commentaries. Distribution is the most powerful force in finance, in technology markets.
00:11:43.670 - 00:13:17.800, Speaker B: Arguably its the reason why Apple was able to flip a switch on the phone and enable payments and generate $2 billion in revenue within 24 months. Its how Microsoft was able to whittle away at AWS market share because they had pre existed pre existing distribution on prem with enterprises. My teams best at Slack, even though Slack is just objectively better, Microsoft has distributions into enterprises. Similarly for TaN, this distribution relationship that it has with Telegram is objectively very powerful. Telegram is one of the most used apps globally from an MAU perspective. And because they're so prominently featuring this like wallet within the application, it's not unlikely that people are going to click that wallet and see what happens, right? So there is a very strong case to be made that like the distribution, Telegram's distribution is very powerful and therefore bullish for Tan. The other interesting thing about the bull case is that sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly, we're talking a lot about WeChat and Telegram becoming a super app, an app of applications, a platform for developers to build on and then get that distribution.
00:13:17.800 - 00:14:09.456, Speaker B: But I think that when like that's from a very high level, all those things are true. When we dig below the surface, there's some nuance there that's important to consider, especially in light of the valuation, which again is very high. So from a distribution perspective, first, Telegram's distribution is Maus is not the best way to describe it or it's not the best measure. So when I think about messaging apps, messaging apps are like integral to day to day life. They're integral to us personally and professionally. And the way that I bet Telegram is thinking of this internally is from a DAU perspective. But apps publish Maus because Maus are always bigger.
00:14:09.456 - 00:15:04.320, Speaker B: So from a DaU perspective like that, that's like your monetizable user. That's where you can really drive revenue growth. And the interesting thing about Telegram in the context of the greater app ecosystem is according to data from similar web and very other sources, Telegram's daily active user to monthly active user ratio is very low for a social or messaging app. Now, like there's some assumptions in that calculation, we're relying on private estimates from similar web. But apples to apples, you can see that social apps will typically have like a ratio between 40% to 80%. Daus to Maus telegrams is like 15 or 20%. So the penetration in my view, like you need to adjust your valuation for that potential penetration or monetizable user that Telegram actually has relative to other apps.
00:15:04.320 - 00:15:30.730, Speaker B: The next kind of important note on the distribution, in my view, is that we're making all these comparisons to WhatsApp in terms of distribution. But Telegram's distribution is extraordinarily fragmented versus the distribution of, let's say, WhatsApp. So WhatsApp sold or funnels users into a very single homogenous market.
00:15:30.830 - 00:15:32.190, Speaker C: You mean Wechat, I think.
00:15:33.130 - 00:15:55.370, Speaker B: Sorry, wechat. Wechat. Sorry about that. Into a single homogenous market. Mainland China is known to be one of the easiest markets to navigate because it's culturally and linguistically homogenous. If you look at Telegram's distribution, eastern Europe and APaC X China are its two biggest markets. And there, like, distribution isn't as straightforward.
00:15:55.370 - 00:17:14.850, Speaker B: So if you're a developer and you're thinking about using Telegram as a distribution platform, it's not 900 million, right? Like, you have to make choices around the language that your app appears in, your comms, your sales, your marketing, and then the people that you hire boots on the ground. To sell that app, you have to make those choices. And based on those choices, the distribution is much lower. So the 900 million, I think, overstates it because the real, like, the boots on the ground fact of the matter is like, you have to pick a submarket, and the submarkets within Telegram are much more fragmented than, let's say, wechat. The last kind of like, issue that I see with the bull case unrelated to distribution is this like, fun C developer paradigm where like, look just from a high level, you look at Solana using Rust. Rust is not the most widely used language, but is a very admired language. It has a very enthusiastic following.
00:17:14.850 - 00:18:07.670, Speaker B: You look at solidity, which looks a lot like JavaScript, and it's a very widely used language. So onboarding there is a little bit easier. But if you look at Func, it looks a lot like c, and it's not particularly admired or widely used, according to developer survey. So that's like, it says something about developer onboarding. Now that's certainly a, like, you can do something about that, right? Like you can make, you can develop tools that make that experience easier, and they are attempting to do that. The problem is that what we see, and this is like publicly available information, you can see chatter on Twitter about it. There are l two s raising some of them evm l two s on tan to solve that developer friction point.
00:18:07.670 - 00:18:49.042, Speaker B: And if you are building an l two on tan, like, to me, that's a value capture problem for the tan ecosystem, because the l two is going to own that relationship with that EVM developer. It's not going to be taun coin, it's not going to be the tan chain, right? So, um, when Tan is used as a settlement layer instead of an execution layer to solve those frictions around fund C. Like, you have to question the amount of value accrual to ton coin. And look, every, every investment should be taken in context of price. If, like, I. I keep saying this, and it's a. It's a wild example to illustrate the point.
00:18:49.042 - 00:19:20.232, Speaker B: If tan is one 50th of the price today, it is a massive buy. Like, I think all of us put a significant portion of our wealth into it, but it's not. It's trading at 950 times fees. I think the median l, l one or l two token is trading at 500 or 600 times fees. Solana is trading at 130 times fees. Arbitrum is trading at 100 times fees. The growth is priced in.
00:19:20.232 - 00:19:39.020, Speaker B: So it's not a secret that Tan coin exists and it has this distribution relationship. Again, it's that price tag that I think is the biggest strike against it in context of these nuances around ecosystem fragmentation and the problems with func.
00:19:40.850 - 00:19:55.710, Speaker A: Lot to unpack there. So let's start with. With Val, because I think that's one of the key drivers of this thesis. Tan's trading at about $18 billion market cap on an fdv basis.
00:19:56.650 - 00:19:57.058, Speaker C: 40.
00:19:57.114 - 00:19:59.674, Speaker B: I think it's about 36.
00:19:59.762 - 00:20:49.690, Speaker A: 36 ish. Okay. So with respect to time, I think, I don't necessarily disagree with the fact that it's very heterogeneous distribution. Users are in a lot of different countries that all have a lot of different cultures. But what you're seeing, though, in spite of that, and a good proxy to see how popular some of these mini apps are, is to look at how big their channels are. You can look at this data, the top ten or so biggest channels. I think eight or nine of them are all mini apps that use taun in some capacity or going to integrate taun at some point, maybe launch a token on it or what have you.
00:20:49.690 - 00:21:19.510, Speaker A: A lot of them are these click farming games, which some are proclaiming is a spiritual successor to play to earn. I don't disagree with that at all. I think there's a lot of similarities there, and these numbers are staggering. Hamster combat, 48 million subs in their channel. Tap swap, 25 million subs pixel versus 10 million subs, not coin, 8 million subs. These are astounding numbers. These are theoretically net new users into crypto.
00:21:19.510 - 00:21:59.362, Speaker A: I've always held a thesis that the easiest way to onboard someone into crypto is to not make them use crypto, at least not in the beginning. Do stuff off chain, but roared them on chain for sticking around and for doing things, the right user behavior that you're trying to incentivize. And those numbers are insane. And I think they kind of maybe weak, perhaps weaken the argument that people using Telegram aren't as engaged. And 900 million users monthly active, I believe, is overstated. I mean, these numbers are nothing that easy to hit. Certainly they're maybe 100 x bigger than the number of people that use something like Farcaster or whatever.
00:21:59.362 - 00:22:12.150, Speaker A: Name your popular classic consumer crypto app. So maybe let's start with that. What do you say to the insane adoption metrics around some of these mini apps?
00:22:13.610 - 00:22:47.430, Speaker B: I think that when things are financialized, people do their best to farm the thing. I don't know how many real life users hamster combat has. I know that they've claimed in their public comms to have 250 million users. I know that you're saying on the channel there's 48 million. Look, it's a very low barrier to entry to click the thing. I've tried it myself. I didn't stay around for too long.
00:22:47.430 - 00:22:49.010, Speaker B: I didn't see the utility.
00:22:50.230 - 00:22:53.662, Speaker A: Oh, there's utility. There's the game.
00:22:53.846 - 00:22:54.598, Speaker B: There's the game.
00:22:54.654 - 00:22:55.942, Speaker A: We should probably do the game too, right?
00:22:55.966 - 00:23:00.294, Speaker B: The gaming is that you click until you get to a point and then it resets your score.
00:23:00.342 - 00:23:15.420, Speaker A: And then it's like a really, it's like a really crappy version of like Street Fighter. It's basically you have these two pets and you have to click a different zone and you have a health bar. I was playing some random person on it. It was interesting.
00:23:16.240 - 00:23:53.080, Speaker C: Could it not just be a new form of mining? And I appreciate that. I think the issue is that you're not really having to put anything to stake, and therefore it's just infinitely. You can sibyl it basically. But could this not just be mining for a token which has had a fair release and become sort of a mimetic or store of value or something like that on the ton ecosystem? Because in your report you completely ruled out tap to earn as a. A future area. And I probably agree with you, but I think it's just worth the intellectual exercise to see whether it has got any legs.
00:23:53.420 - 00:24:33.902, Speaker B: Yeah, the friction to playing is very low. And I guess the friction to therefore having fun, assuming that the game is fun, is very, very low. So that's great. At the end of the day, I am skeptical of the amount of users. Just like that 250 million person number in context is greater than the population of Russia, which is the number one country using the Telegram app. So I'm highly skeptical of it. I wonder the stickiness of this kind of onboarding to crypto, like giving out phantom money to get people to onboard onto wallets.
00:24:33.902 - 00:24:55.876, Speaker B: Because I don't think that axie infinity, like, was sticky for the people in the Philippines that were using, like, that system. I don't know. Do you guys know the daily active numbers on Axie Infinity? It would be interesting to know that and then try to reason about how many people stuck with crypto because of that. I don't think that it's much.
00:24:55.988 - 00:25:18.504, Speaker A: Well, I think Axie is just interesting because everything was liquid right away, so you couldn't control the market. They were kind of subject to terror. Luna. Same with Stepn, in some ways. Whereas these games, they actually don't give you anything, at least to begin. Some of them haven't launched the tokens yet. You're just getting points or whatever you want to call it for those specific games.
00:25:18.504 - 00:25:51.396, Speaker A: One other interesting metric, though, is let's take Pixelverse, for example. They have 9 million subs. Their YouTube channel gets 2 million, 4 million views, um, their official channel, that is. And there's no economic incentive to watch a video. Um, so I suspect these numbers are actually more real than people are giving credit for. I also don't think it's particularly easy to Sibyl Telegram. This is mostly anecdotal, but I've tried making multiple telegram accounts before, because for testing stuff on bullpen, we're a telegram miniat.
00:25:51.396 - 00:26:29.080, Speaker A: And, uh, I had to, like, like, if you try to use Google voice or something, it'll get banned, like, within a week. Uh, same thing happened with one of our engineers. I had to actually get another phone and set it up that way, and that's the only way I was able to persist my second telegram identity. So I think they've put in a lot of effort, the telegram team that is in, because they don't want a bunch of spammy users. They're a normal web two messaging platform. They want to keep it as clean as they possibly can. I think they invested a decent amount of resources in preventing this, which is actually why I'm extremely bullish on Telegram and Tanzan, because they've done a lot of this heavy lifting for us.
00:26:29.080 - 00:26:43.080, Speaker A: All the developer has to worry about now is just, can you get your app to work within the context of telegram? Lean on some of the primitives they've built. Lean on their onboarding, and it seems like it's working in some ways.
00:26:43.900 - 00:27:13.582, Speaker B: Yeah. The coolest thing about telegram is that the telegram bots that crypto has like the successful ones have really printed, right. Like they've generated like real revenue. There's something to say about minimizing that like trading UI down to like a messaging format. I think that's super interesting. Look, I like strong opinions held loosely.
00:27:13.726 - 00:27:14.518, Speaker A: Sure, sure.
00:27:14.614 - 00:27:48.960, Speaker B: Like if not coin rips or, or, sorry, if the project, like if the fundamentals compound, if we start seeing like real apps being built, if like the l two thing is figured out and than is more of an execution layer than a settlement layer, like think about that investment very very differently. At the end of the day, to me it all comes down to price. And you could assume that ton fees two x over the next twelve months, which they very well could like. That is, that is priced in today.
00:27:49.420 - 00:27:49.844, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:49.892 - 00:28:22.614, Speaker B: And in a mid bull market environment, like your margin of safety on that investment, like you have to trade it, you have to be in and out because your margin of safety is very low. Like in a, in a bear market, which we will inevitably have again like tong coins going down 50% in that environment. That's just like beta, that's table stakes. We'll put out a piece and reevaluate that thing. If the valuation makes sense in context of the kind of boots on the.
00:28:22.622 - 00:28:48.540, Speaker C: Ground fundamentals and also comparable prices is so important. And I think just as sole price is probably restricted by ETH, ETH price is restricted by bitcoin, I think Tom Price will be restricted by sole, and at the moment it's about 50%. I think it's pretty hard for people to say that this should be worth it any more than that, and potentially a bit less given the amount of adoption that the two have received so far.
00:28:49.280 - 00:29:25.172, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a fair bogey. People do look at those things. You have to take them seriously. I think the more interesting thing is I've seen plenty of back of the napkin analyses that take the 900 million number, they slap a conversion rate on it and then they scale up the tongue coin valuation by that in combination with some other metrics, and thats fine. But for a new buyer youre mid cycle, its a $40 billion valuation today. Again, the fees could two x youre still valued higher or in line with the market. Thats completely priced in.
00:29:25.172 - 00:29:44.210, Speaker B: What is the margin of safety for someone who has no exposure? Thats what BWR is trying, or blockworks research is trying to answer right now. If you dont have a position, does it make sense to ape in today? And the conclusion today is no. I'm excited for when that changes, because then we'll put out another report and reassess.
00:29:45.150 - 00:30:17.280, Speaker C: You also had an interesting piece in the report where you said that WeChat has its own dominant payment rail, and obviously telegram definitely doesn't have that. But in a world where crypto becomes the de facto way to pay people, getting set up this early, getting this number of wallets into hundreds of millions of people's hands, it has the opportunity potentially of becoming a dominant crypto payments provider. And then from there you could potentially leverage that position to monetize.
00:30:17.820 - 00:30:59.450, Speaker B: Yeah, it's certainly an important strategic asset. I think that payments are probably most interesting where payments are restricted because crypto in a lot of ways is a regulatory arbitrage on tradfi or regulations in Tradfi, just speaking facts, thats what it ends up being. A lot of the time in Eastern Europe, there are payment issues, you have multiple currencies, you have sanctions on russian citizens. It makes a lot of sense to circumvent that via crypto.
00:31:00.870 - 00:31:12.010, Speaker C: And I think India as well is another example. I don't know how big telegram is there, but I think it's difficult to get money out of India. So yeah, I agree. I think there's a big market for those sorts of things.
00:31:12.790 - 00:31:47.420, Speaker B: Yeah, totally not dismissive of it. Again, all these things are important. Web two relationships are important. They are like first, looking at this space, the most interesting thing about crypto from like a strategy perspective is like things are forkable. Like you can have your app, your contracts forked away and like the Sushiswap uniswap thing is just one classic example. It didn't ultimately work out for Sushiswap, but there was a real threat there. Web two, or like off chain relationships are emote.
00:31:47.420 - 00:32:05.160, Speaker B: They are a very important strategic moat and one of the very few that web3 native things have. So undoubtedly its a positive for Tancoin, but again, positive at what price?
00:32:06.660 - 00:32:44.520, Speaker C: I'm sorry, can I just say that I think it's appreciated during the middle of a bull market to actually see some bear case reports coming out because Massari released a report on ton yesterday and it covered the bull case pretty well, but didn't really touch upon the bear case at all. So I think it's good to see this and it's maybe strange that it doesn't happen so much in the industry, perhaps because people, maybe these research houses are getting paid to do these reports. I'm not really sure what the reason is, but why don't we see more negative, more bearish outlooks on assets as you would in tradfi.
00:32:46.040 - 00:33:34.980, Speaker B: I mean look, I think that statistically if you were to take the s and P 500 and you were to see over what timeframes the thing went up versus going down, its going up 80% of the time its going down. Maybe its probably less than 20% of the time it pays to be bullish. And when price is ripping in Tradfi as an analyst, if youre against that thing, you have a lot of career risk. I think that's pretty real. I think that the nice thing about crypto is that it's open. We can have these discussions continuously and you can update your view like very, very rapidly. So I don't know, maybe more analysts will see that.
00:33:34.980 - 00:33:52.210, Speaker B: So if you're an analyst and you see the bear case in time, but everyone is saying that it's obviously a bullish thing, like you can just hop on a podcast and change your view as the facts come out right. And these conversations maybe help push that forward.
00:33:54.190 - 00:34:52.540, Speaker A: A couple of other points I think we want to just underscore here with Tan. One is I think people are sleeping on stars, which could actually be a really cool entry point for net new users of taun itself. Essentially, stars are these, it's like a off chain currency of sorts in Telegram that you can buy or earn through Telegram itself. It's fully supported by the native in app payment system, Apple Pay, what have you, whatever device you're using. And developers will soon be able to kind of use those to essentially trade them for tokens on the TaN network and use that as almost a payment system. I believe telegram channels also owners can earn payments in stars between stars. And the fact that usernames are tradable, they're essentially tradable nfts.
00:34:52.540 - 00:35:29.020, Speaker A: These are two primitives, fungible and non fungible digital assets. That telegram is fully starting off as web two in an environment that people understand and enabling them to take advantage of crypto instead of starting the other way, which we've seen in every single cycle. This is NFT. Here's why you should care. These are just things that people already want to do. They want to trade usernames who want to earn the in app currency of sorts, and then you can bolt on the web3 functionality after the fact. I think a lot of interesting experiments will be run on those two primitives of alone.
00:35:29.020 - 00:36:09.388, Speaker A: And kind of the final point I'll make is, yeah, I agree. The biggest, perhaps risk or friction point is just the challenges of building on tan. And there is a bit of like they haven't been battle tested yet in terms of sheer usage. A lot of their activity, like we mentioned before, is off chain. The transactions aren't super complex right now, but I think that's a very solvable problem and I'd actually prefer people solving that later. Versus the current paradigm is VC's invest $100 billion in infra to scale blockchains and no one ends up using any of that stuff. Maybe we should start the other way.
00:36:09.388 - 00:36:58.750, Speaker A: And that's kind of what telegram's doing. They're in fact probably the only l one I've ever seen that is truly going the complete opposite direction from every other l one and focusing on users distribution, getting people in the door, and then they'll figure out how to make it more developer friendly. There'll be wrappers where essentially I think people will just be making smart contracts or whatever their business logic is with a different language like typescript or what have you. So I think that stuff gets solved over time. They're by far the most interesting, at least I've seen so far. Just in terms of the sheer consumer usage, the adoption in overseas markets, and the fact that it's already a juggernaut that has a lot of usage. That is, I think, the only web two social company that's using crypto in a serious way.
00:36:59.650 - 00:37:43.006, Speaker B: Yeah, it was super disappointing last cycle when Instagram announced that they were going to integrate like Solana and Ethereum. NFTs like that to me was a very significant moment. So if you're excited about the distribution that telegram has, you have to be, you know, Forex excited about the distribution that Instagram has. That was really disappointing. But they're focused on AI. They're doing their thing. Yeah, I think, look, the real challenge here is that we can talk about fragmented distribution or the challenges with fun C or whether or not Taungoin can accrue value if there's an l.
00:37:43.006 - 00:38:18.870, Speaker B: Two. The real kind of there is a pre established norm with OS level applications in the modern world today, whereas Wechat rose to prominence before that norm was established. A lot of developers, like the users, live at the OS level. And in a lot of countries outside of China, they're using OS level apps, not in app applications. It almost is an added point of friction. I love Telegram. I use it all the time.
00:38:18.870 - 00:38:54.814, Speaker B: I experiment with many apps whenever I can. But I do feel like this added point of friction to open an app and then go into another app. And from a cost per click perspective, there's some drop off there. WeChat had this very path dependent rise to prominence where that norm was not established yet in China of OS level applications. It'll be interesting to see if Telegram can break that. Like, you have to offer a really compelling experience to bring the user from the OS level to the in app level. Look, the product's awesome.
00:38:54.814 - 00:38:58.690, Speaker B: Can they execute on the new thing like, we'll see. I hope they do.
00:39:00.950 - 00:39:38.180, Speaker A: A lot of analogies there too, I think also chrome extensions which live in a browser. Granted people spend a lot more time in browsers, I think, than messaging apps, but there are some analogies there with respect to l two s. What is the actual value accrual mechanism for them? Because as I understand it, they're typically not used to pay gas, so there's no reason you really need the token. And as far as Mev is concerned, I don't think like a holder of an l two token would get any economic benefit from that. So how would you think about value accrual for l two s?
00:39:38.680 - 00:40:11.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not an expert on all the internals and l two s today. Like, I very much get my information from the broader blockworks research team. But the way I see it is that they're all chains with tokens. Like they can accrue value in the same way, which is through fees and Mev. Now there are problems when you have a, like a single box, when you're operating a single server and you're taking all the fees in Mevdeen. Right. It's my understanding that there are some money transmitter problems there, forcing people to use your token.
00:40:11.690 - 00:40:30.062, Speaker B: There's a regulatory barrier there. Let's assume that that goes away. I think it's the same as, and let's assume that you can decentralize this l two layer with shared sequencers or whatever. I think it still fees in meth. And that's the only way, because you.
00:40:30.086 - 00:40:39.568, Speaker C: Could decentralize the sequencer, not using a shared sequencer, but just decentralize your own amongst the token holders, as I understand. And then it would just operate like an l one.
00:40:39.744 - 00:41:03.910, Speaker B: Exactly. You just do the l one again and then you lose a lot of the benefits of the l two. So it's a rock and a hard place, right. But at the end of the day, it's all fees and Mev. And for simplicity, if you're taking this data from a high level, you should adjust it on a token by token basis. You should look at how they're accruing value. You should look at the bells and whistles that they're using and you adjust your model for every single one.
00:41:03.910 - 00:41:29.818, Speaker B: For now, these things are always in flux. They're changing from time to time. And there's this at the limit analysis where you can say regulations ease and where are all these tokens going to go long term? So it can get complicated. But for now, fees and Mev, that's your cash flow and slap market cap on top of that. And you have a relative value metric that you can compare all these things. Hmm.
00:41:29.994 - 00:42:09.420, Speaker A: But I was, I guess like, I think maybe we don't want to underestimate that Reg point, which is the tokens themselves are just like governance tokens. And so this is all theoretical like that they would ever get any economic benefit from fees or meV. So I don't know, pricing that risk. I feel like I just don't see a world where those are any more compelling than something like tan, for instance, which is a cleaner kind of set up there. It's a true l one. You do have to actually use it to do things. You can maybe stake it and then get exposure to the mev if the validator shares that.
00:42:09.420 - 00:42:22.700, Speaker A: I just never understood how that works for l two s. I mean some of them have native yield, I guess, but that's not super compelling unless, to your point, that can go up a lot as usage goes up.
00:42:23.200 - 00:43:07.066, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that in respect to the taunt question about is it going to have evm l two sde? Yeah, look, if there are evm l two s, like less mev flows to Toncoin, your fees flow to Toncoin. Like that gets figured out at the l two. So that really changes the value capture mechanism the same way it does for ETH today. If you look at ETH's revenues, like their highest month in revenues I think was November of 2021. 1.8 billion in fees and meth in the most recent month I think they made 160 million in fees.
00:43:07.066 - 00:44:07.284, Speaker B: And mev, like you have a 90% drawdown there and you're at like April 2023 ish levels on monthly mev and fees. So a secular decline because Ethereum has decided to outsource its execution to l two s. Thats a big deal. And the way im thinking about this, and this is, well see if this thesis plays out. But markets are a function of their participants, right? If you took three non financial people that dont know anything about companies and you had them trade these arbitrary stocks, and they were the only people trading them, the price action on those stocks would look like it would look nonsensical, right? Like you wouldn't understand why the things were doing what they were doing when they reported earnings or whatever. Because the people don't understand finance. They don't care.
00:44:07.284 - 00:45:24.680, Speaker B: If you had a bunch of hedge fund managers just trading those stocks, they would look much different, right? The price action would express the underlying beliefs of those hedge fund managers. In crypto, you're moving from a retail dominant, or over the last ten years, you've moved incrementally from a retail dominated market to an increasingly institutionally dominated market, where these tokens are starting to generate real cash flows. Let's say Trump comes into office and pulls back, or just sets a regulatory framework for these things. Institutions can now participate. Like when the marginal buyer is a guy with a CFA who has learned of cash flows all his life, and he finds out that eth token holders accrue cash flows via fees and Mev and Solana token holders accrue cash flows via fees and Mev, why wouldn't he use a price to cash flow measure to value these things and think about growth rates in that way? So as we move closer to that world, I think these measures are really going to matter much more so than they have in the past.
00:45:26.020 - 00:46:04.536, Speaker C: I mean, both of us have been talking about this for the last year or two. It's just insanity to me that people fight against it. But you recently did a really great tweet comparing Sol versus eth valuations. Basically, that Sol is on metrics perspective is in a much, much better position than ETH. And some of the pushback you got from that was people saying, well, ETH won't be valued on the fees it's receiving, the revenue it's receiving. Instead, it's going to be valued on the money ness of the ETh asset. But even that is something which I struggle with because post firedancer, the numbers, which now we're starting to hear from the fire dance team, is like 1 million tps within two years.
00:46:04.536 - 00:46:37.220, Speaker C: So even if eth has all of these l two s, and they're all using eth, unless the number of Tps going through all those l two s is going to be 10 million or a billion tps, which I don't think anyone believes that. I don't really see the difference in the moneyness argument just because ETH is being used across loads of different l two s versus just in Sol's instance, where it's just being used on the l one. So do you hold much credence to this moneyness argument. And do you think that ETH has a stronger claim to moneyness in the assumption that both of these ecosystems grow to the same size?
00:46:38.320 - 00:47:21.554, Speaker B: Yeah, kind of two points. I think that, first, anything that has cash flows will be valued on those cash flows, at least as a function of the valuation. Right. Like that is true. If Larry Fink comes out tomorrow and he references the price to sales ratio of ethnic, like, things are going to change. Second point, I'm willing, since I've held for a long time the view that nothing in crypto is even close to money. The BWR guy, like the guys on my team, they're all super smart, they've changed my mind on a lot of things.
00:47:21.554 - 00:48:27.100, Speaker B: Maybe they changed my mind on this, and kind of, I am moving slightly in that direction. But I think objectively, if you look at the market today, nothing is money in crypto. Nothing is even close to being money in crypto. In fact, crypto market participants have shown a, have a revealed preference for us dollars over BTC and ETH and Seoul and everything else as money. So if you look at, think back five years when you could go on binance, and there was a lot of trading pairs denominated in BTC, there were a lot of trading pairs denominated in ETH. The dominant trading pairs today are all denominated in USDT. USDC stablecoin volumes are up and to the right of, whereas listings, or as with BTC and ETH, as percentage of listings on trading pairs, is down and to the right.
00:48:27.100 - 00:49:11.266, Speaker B: So the market is literally choosing dollars over crypto assets. Even in the instances where it's like crypto is this regulatory arbitrage on the traditional financial system via payments, or like, um, you can use crypto to get around sanctions. Um, like Venezuela is taking payment in USDT. Like people aren't using bitcoin for that, they're using dollars. Like the reveal preference of, of people globally is that they prefer to hold dollars. They trust the us government more so than the local currency. And like, look, I think it's of strategic importance that the US really leans into that.
00:49:11.266 - 00:49:50.748, Speaker B: Like, who knows if they will. I hope that they do. I think that the way things are going with the elections, like thats probably possible, but yeah, crypto has very much a revealed preference towards us dollars over crypto assets. I think kind of like, the last point is that I kind of dont care that gas is denominated in ETH and Gwei. I think its irrelevant because although it is technically denominated in ethnic people, do not account for it in ETH. No one is wondering. Go to Coinbases ten k and their ten Q.
00:49:50.748 - 00:50:33.458, Speaker B: They say that they do not hold any ETH above what they need to operate the exchange that day. Then look at Apple's and Google's balance sheets, $100 billion in the USD. It's well above the operating cash that they need to fund operations. Right. So there's, there's a clear distinction here. Even if even go to like application companies on Solana or like go to deepen projects who need to hold Sol to transact on the Solana blockchain, they don't. They hold dollars and then they get the sole when they need it and then they transact there.
00:50:33.458 - 00:50:52.560, Speaker B: They're effectively denominating their gas cost in local currency and not the blockchain based currency. And until I see that changing, like, I do not buy the money argument at all. I think you are so far away from money, it's not even worth considering to be honest.
00:50:55.340 - 00:51:36.730, Speaker A: It's a fair point. Yeah. I guess it just depends on how your view of the dollar is over time. Not necessarily in the next 510 years, but the next 20, 30, 40 years. Will it be challenged? Will crypto subsume that? In some ways I think what you've seen with the movements on the petrodollar side kind of signal a more global shift away to de dollarize a bit. I'm not really an expert on that stuff, but it does seem to me like the risk of the dollar being less relevant is about as high as ive ever seen over time. But again, probably not a short term thing.
00:51:36.730 - 00:51:45.750, Speaker A: And I do agree most people still kind of prefer holding it in emerging markets and denominating expenses in it and so on and so forth.
00:51:46.770 - 00:52:33.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I think kind of two points there. The first is the historical perspective. Have you guys read the market wizard books? I forget the authors name. Basically market wizards, its like a three or four book series where they interview great investors about their careers and then what they think about going forward. Like what analyses did you use? And I dont know, hows the world changing? How is the world changing? How is the world changing and whatever. If you read the first Margaret Wizards book, these are some of the greatest investors in history. They basically say they are so scared of the us deficit, the dollar is in the weakest position its ever been.
00:52:33.480 - 00:53:04.154, Speaker B: I see a real crisis on the horizon with the ballooning debt load in the United States. That was 1990 and it never happened. When I first really started getting into macro in high school I was like, okay, I was in high school, granted, but I was pretty convinced hyperinflation was around the corner. Like Ben Bernanke was printing dollars hand over fist. There was a financial crisis in the United States. Like it extended to the eurozone. Like there was a, like there was, there were real risks there and there were.
00:53:04.154 - 00:53:58.782, Speaker B: Then there was experimental monetary policy. Didn't happen today. Like, yes, like you can point as like interest, you can point to interest expense as a percentage of like GDP. You could point to the use of the chinese yuan for global, or I think it's cross border payments has risen from 50 bps historically to as high as high 3% or maybe even 4%. But if you look at the debt to GDP ratios of these other countries, if you look at their monetary policies, if you look at their growth rates, United States is best house on a bad block. It's all about the alternatives there. And bitcoin cannot handle payments.
00:53:58.782 - 00:54:25.174, Speaker B: ETH layer, one cannot handle payments. There's a lot of friction to people actually using these things. And the revealed preference for, you can think of it in two layers. There's the government layer and then there's the citizenry. And the governments don't want us dollars. That's very clear. China wants control of their monetary policy and Iran wants control of their monetary policy and Russia wants control of their monetary policy.
00:54:25.174 - 00:54:59.410, Speaker B: But the people have a revealed preference for dollars and what's going to win out in the long run. I view these governments as super unstable, especially compared to the United States. The United States is not great today by any means, but it is relatively more stable than these governments. So I still think they have a leg up. I still think they have a leg up. The dollar is in the best shape it's ever been. The dollar is up since the lows in 2008, the DXY is up like 50% against a basket of competing currencies.
00:54:59.410 - 00:55:25.480, Speaker B: It's strengthened. When financial crises happen, the dollar goes up in value, not down, because there's a massive rush for dollars. Cause it's a safe haven. Still today when that changes, like I'm willing to change my mind, but I don't see that price action changing in the dollar and I don't see the revealed preference of the masses of people really changing.
00:55:26.580 - 00:56:06.740, Speaker C: Do you also think the recovery was helped by that sort of being the start of this tech phenomenon that we've seen over the last ten years or so? I think 2012, 2010 is when things really started to accelerate just after the credit crisis. And us stocks have obviously absolutely ripped I'm over in Europe where everything's been flat, currencies have been devalued, and so we're in this pretty depressing position. Whereas often people say, if we're going to escape from this downward spiral, then tech and innovation is the only solution that could pull us out of it. And I wonder if that did help the US over the last 1015 years.
00:56:07.710 - 00:56:38.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I think two things helped the US, and this is coming from a guy who used to do macro and no longer does it, because I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it anymore. It's like way too hard. But I think there are two big trends over that decade. I think one was the technology sector, it was software, and Silicon Valley was the place to do it. It happened in the United States. We had the venture capital, we had the mines, we had the universities.
00:56:38.180 - 00:57:05.220, Speaker B: It worked here, we had the developed capital markets. That really helped. I think the other thing that really helped is monetary policy. I think that we found out that printing just a little bit of money and buying just a little bit of debt over time actually really smooths things and minimizes a lot of risk. Central bankers, this is a super unpopular in crypto, and they'll mess up. Central bankers will mess up again. But they're the best that they've ever been.
00:57:05.220 - 00:57:32.332, Speaker B: They have 100 years of monetary policy experience. They have the most data that they've ever had. They have access to real time credit card data. They saw the mistakes that were made in 2008, and they saw the success of what Ben Bernanke was. They're getting really good at their job now. They are human. They will mess things up.
00:57:32.332 - 00:57:54.380, Speaker B: But every time something bad happens, we run to the central bankers and guys are on CNBC screaming like the Fed should do something. Then the Fed does do something. It opens up, swap lines, it buys back bad debt. And guess what? The financial system keeps going. They're getting really good at fighting recessions, and look again, they will mess up. But over the long term, I would not fade that.
00:57:55.880 - 00:58:28.650, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Let's pivot away from macro bit and talk about, I guess, the antithesis of macro, which is meme coins or attention tokens, I think is another way you describe them. They were all a rage this cycle. In some ways they kind of still are. Certainly. I think there's a lot of saturation now. And the main difference from this, compared to previous cycles, is just the ease with which one can deploy one for essentially no money, $2 or whatever, on pump fun.
00:58:28.650 - 00:58:32.170, Speaker A: What's your take on the state of meme coins?
00:58:33.550 - 00:59:16.730, Speaker B: Yeah, the state of meme coins. I think that they are the most accepted and simultaneously most hated that they've ever been, which I think is really interesting. I think that they are the defining, like, sub sector of this cycle, which, again, people really hate. But I think, and look, meme coin activity will fall 90% like it always does. That will happen in the next downturn. But I think that meme coins, I think the narrative gets it wrong in that they have had staying power. They are here to stay.
00:59:16.730 - 01:00:11.434, Speaker B: They are not ephemeral. The reason that I believe that is because to me, meme coins are like an extension of traditional gaming or, sorry, traditional gambling. So when I think about, like, gambling today, we all know that it's growing faster than GDP. We all have people in our networks that are using traffic and applications to gamble, like, quite often, almost on a daily basis. I think that the reason gambling is super successful today is because we are richer than we have been, just like globally. Maybe it's not as rich as we want to be, but people have more disposable income than they've had historically. And gambling, it fits into this app paradigm that gives retail users really short feedback loops.
01:00:11.434 - 01:00:52.750, Speaker B: So you can think of like an algorithmic feed or push notification, or this battle to minimize latency at the app layer. Like, short feedback loops create sticky retail users. I think that gambling apps today are successful because they allow individuals to return multiples on capital over those short timeframes, over those short feedback loops. And I think that they're fun. And I think across all those dimensions, meme coins are an extension of that trend. So meme coin trading, you can make money over short timeframes. Thats the short term feedback loop that you need.
01:00:52.750 - 01:02:06.958, Speaker B: It preserves the potential to make multiples on capital, and it increases like fun in the same way that gambling does. But like further, like reduces that mental friction of like, risk taking. So if you think of like, what a gambling app does, right, let's say draftkings, like, you can get a payoff within a game. So a two or three hour period, you can get a payoff within like, pitch to pitch on an MLB game. And you can have fun doing it instead of investing in traditional markets, you can bet on the game. Meme coins are the same, but except you're betting on the latest social thing to reduce risk taking, to throwing $100 on man and finance coin, rather than having to think about which team has the upper hand on another team, is like, to me, an extension of that trend and like, consumer retail risk taking. So I think that that's pretty underappreciated.
01:02:06.958 - 01:02:31.280, Speaker B: And like, is like, will meme coin activity dump like 80 90% in the next drawdown? Like, of course. But we can look from like cycle to cycle where meme coin activity on like a four year basis, on a crypto psycho basis, keeps extending, keeps improving, and I think that that's underappreciated by the market.
01:02:31.740 - 01:03:49.142, Speaker A: So one of the best stats I saw you post recently on this topic is Americans wagered 90 billion in 2022 at casinos, and gambling apps swifted 186 billion in volume since its first sex listing in January of this year, which seems to suggest that, as you said in the tweet, the market for meme coins is larger than what people give it credit for. My question with this, and I tend to agree with the analogy and with the framing here, but what I wonder is what will the form factor of this genre of app, whether it's attention, tokens, meme coins essentially betting on tokenized attention, whether it's, and it could be the meme of the day, it could be pop culture, it can be like politify you with, see, with these election coins. But the form factor is interesting because with sports, you have rules, you have refs, you have this larger industry that is hopefully ensuring there's no foul play happening. Games aren't fixed, there's knowledge of how the games work. So people in some ways think they can kind of beat the market. And oh, I know this guy is going to win this fight. I'm going to put some money on that because I watch his YouTube channel or something like that.
01:03:49.142 - 01:04:29.936, Speaker A: With meme coins, it's just such a, it's such a wild west right now. You're having these, this, this meta where people will like bought a token to be king of hill and pump fun and then just sell all the supply immediately. The hit rate for some of these has gone way down. The saturation has gone way up. How do we think we can maybe formalize this? Is that even possible, just given the permissionless nature of crypto and make it more, I guess, attainable for someone to get a quote unquote win versus. Let's use online sports betting as an example. I mean, these gambling apps are really good at.
01:04:29.936 - 01:04:49.680, Speaker A: They bring you in the door with incentives. Maybe they match a bet and most people have won at least one parlay or something, or maybe not a parlay, but one individual bethe. So you kind of have some momentum there for meme coins. I feel like these days, especially if you just go on Solana Subreddit, everybody's just losing all the time. It's a Bloodbath out there.
01:04:50.740 - 01:05:35.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know enough about the hit rates. It would be interesting to see a study on that. I'm sure that we will. But yeah, I don't know enough about the hit rates to say, look, if I knew the answer, like I probably build that thing because I do think that it's a big market. I do think that's a big market because it just minimize, it further minimizes that friction to retail risk taking and it makes it fun. But when I look out into the market, I do see think of where we've gone over the past, say six to eight months with this meme coin Craze. Where we started without Pumpfun.
01:05:35.914 - 01:06:25.386, Speaker B: Now we have pumpfun. Now we have Pumpfun plus social. In this Twitch streaming that they're doing now, unlonely is integrating meme coins into their live streams. Now Dex screener is kind of verticalizing with a launchpad as well as the trading UI. Youre seeing the market kind of like form into a few different shots on goal here. I know Raj from Solana tweeted that he would love to see a TikTok for meme coin trading and its kind of just serving you up or your cohort. What kind of memes would be relevant for you? I think that goes a long way in formalizing it, but I dont know if thats a like the like kind of the end state form factor.
01:06:25.386 - 01:06:53.480, Speaker B: There's going to be a lot of experimentation. There really is. There's going to be a lot of experimentation and I'm excited to see where it goes. Do I know where it's going to go? Look, I'll be watching pump fun and lonely's kind of like and unlonely's like kind of social streaming plus like Launchpad product. To see how that, to see how that takes off and kind of take it from there, I really can say.
01:06:54.460 - 01:07:20.440, Speaker C: I was listening to an interesting interview with Tarun Chitra and he was sort of flipping it around and saying maybe with meme coins in the future you'll be able to have this incentivized trending list, almost like how you have on Twitter the top ten trending topics. You can almost use meme coins in the future state to get this crowdsourced version of what actually is trending in the world at the moment, which I thought was an interesting take.
01:07:20.900 - 01:08:05.300, Speaker B: Yeah, you're kind of seeing that today too, right? With like, I think Dex Freener and Gecko terminal will have that, like, trending coins list. Unfortunately, from like a money making perspective. Like, it's probably late if it's there, but yeah, I don't know the hit rates and, you know, thinking about it, like, I don't think I'm that worried about the hit rates. I wrote a newsletter for blockworks kind of likening this to sports gambling. And like, 90% of the males in my network do sports gambling. None of them make money. The hit rate over a long enough timeframe is like, it's so, sorry, I guess that's not hit rate, but none of them make money and they lose quite a bit.
01:08:05.300 - 01:08:55.470, Speaker B: It's more like fun. There's a social aspect to it, right? So, like, the draft kings college football barstool sports paradigm is very much like the deck screener, crypto Twitter and crypto podcast paradigm where we, like taking these risks. We mostly lose. We talk shit to our friends about it, and then we like, listen to podcasts about meme coin trading and we talk about it on crypto Twitter. Like, it's kind of like the same thing. There's like this social market forming around these industries. Like, we're doing it right now, right? We're doing it right now.
01:08:55.470 - 01:09:16.329, Speaker B: So, yeah, there are a lot of parallels there. I'm excited to see where it's going. I'm really rooting for pumpfun. I think it's so cool that they've generated like 60 million in total revenue so far. Like, what a stat. I think they, and they had one day where they outpay, where they outpaced the daily revenue of Ethereum. Like, fantastic.
01:09:16.329 - 01:09:18.249, Speaker B: Absolutely fantastic.
01:09:19.149 - 01:09:51.258, Speaker A: Yeah. A lot of people would say are upset with the saturation they brought in, but I think what they've done is remarkable genre of applications. In some ways, I guess you can consider pumpfun, like the actual TikTok of meme coins. I mean, they kind of boiled it down to a really simple feed. Very, just constant, chaotic. And one's outranking the other on the homepage and trying to be king of the hill. Yeah, I think they're going to do really well.
01:09:51.258 - 01:10:22.132, Speaker A: I'm not super convinced. At least in the short term, one can compete directly with them. If one were to, it would look very different. Just like maybe the analogy is they're like MySpace and then Facebook came along, did a lot of things just completely differently that resonated with a larger audience. That's kind of what would need to happen for someone to actually compete with them. But I'm not super convinced it's going to happen anytime soon. And now the other funny thing is you're seeing social apps, like not plays or something like that.
01:10:22.132 - 01:10:31.994, Speaker A: It's a Gen Z social media app that's number one in the app store right now. That does look like MySpace. And so you had a complete kind of reversal of that trend back to where we started, uh, which is kind of funny to see.
01:10:32.162 - 01:10:37.070, Speaker B: Sal, are you seeing anything in, like, the tan ecosystem around meme coins?
01:10:37.810 - 01:11:12.070, Speaker A: Yeah, there's some stuff happening. The key challenge for me at least, is I can actually use the wallet, and it's kind of hard to even just get tan in the US, so I haven't been able to try as much, but there absolutely is stuff happening there. I think it's going to grow pretty rapidly, too. Again, I think it's going to start getting listed. Taunt is on more exchanges, it's going to be more easy to access, and I think eventually the wallet will be usable in more jurisdictions, so that'll definitely help. But Solana is still, I think, the king of memes for the time being.
01:11:12.810 - 01:12:09.710, Speaker C: I think one thing I like about pumpfun as well is it's almost a feeder app onto the wider general purpose defi applications on Solana. So as long as it gets over, I think it's 69k or something, market cap, it then moves over to radium, and then everyone can access it and buy it if they want. Whereas I think a lot of the other socialfi applications which are doing really, really well, but generally the tokens which you can buy, so friendtech being an example, the tokens which you can buy are within this walled garden. They're not open to the broader public. I just don't know if that friction is maybe holding them back and maybe the big socialfi applications of the future are going to be closer to pumpfun, where they are utilizing the broader infrastructure, which is already there, rather than forcing everyone into this ward garden. But wondering if you've got any thoughts on that or the broader social fire ecosystem.
01:12:10.770 - 01:13:02.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's really interesting. Speculation is very much crypto superpower financialization. But I think back to my own personal experience with Farcaster, where I liked it way like, I liked it so much more before the speculation came. I believe that their user numbers are still strong, but it's not obvious to me that it helped because there has been a reset in users. It would be. It would be great if we saw more applications allow varying degrees of speculation over time instead of just opening up the floodgates. Maybe allow a subset of creators or just across certain dimensions like selling nfts.
01:13:02.954 - 01:13:49.330, Speaker B: Or maybe the promotion would have to be approved in some way because it can get really scammy really quick. I'm really rooting for social fi. I think that Farcaster is a fantastic shot on goal. I think they've done mostly everything right so far, but the kind of like opening the floodgates to speculation within social fi, it's not clear to me that that's the right path. I think it needs to be more tamed and tailored and slowly allowed on these platforms over time, which goes against the ethos. Its a catch 22 right? Because then you have youre selling to crypto people. Inevitably those are your first customers and that might go against the ethos.
01:13:49.330 - 01:13:55.090, Speaker B: I think its really challenging, but im excited to see what Farcaster does next.
01:13:55.870 - 01:14:12.730, Speaker C: I often think how negative social media is and all the negative effects it has on young people. And then I think about whats it going to be like if theres just unbridled speculation put on top as well. It's a slightly terrifying thought and it's not really something that people give much air time to.
01:14:14.070 - 01:14:48.260, Speaker B: Yeah, speculation is super useful. Like Deepin, fantastic, like bootstrapping, something like bitcoin. Who would have thought that you can create a system like that? So solely based on game theory and speculation, injecting it into social applications is super tricky. Again, not exactly clear to me that it needs to be tamed, it needs to be tailored, it needs to be slowly allowed in these applications over time.
01:14:50.600 - 01:15:36.314, Speaker A: That's, again, not to make it full circle. That's why I like this strategy these apps on ton are doing, which is everybody wins. There's no way you can lose by just kind of farming a certain mechanic in a game. And then the speculation kind of just happens over time as you use the actual game, you get past the distribution mechanism and all right, yeah, now you want to level up your pet or whatever and kind of invest time and money into this thing in hopes of beating someone else. Then you just allow certain classes of users to do the more perhaps, I guess, dangerous behaviors. And this is kind of an artifact that was common in web two games mmos, right. Like only 1% of the players or so were set on doing PvP mechanics and kind of leveling up the characters.
01:15:36.314 - 01:15:49.670, Speaker A: A lot of them were just there for social reasons or just to explore. So I suspect we might see kind of similar user Personas play out with social when we start to embed speculative primitives inside the app itself.
01:15:52.270 - 01:16:03.530, Speaker C: I'm appreciate we're running out of time, but maybe a final quick question. But Ryan and Sal, sort of got a question for both of you, but do you have any advice for people that would like to become analysts within crypto?
01:16:05.750 - 01:16:37.680, Speaker A: Sal, nice. Yeah, I can kick it off here. Yeah. I mean, I've interviewed a lot of people when I was a researcher at Galaxy, and the number one thing that stands out like a sore thumb is intellectual curiosity. It doesn't really matter what it's what it's about, but if I can sense that you know more about something in crypto than you know anyone I've ever met, which is not that hard to do, by the way, because crypto is so big and no one has time to go into all these rabbit holes, that is the best way to start. Just follow your curiosity. It's very.
01:16:37.680 - 01:17:06.330, Speaker A: It's a lot easier to kind of get into this complex technical stuff and to find the most obscure projects and learn about them when you really care about it. Think from first principles. Don't just follow the trends. Don't try to be the thousandth guy to evaluate perp Dexs on Ethereum. Right. You're not going to stand out that way. But if you're the tan expert on click to earn, I guarantee you there's a hedge fund that will probably hire you tomorrow because they think they can make money there and no one else knows enough about them because they're kind of silly.
01:17:06.330 - 01:17:07.830, Speaker A: So that's kind of my advice.
01:17:09.060 - 01:17:28.212, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say just keep doing things. I totally agree with Sal, but, yeah, just keep doing things. Like, crypto is the easiest place to put yourself out there. Think about Tradfi. A quant guy doesn't want to tell you about his strategy. It's like his secret. Everyone wants to talk to you in crypto, so just keep doing things.
01:17:28.212 - 01:17:36.660, Speaker B: Just keep talking. Information like you generate information. That's feedback. Yeah, just. Just dive right in.
01:17:38.840 - 01:17:46.660, Speaker A: Amazing. Ryan, thank you so much for joining us. And let's revisit the whole conversation in six months or so, see who was right about what.
01:17:47.480 - 01:17:49.600, Speaker B: Totally. Let's do it again. Guys. Had a blast.
