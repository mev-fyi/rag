00:00:14.280 - 00:00:19.230, Speaker A: All right, so we are here in episode three of unlayered. How's it going, Dave? What's up? What's new?
00:00:19.342 - 00:00:23.406, Speaker B: All good, all bit ill this week. Caught the, caught the famous Covid.
00:00:23.510 - 00:00:25.734, Speaker A: Oh, no. Is it your first time with COVID.
00:00:25.814 - 00:00:33.776, Speaker B: No, it is the second time before. Yeah, it's the second time, but yeah, it's just when you've got, when you've got a kid, then suddenly it becomes.
00:00:33.800 - 00:00:36.752, Speaker C: All a lot worse because, yeah, you.
00:00:36.768 - 00:00:41.456, Speaker B: Can'T take them to nurseries, so suddenly you're ill looking after your child all day and trying to do a podcast as well.
00:00:41.480 - 00:00:42.520, Speaker A: But yeah, yeah.
00:00:42.632 - 00:00:50.312, Speaker B: As we know, this podcast, it waits for no man. So, you know, here I am. We did an interview last night, so getting through it. How are you doing, Sal?
00:00:50.408 - 00:01:58.850, Speaker A: I'm doing well. Super busy these weeks, but, you know, excited to kind of get into this episode and actually related to the topic today. So today is all about Saga and the phone, but just a bit of news in the Twitter sphere, we're hearing a ton of outrage about Ledger. So Ledger today announced a new feature where basically one can recover their seed phrase with a passport or other government issued id. And the outrage is that the way this works? From what I understand, and it's very surface level, but from what I understand, Ledger is sharding your key and sending it over the cloud to some secure security providers, I guess, that manage all those pieces of the key, then one could recover it by them combining that key through this new service they're offering that they're charging for. Pretty interesting news. I think a lot of the outrage just centers on this notion that people didn't, they didn't sign up for this necessarily, this new ability to just overnight over the air, do a firmware update.
00:01:58.850 - 00:02:15.354, Speaker A: And now their device can theoretically, like, communicate shards of their key over the Internet. A lot of people are upset. Ledger, I not sure, is handling this tremendously well on the comm side. What are your initial thoughts on this, David?
00:02:15.474 - 00:02:55.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, as you say, the story is still quite new. But to me, the only way we're going to get mass adoption is to have some sort of key recovery system in place. I don't believe that we can scale to billions of people if they have to write down their twelve or 24 seed words and never lose it. Otherwise you lose all your money. So there has to be some solutions put forward. So I'm all for sort of someone trying it, and it could be a reaction, as we've seen, for example, on Solana with, with royalty enforcement. Initially, people weren't really happy with it, and maybe it's a bit centralizing, but eventually that social layer, social consensus says, okay, fine, this is something we can accept.
00:02:55.750 - 00:03:06.422, Speaker B: So I'm all for them trying it, but perhaps the issue is that people haven't been asked necessarily and didn't necessarily sign up for this. What are your views?
00:03:06.598 - 00:03:38.082, Speaker A: Right, right. You know, there are a couple of interesting things with respect to ledger is that they have this history of one leaking. I think, you know, it leaked their entire database, basically, of email addresses and I think physical addresses too, of people who bought a ledger. Just terrible. Just probably the worst thing you could possibly leak is like the physical location of the device itself, theoretically. So kind of a checkered pass there. The other piece to this is that of the big hardware wallet providers.
00:03:38.082 - 00:04:16.286, Speaker A: Like Trezor is their biggest competitor. Trezor is built on open source software, but ledger is notoriously closed source. So it's like, that's like strike two, right? Like the leak was strike one. Just the fact overall, since their history, they've always been doing closed source approach to security. And maybe that's strike one technically, and then the leak is strike two and now this is like strike three. I think people feel betrayed that they didn't even know. Like perhaps a lot of people would have never bought a ledger had they known that theoretically one could connect it to this service and have their key sharded and communicated over the Internet.
00:04:16.286 - 00:04:58.068, Speaker A: I think that's where the outrage is. I don't know. I agree. Like, social recovery totally needs to be a thing. And that's what a lot of smart contract wallets are working on and building into their core feature set. Smart contract wallets like Argent and, and Zen Ledger and other providers too. I guess the question is, should it be the same manufacturer of this hardware device that's also doing this recovery mechanism or should we push that down the stack, so to speak, at maybe the software layer that connects to the wallet and handle recovery that way? It's unclear, but certainly this has gotten a lot of people riled up.
00:04:58.216 - 00:05:13.220, Speaker B: So my only query would be, you buy your ledger. Normally you set up your key on the ledger and ideally you should never connect it with any software. You should just use it, sort of transfer coins in and out. So my only question to that would.
00:05:13.252 - 00:05:15.692, Speaker C: Be, is it possible to do the.
00:05:15.708 - 00:05:21.636, Speaker B: Social recovery at the software level if you're trying to socially recover a hardware wallet?
00:05:21.780 - 00:06:00.360, Speaker A: The way I might think about this is maybe. So the comparison is you have all your money on a ledger and then you also enable this feature where you can socially recover it through this ledger service. When I say like doing it through software, I think some of these approaches involve maybe having an entire backup, maybe a social guardian is what they call it. I think so it's either a friend or it can be just a separate hardware wallet that is one of your guardians and you have like a two of three. And that can recover the seed phrase for the software wallet. I think that's one approach that works. There's truly a lot of ways to do this.
00:06:00.360 - 00:06:26.898, Speaker A: The outrage again is just this idea that we should just trust ledger to do all of these implementations correctly given their checkered history with leaking data and now introducing this new complexity to their software, this potential attack vector versus users deciding if they want to do that by choosing to use and onboard another software provider and then maybe using their hardware wallet as like a guardian or something like that.
00:06:26.986 - 00:06:42.786, Speaker B: It's interesting and almost it's a segue onto today's show because the other option for how this goes is that most people start using the secure enclave in their mobile phones and it acts as this. I know it's not as secure as.
00:06:42.810 - 00:06:44.306, Speaker C: A ledger or a Trezor, but obviously.
00:06:44.330 - 00:07:10.802, Speaker B: It'S infinitely more usable, more portable, and maybe that's what over 90% of people are going to end up using rather than a ledger. So just moving on to that subject. So Sal, I know you've used the saga which we're talking about today's show, just wondering what your, I think it was the developer version, but just wondering what your views were of it so far.
00:07:10.868 - 00:07:33.894, Speaker A: So yeah, I had the developer version, I still have it and just got the production version in the mail a couple days ago. So kind of play around with that. It's a pretty sweet Android phone. Just separately it's pretty, it feels pretty high end. So for comparison, I also use as my daily driver the iPhone 14 Pro Max. It's very big, heavy phone. And just looking at these two, they're almost the same size actually.
00:07:33.894 - 00:07:54.262, Speaker A: So this is literally almost the same exact size as like the gigantic pro Pro Max phone. It's a little bit narrower, a little bit shorter, but only just slightly. And it's about the same weight from what I can feel, pretty heavy in terms of functionality. I think there's limited Dapps available in the Dappstore today, but that's kind of what I'm most excited about.
00:07:54.358 - 00:08:35.338, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. And I think the biggest companies in the world, they do take risks and they have come out with products which people maybe didn't even realize they needed, or just something new. And so I really sort of appreciate the ambition of the Solana team by releasing this phone. I think yesterday there was a tweet going around which mirrored a lot of your comments about it's good, but there were some issues, and this tweet was getting a lot of traffic. And basically, in the comment section, it was just piled in with sort of eTh fans just hating on it and saying, oh, it's a scam. I don't know. To me, there's an element of the crypto space.
00:08:35.338 - 00:09:12.524, Speaker B: I think it started out very bright eyed and optimistic and everyone pulling together against the dark forces of the banks and inflation and things like that. And now it feels extremely, extremely tribal and something which would be a net positive for the whole crypto space. If a crypto phone or crypto software or hardware can sort of reach a wider market, that has to be good for crypto has to be good. And yet it receives a huge amount of hate and distrust from large segments of the crypto community.
00:09:13.144 - 00:10:05.394, Speaker A: Yeah, it just feels like anytime any ecosystem announces something, it's zero sum in the sense that maybe people are hitting on saga, releasing a phone, or maybe they're celebrating Solana going down, and it goes the other way, too. When ETH had its issue, I don't even know what to call it. I mean, no one wants to admit it was an outage. It was just something that happened that wasn't ideal last week when it was kind of unusable for those two days, and then people in Solana were celebrating that, which is kind of the wrong mindset, too, I think, because crypto is still really small. You know, rising tide lifts all boats kind of thing. The phone helps Ethereum, to the extent that software is built using the Solana mobile stack and the wallet adapter, which, again, we get into during this interview. So, I don't know, it just seems silly to just root for it to fail.
00:10:05.974 - 00:10:45.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agreed. I think if we can send any message out, I know that we are a podcast which is focusing on non EVM chains, but I do truly believe that everyone in the crypto community has said so small that everyone does sort of need to pull together and support other victories, because I always come back to this, that I think it's less than 10 million people have ever interacted with a smart contract on chain, and that's 10 million people out of 8 billion. So, you know, we're not even at the starting line. I think it's way too early and way too short sighted for communities to hate on each other. So, yeah, hopefully that can be a message to kick off this podcast.
00:10:46.144 - 00:11:37.080, Speaker A: We're not at the starting line, and the way to get from that 10 million to 8 billion is 1000% going to be through a mobile phone. There is absolutely zero doubt about that whatsoever. Just look at the metrics on mobile adoption versus desktop adoption. Globally, the idea of owning a laptop computer is very much not a thing in almost every country except for, like, first world countries and wealthy countries. So we clearly are skating towards this world where the future of crypto is going to be on mobile for sure. The only question is, how do we get there? Apple is dragging their feet on allowing crypto to leverage its secure enclave and allowing crypto applications to avoid this 30% tax in the app store. Yes, a lot of mobile is on an Android phone.
00:11:37.080 - 00:12:19.198, Speaker A: Most of the world uses Android. Two thirds of the world is on Android, not iOS. A lot of things are lining up for potential tailwinds here, but again, it'll come down to execution and adding value to a lot of people's lives. So today's interview is with Steven Laver. Steven is currently the lead software engineer for mobile on the saga team at Solana Labs, and he previously had stints at Apple, Google, Fitbit and Qualcomm. So obviously a very impressive engineering pedigree. And throughout this discussion, we just try to learn about the vision for Saga, what the process was to make this fun a reality, and what the advantages are of this phone compared to what's available on the market.
00:12:19.198 - 00:12:41.182, Speaker A: So a super cool discussion and learned a ton about potentially what the future of crypto mobile experiences will be. All right, so we have Steven from Solana, who leads saga efforts at Solana. Stephen, thank you for joining us today.
00:12:41.278 - 00:12:45.174, Speaker D: I'm excited to be here, happy to talk about SMS and Saga with your audience.
00:12:45.334 - 00:13:01.380, Speaker A: Likewise, likewise. So I want to just come right off the bat, why is saga not a marketing gimmick? Like, why is it something more that we should care about? What is so you unique about Saga compared to past efforts at bringing crypto to mobile?
00:13:01.492 - 00:13:33.184, Speaker D: So let me start off with just the fact that crypto is eventually going to be a first class citizen on mobile platforms. Our phones have won everywhere else. I don't know about you, but I don't decide to use the Internet and sit down on my desktop. For the most part. I say I want to do something, whether that be social, whether that be news, stocks, anything. I pull up my phone, pretty much the only place in my life where I don't do that naturally yet is with web3 and crypto. But that's changing.
00:13:33.184 - 00:13:52.890, Speaker D: And honestly, that's why we're building saga is a home, a place that we control, that we can make the best decisions possible to make. Not just using web3 and crypto possible, but make it enjoyable and convenient to use on mobile. And having our own platform that we control top to bottom, that's how we think we can make that happen.
00:13:53.032 - 00:14:16.230, Speaker A: Right, but let me actually drill in because I'm curious, how did you guys come to the decision to do the phone? So I totally get your point about we do everything on mobile these days. Mobile is the main medium through which people use the Internet, like you said earlier. But why Solana specifically to do the phone? Kind of interesting that the protocol developer is also taking this mobile strategy.
00:14:16.342 - 00:14:55.224, Speaker D: So the phone is ultimately just a platform here to deliver web3 and crypto. Just like you have all the web apps, the browser on your desktop is a platform to deliver it. The phone is that same platform. And so it's less about while building a product is important, it's more about building out the technologies and building out the platform so that it can happen. Personally, I come from a long background of building mobile, so I want to see web3 and I want to see crypto succeed on mobile devices. And there's things that we could only do if we came out with our own phone. The Solana Dapp store is a great example of that.
00:14:55.224 - 00:15:31.174, Speaker D: Even though you can side load applications on most every Android phone, the reality is that users, for the most part, use the application stores that ship on their devices, primarily the Google Play Store. The policies in the Google Play Store, while doing a great job of bringing general content to mobile users, has some policies in place that make it difficult or impossible to bring those the web3 business models to mobile devices. And so having our own phone means we can have technologies like the Solana Dapp store that are in the box and ready to use for customers.
00:15:31.294 - 00:16:13.662, Speaker A: Okay, so you brought up some awesome points and facets about building mobile applications. You brought side loading other things. Maybe it'll be helpful for our listeners to kind of set the groundwork. First, how did we get to this point where it's impossible to use crypto applications on something like an iPhone, and it's very hard to have full functionality in the app store, maybe even commentary. And just this general trend we're seeing, at least on the app store side, where Apple takes that 30% tax and there's this lawsuit with Epic Games, maybe it would be helpful from your perspective. How did we get here? Why is it so hard to use crypto on current mobile phones today? And why is saga the solution in.
00:16:13.678 - 00:17:00.818, Speaker D: Terms of using crypto on mobile devices today? Primarily in both ecosystem, whether it be the Apple ecosystem or Google's Android ecosystem, really, both of those companies are acting to a certain extent as a gatekeeper. They're deciding the terms by which applications can be delivered to customers. And the terms, really the business models that those applications within their application stores need to live by. There's a few big ones in there that impact web3. One of the big ones is, like you mentioned, the revenue share aspect right away. If you sell a digital good through the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, you are required to use their payment systems. You are required to pay a percentage of the sale price of that digital good.
00:17:00.818 - 00:17:53.224, Speaker D: Back to the, the platform owner, Google or Apple in this case. And given that users or the applications, the assets that are being sold are owned by the users, it's not like Magic Eden, for example, is selling an NFT to users. They're facilitating the sale of nfts. And so they don't actually own the good. They're not in a position to pay a 30% tax on behalf of their users, for example. And so really, that's the motivation for the Solana Dapp store, is a set of an application store with policies that support all the things we want to do in the web3 ecosystem, supporting the sales of nfTs, supporting DeFi, supporting alternate payment systems. We want applications that we distribute through the Solana Dapp store to have their own financial relationships with their customers without Solana mobile getting involved.
00:17:53.964 - 00:18:29.564, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting what you just said, and I'd just like to double click on it. But I mean, prior to blockchain, obviously you couldn't really own digital assets. And so this was never really an issue. You had gaming companies who just create digital assets out of thin air, effectively sell them to their users. And then it doesn't seem so crazy that Apple and Google charge this sort of 20 30% fee for distribution effectively. But it's almost like we've entered this new paradigm where there is ownership of these digital assets. The companies which are selling them or acting as the intermediary didn't issue them themselves for nothing.
00:18:29.564 - 00:18:41.816, Speaker C: And so, yeah, it's almost like we need to enforce a rule change in their policies. So it seems to me that that's the direction that you guys are going in trying to enforce that sort of change that's required.
00:18:41.960 - 00:19:37.164, Speaker A: It seems to me like there is this weird kind of market dynamic where the gatekeepers, so you say, like the app store developers, Google and Apple, this monopolistic or duopolistic control over the market. But it does kind of remind me of back in the day when the iPod touch first came out, iPhone came out. There were other third party app stores that were somewhat available to users who jailbroke their phones. While it was interesting and you could theoretically download any application as an end user, it also brought a lot of risk where a lot of hacks were exposed through jailbroken phones. And in some ways it seems like kind of analogous to that move away from Limewire for pirated music. Some consumers started kind of appreciating the curation that the app store did for Apple phones and to an extent that the play store did. Do you have any kind of initial reaction to that? Like as how does that dovetail with the vision for Saga?
00:19:37.284 - 00:20:07.022, Speaker D: It's actually sort of. It's a difficult position or a difficult road we've had to navigate here. We work in the web3 ecosystem, which is very open. People have an expectation of decentralization here. But at the same time, this is an application store that can deliver assets to a user's phone. And your phone is a very personal thing. It has a lot of data about you and it has a lot of capabilities that you wouldn't necessarily want to open up to anything and everything completely unfiltered on the web.
00:20:07.022 - 00:20:43.780, Speaker D: And so our salon adapt store, this is a store of decentralized applications. The publishing that happens here is all on chain. Anyone can go and publish an application using the publishing metadata format that we've described. But we are curating the catalog, we are reviewing submissions. Anyone is free to submit an application to us. We have a set of policies that we publish on GitHub that describes the exact criteria under which we will review submissions to our application store. But we are still taking an active hand in the curation of this catalog over time.
00:20:43.780 - 00:21:10.320, Speaker D: We do want to involve the community more and more in some of these decisions, but we take the trust and safety of our users very seriously. And so because of that, we do review every submission to the catalog, and we review it against our policies and to make sure that it is not doing anything deceptive, is not trying to steal users funds, where we want to make sure that the content in the store represents the best of web3 to the best of our abilities.
00:21:10.512 - 00:21:25.128, Speaker A: So there is curation on the Solana side for the Solana Dapp store. But does it also mean, like, other Dapp stores could kind of exist too, in parallel, where maybe there's fewer boundaries for developers?
00:21:25.256 - 00:22:03.434, Speaker D: Yep, I'm glad you brought that up. And that's, it's a difficult distinction to convey, but it's something that we really made sure when we were designing our the Solana Dapp store, the on chain publishing, that data is open. It's owned by the person who publishes the application. It's represented as nfts, and that is on chain. They could take that same data and they could submit it to any other application store that they wanted. You know, fundamentally, all the metadata, all the screenshots, all the icons, everything is in a open format that any application store could choose to consume. That part of our publishing is completely unopinionated.
00:22:03.434 - 00:22:43.560, Speaker D: Where the opinion comes in is in the curation of our catalog. And so we have obviously, the user experiences the Dappstore through an application that runs on saga. And so when you launch that application, you're viewing the catalog as we've created it by curating, reviewing, making sure that we're enforcing applications respect, user trust and safety. But it's still an Android device. You can side load anything you want on it. Someone else could create an alternate app store that consumes the same source data, these applications on chain, and they could publish that and allow users to download applications, and they could have their own opinion on what a catalog should look.
00:22:43.592 - 00:22:50.932, Speaker A: Like for the listeners, rather. Can you define what you mean by side loading and what the difference between that and like, a regular application would be on your phone?
00:22:51.048 - 00:23:25.554, Speaker D: So Android phones will let you install applications from sources other than the stores that ship on the phone. So Google Play store ships. On the majority of Android devices on Saga, we ship, in addition to Google Play, we ship the salon adapt store. You can launch those and just install applications. And that's how most users do get the applications for their phone. But you can also distribute packages on the Internet. You can hook it up through USB to your phone, you can download a file, and you can actually install that application that comes from some other source other than those application stores.
00:23:25.554 - 00:23:44.602, Speaker D: So users have always been free to do this on the majority of Android devices, and we've taken none of that away from users with Saga. So we have an opinion. We think that our Solana Dapp store is a great home for web3, but if anyone wants to use a different source, the phone is open and perfectly capable of doing that as well.
00:23:44.738 - 00:24:00.866, Speaker C: Are these effectively executable x nfts such as we're hearing from the backpack team. Is it the same idea? Whether it's an NFT, but it's actually an executable one? It's effectively a tokenized link to an application. Is that roughly how it works?
00:24:00.970 - 00:24:39.256, Speaker D: So in this case, we're using the on chain metadata to describe a traditional Android application. So the applications that are distributed in the Solana Dapp store at the moment are just, they're called apks on Android application packages. Those are built with traditional Android development tools. They're packaged up, they're signed by the developer, and then they're hosted on chain. An NFT describes where the application store can go and find the APK, how it can download it, and describes all the other details about it. But it still is just a standard Android application. I'm excited about Xnfts.
00:24:39.256 - 00:24:58.236, Speaker D: It's certainly an area we're going to be looking at combining into the Dappstore in the future. But right now the contents of the Dappstore are very traditional Android applications. It's this interesting bridge between everything that mobile does great and the web3 world brought together through a traditional Android application package.
00:24:58.380 - 00:25:11.352, Speaker C: Would you suggest then that these traditional Android applications will be more familiar to traditional web two users, for example, whereas maybe X NFTs would be a lighter application. Is that a fair problem?
00:25:11.548 - 00:26:11.008, Speaker D: Yep, I think that's a pretty good assessment. You know, we look at what our phones can do around the array of sensors, the super rich input mechanisms, the constant connectivity. To take advantage of all of those capabilities, you have to build a native application for the devices you think of using, for example, a web application through, say, mobile chrome on your phone, it works pretty well. But when you compare that to the experience of using, say, an application like Instagram for example, night and day difference in terms of the amount of interactivity, the quality of that experience, the smoothness, the ability to animate and to just be a very immersive experience. And that is the main reason that we are, you know, we built this Dapp store is we want to deliver that quality of experience to web3 on mobile devices. And right now the best channel for that is native applications. The web platform and XnFts are constantly developing.
00:26:11.008 - 00:26:39.624, Speaker D: We want to land those great experiences on this device as well. I view this as a whole spectrum, all the way from very rich native applications on one end through xnfts and then up through web dapps on the other end. A user on mobile should be able to experience all of these on their device, not just the historic case, which was web dapps kind of delivered either through in app browsers or mobile chrome with varying qualities of experience.
00:26:40.244 - 00:27:10.966, Speaker C: You mentioned how traditional applications use things like the camera, and obviously other applications use things like the GPS for Uber and Tinder and things like that. I mean, have you seen any applications which are trying to use these additional tools to augment web? Three applications? I feel like probably gaming would be an obvious one, but it seems a super interesting design space that's suddenly been opened up. So just wondering if you've seen any interesting potential applications.
00:27:11.150 - 00:27:49.960, Speaker D: Well, I'll admit I'm not neutral here. We have produced one of our own first party applications that we distribute through the Dappstore called Minty Fresh. And this actually came about. We were just as a team, just chatting, and someone on my team said, why can't we just mint an NFT from the camera in like 10 seconds? Why does minting have to be this big endeavor? Why can't I just snap a selfie with friends and have it on chain moments later? And so we actually said, that's actually a great use case. And so the team sat down. We kind of planned it out. We said at the time there was a hackathon going on.
00:27:49.960 - 00:28:12.354, Speaker D: We didn't submit it for the hackathon, but we wanted to be, we wanted to jump in and capture some of that community energy. And so we said, let's just go ahead and build this. Let's spend a week and see what happens. And that was the genesis of minty fresh. So I don't know if you've had a chance to try out minty fresh, but you basically just snap a photo, tap a few buttons, mints right to your wallet just like any other NFT.
00:28:12.774 - 00:28:41.344, Speaker A: That's super cool. I mean, I'm already thinking of like fun ideas that users can do with kind of user generated content. Like, even, for instance, take a legacy app like Snapchat and people make all kinds of filters for like their locations or their colleges. Getting some sort of attribution back if it was an NFT instead of just like a static image would be super cool. I know it's not the same use case, but that's just immediately where my mind jumped to when you said snapping a picture and making NFT in 10 seconds with the camera.
00:28:41.684 - 00:28:49.720, Speaker C: And I feel like photography nfts hasn't really taken off yet, so it could be exactly something to sort of kick start that area of nfts.
00:28:49.912 - 00:29:41.284, Speaker D: The concept of a ten second experience, that's one of the things that actually excites me most about bringing web3 to mobile is traditionally you sit down, you want to interact with your defi, interact with your NFTs. Whatever you want to do involved unpacking your laptop, setting up, getting connected, hooking up your wallet. That was a substantial investment of time. And so experiences tended to be sort of this complete end to end journey that would take minutes or even tens of minutes to run through on your desktop. I'm excited for what mobile does best, those little tiny bite sized interactions. And I go back to some use cases, like when an NFT mint is happening, why doesn't your phone just tell you, notify you a few tens of seconds before the mint, you just tap, yep, I wanna participate on the phone. And then it pops into the experience a few seconds beforehand.
00:29:41.284 - 00:30:25.020, Speaker D: You see whether or not you're successful, and then you go back to what you, what you were doing or when DeFi, when the market moves, you should, it should tell you when it's time to pay attention, when you need to make a decision. Social gaming, all these other use cases that work best on or that are great on phones are great because the phone tells you when it's time to interact and the phone allows you to be, since you're connected anywhere, it allows you to participate in these like tiny bite sized chunks. And I think that is, those are the experiences I'm most excited to see built because those are the experiences you can only deliver for web3 and for crypto using a mobile device, it's something that just is so different, but it's how users expect to use their mobile phones.
00:30:25.212 - 00:31:01.520, Speaker A: Totally, totally. I think another underrated part of that is you're kind of accessing a different demographic when you go mobile native. And what I mean by that is when I was trying to get parents and stuff to use crypto dapps in the past, a lot of them are optimized to run on MacBook Pros, running Chrome. And as soon as you introduce a Windows, there's some weird edge case for the extension wouldn't work or the wallet wouldn't work. But if you're using Android especially, which is popular all across the world except for America, basically across every age demographic, it seems like you can unify that user experience a bit, have kind of those magical moments you're alluding to.
00:31:01.672 - 00:31:32.204, Speaker D: And I think you hit on the on exactly the phrase there user experience, right. That is something that, you know, it's not that it doesn't exist for web3, but to go to a mass market to hit a billion users. There's something like ten times more mobile phones in the world than there are laptops. And so a solid user experience available on the device that everyone carries on the only computer that much of the world has in their possession. That's the way that we get to a billion users on crypto.
00:31:32.364 - 00:32:11.794, Speaker A: So that's actually the perfect segue. Kind of changing gears here. I want to talk a bit about the go to market strategy, but specifically, let's first start with how the saga release kind of happened this past April. I think a lot of people in the Solana community were kind of surprised that it happened so suddenly. I was expecting it to happen more in the summer, I guess, like the official release of the phone. Can you talk a bit about what that release was like? I think another thing I just hear from people in the ethereum side is that as soon as they look at the back of the phone and see the word Solana, they just distrust it for some reason. Can you comment a bit about the initial release?
00:32:12.094 - 00:32:55.996, Speaker D: Sure. One thing I will say is it only felt sudden to everyone who wasn't in the trenches on this. We announced it in June of 2022, and there was a lot of, a lot of effort, a lot of nights, a lot of weekends poured into producing this device. So I'm glad to see how well it's been received. So many of us have been pouring hearts and souls into making this device awesome, and it's always a little trepidatious to release something like this to the world. We did have the advantage of. We released dev kits for the phone early, and so we were able to both seed this out to a set of developers for them to start building on it, but also get a little bit of early feedback about the device.
00:32:55.996 - 00:33:37.864, Speaker D: And we were able to accommodate and integrate some of that feedback into the device that we started shipping a few weeks ago in April. So as far as the launch, it was exciting. We got to get back up on stage and tell the world that, yes, we said we were going to do this and we did it. A premium Android device. I'm not sure if you've had a chance to hold one in your hand yet, but it really does feel to me like the best Android devout device out there. It's got great industrial design, it's super fast, huge display, twelve gigs ram, 512 gigs flash, top of the line Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. This is a phone.
00:33:37.864 - 00:34:21.225, Speaker D: It's not just a crypto phone. It's not something I carry just for web3 and crypto. This is the phone that I carry as my only phone, and it does have that little Solana S on the back, which I was super pumped when I first saw the. Got the first sample in my hand and saw how the etching was going to look. I do understand how to certain parts of the broader community that the name Solana might raise some questions. But ultimately, Solana is the best chain to land this on in terms of the speed, in terms of the number of builders on this network, in terms of the super low fees, like all the things you want to do through those little bite size interactions are made better by Solana.
00:34:21.289 - 00:34:21.933, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:22.473 - 00:34:50.945, Speaker D: The initial launch of the phone does primarily support Solana, but it's an open phone. If an Ethereum app, for example, wanted to submit to our Dapp store, I would say, come on in, we're here, we're open. We want to be a home for web3, and we are progressively going to add support for additional chains, additional capabilities to this device. But to a certain extent, I'm a Solana Maxi, I want to see Solana succeed. I think Solana is the right chain for mobile, and so that's where we've put most of our investments so far.
00:34:51.129 - 00:35:16.080, Speaker A: Absolutely. Can you actually elaborate a bit on that point about compatibility with other chains? So I think there's a lot of talk about, theoretically, one could see an Ethereum wallet adapter work with the phone at the hardware level. But is anyone working on this, or why wasn't maybe this capable at launch to maybe galvanize that side of crypto? Can you speak a bit more on that, like how you see that playing out?
00:35:16.232 - 00:35:58.218, Speaker D: Sure. So I think I need to talk a little bit about the seed vault to tell this story. Seed vault is our technology that we've integrated deeply into this phone for secure custody of private keys and seeds. And so when you first set up this phone, you'll go through the device setup, and there'll be a set of screens that you'll follow to create a new seed phrase or import a seed phrase into this phone. Seed vault is actually not solely a part of Android. It's integrated into the system below the layer of Android. It primarily runs in an environment called the Qualcomm Secure Execution environment, which is a trusted execution environment, taking advantage of the secure hardware found in modern mobile phones.
00:35:58.218 - 00:36:39.850, Speaker D: So it uses a secure element to help with encrypting all your secrets when they're at rest. It uses a secure operating mode of the processor for processing your keys and signing transactions. And then it also has a secure UI, so it actually takes over the display, and it takes over the touch input from Android when you are entering your passcode or when you're typing in a seed phrase, so that Android itself never gets to see what those secrets are helping to keep all of your, you know, the custody of your keys even away from the operating system itself, taking advantage of all that secure hardware available in phones. This has to be integrated into the phone by the phone manufacturer.
00:36:39.962 - 00:37:02.950, Speaker A: So actually, I want to make a quick analogy here, just in case people are less familiar with, like your specific implementation or Solana's implementation of the secure element is a decent analogy here, like how. How iPhones handle face Id or touch Id when they use Apple pay. Are those credentials also stored locally at the hardware level and segregated from being accessible by applications?
00:37:03.062 - 00:37:56.356, Speaker D: Yep. So Apple uses what they call their secure enclave, which is based on many similar technologies, but baked in at the hardware level. Secure elements are found in most modern Android flagship devices, and Android does have key store technologies that do take advantage of that secure element to hold secrets away from the OS. What we've built here isn't like any kind of brand new hardware innovation, but we've taken advantage of all the great security hardware that already exists and made it application specific, brought in all the things that are needed to use that for blockchain, to use that for web3 key generation, transaction, signing encryption of all your secrets, trusted UI, all of these things integrated together specifically and only for signing web3 transactions, like a.
00:37:56.380 - 00:38:10.724, Speaker A: Ledger, for instance, does this in a segregated hardware device. Are you saying it operates similarly to that in that the key generation, signing and storage of the keys are happening at this separate place at the hardware level?
00:38:10.844 - 00:38:11.414, Speaker D: Yep.
00:38:11.524 - 00:38:16.374, Speaker A: You do the signature and then the application can just see that the signature was approved.
00:38:16.794 - 00:39:01.954, Speaker D: Exactly. This is very analogous to a ledger. I do want to call out one thing here, which is ledger is an amazing hardware product. It's super secure, built from the ground up just for crypto. What we've built here is we've taken all the security hardware available in mobile phones, but this is still a fundamentally different device than a ledger because this is, this does connect to the Internet. This is not a cold storage wallet that's completely air gapped from the Internet, but there's a huge gulf between the security of a ledger device at one end and software custody of keys in, say, an Android application acting as a wallet on the other end. We think that we've been able to get most of the way across that security spectrum.
00:39:01.954 - 00:39:30.034, Speaker D: We can take advantage of all of the secure element, all of the secure processing capabilities, but we can also, without having to sacrifice the user experience, you still have a full touch input, you still have a full display. You don't have to connect any external devices. So we think we can get almost all the way there in terms of up to the great security that a hardware wallet, like a ledger provides, while not having to sacrifice the user experience along the way.
00:39:35.874 - 00:40:03.128, Speaker A: For the end user. Maybe this person stores a lot of their crypto in a cold wallet, like a ledger or trezor. In terms of the user experience, should people be storing a lot of their funds on? Theoretically, if this phone was working perfectly, like on the phone itself, because it's in the secure enclave, or is this now kind of like a middle layer between a hot wallet on a chrome extension like metamask and a cold wallet? Like, how should they think about this in this suite of types of wallets out there?
00:40:03.266 - 00:40:58.558, Speaker D: So every user does have their own level of security and trust. What I'll say there is that since this is connected to the Internet, this isn't a true cold storage wallet. And so users who want to store millions of dollars of funds, for example, I would personally still recommend to them that they use a dedicated hardware device that they may not carry with them every day, and that certainly isn't connected to the Internet. But at the same time, anywhere where you would normally use a hot wallet, this would be a great thing to swap in. And this, in this case, being seed vault on Saga, and you immediately get substantially more security. You get to take advantage of all the harder cap, all this hardware security capabilities of the phone. For me, I would feel comfortable carrying far more assets in the seed vault on my saga than I would in a software only hot wallet.
00:40:58.558 - 00:41:23.154, Speaker D: I would still have a ledger or some other similar device on the side that I would use for long term cold storage of my assets. I want to support responsible custody practices of assets, but we did build this with high security in mind. The implementation has been audited, and it's been designed from the ground up to be a secure place to store your assets.
00:41:23.534 - 00:42:17.284, Speaker C: It's really interesting, because currently, the wallets that you get on mobile phones, as you say, the keys are stored at the software level, and now suddenly it's going to be at the hardware level in the phone, assuming that this future unravels as we expect it to. So I'm just sort of wondering what that future landscape will look like for wallets. Because if you've got your phantom and it's on your saga, really. You're the ones. Or the saga is the thing holding that private key, and suddenly the wallet over the top is just a sort of UI interface, really, and security suddenly isn't the important part of a wallet. So that's my first sort of realization. And then the other point is, would saga itself start to generate its own wallet? A built in wallet, for example, that you could just set up and then suddenly enter the wallet game, if you like.
00:42:17.634 - 00:43:04.562, Speaker D: So what you said, the first part there about this separation between the custody of the keys and then the services a user expects that their wallet software to provide. I think I had the same journey that many other software developers do into blockchain, which is you start and you say, hey, cool, there's all these private keys, there's all these algorithms that you use to derive them. That must be where all the cool things are happening. As I've gone down this journey of building saga and working with partners, including wallets, I've come to realize that wallets are an enabling layer that allow the interesting things to happen. But the custody of keys is very important. It's very necessary. It's also not interesting at all.
00:43:04.562 - 00:43:59.268, Speaker D: The interesting things are all about what you can do with your keys. And so, honestly, with C Vault, we took the boring part of the wallet and brought it into the system layer. We took the cryptography and the math, moved that into the secure layer of the system, supported by the secure element and the secure processing environment. But all the things that a wallet application does on top of that, the services it offers around visualizing your assets, understanding the movement of those assets, interfacing between dapps that want to use your funds, and the user's introspection and understanding of what those transactions are going to do. Those are all value add services that a wallet application still provides. That isn't something we brought into the system layer with seed vault. The second part of your question there was about a wallet application.
00:43:59.268 - 00:44:49.708, Speaker D: There's still so much that traditional wallet applications bring in conjunction with seed vault, and it's an area that moves quickly that there's still innovation happening, and there's still this room for new entrants, new innovation, new ideas, new user interfaces, new methods of connecting Dapps to wallets. And that is where I think we have partners like Phantom and Soulflare, ultimate wallet. All of these partners who have produced wallet apps that make use of seed vault and make use of mobile wallet adapter, one of our other SMS technologies, they do all kinds of great innovation. There and ultimately, I'm glad to have them on the platform because they're doing the interesting hard parts of being a wallet. The seed vault is intricate, but like I said before, it's intricate, but at the same time, it's kind of boring. And that's a good thing.
00:44:49.876 - 00:45:00.674, Speaker C: You just mentioned the wallet adapter, and I think that's the third prong, if you like, after the Dapp store and the, and the key vault. So could you just tell us a bit more about that, please?
00:45:00.834 - 00:45:52.624, Speaker D: Sure. So the best way to describe this would be an analogy to how people experience their dapps on the web. You visit any web Dapp, and there's this connect wallet button in the corner. You tap it and then Phantom comes up or soulflare comes up. Whatever the wallet the user chooses to use, there's a protocol there called Wallet adapter that is being used on desktop when it's running in a web environment. We built mobile wallet adapter as the analog for that, but on mobile devices, and so takes advantage of mobile technologies instead. There's still a protocol backing it, but we use on Android, we use intents, we use content providers, we use websockets to connect the two parties involved in doing anything interesting with crypto, which is signing messages, signing transactions, enumerating accounts, etcetera.
00:45:52.624 - 00:46:37.264, Speaker D: So mobile wallet adapter is both incredibly interesting to me because I worked on it. It's a fun protocol. It does a lot of the blocking and tackling of connecting dapps to wallets, but it's also something that a user should never really see. All they want to do is they want to be able to click some kind of connect button or have their dapps start communicating with their wallet. And that's what mobile wallet adapter is. It's that behind the scenes technology connecting dapps to wallets specifically designed for mobile devices, whether that be native applications running on those mobile devices, or whether that be traditional web dapps that connect over that. You would launch in Chrome on your mobile device and would connect with websockets to your wallet.
00:46:37.724 - 00:47:17.404, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. So if I understand it correctly, you're trying to reduce the friction. If you like, if you're on an application, even if it's on the browser in your phone, and then you want to connect it to your wallet, it will just reduce that friction and automatically know what it needs to connect to. Because just one follow up on that, I feel like recently on Phantom and maybe like Coinbase wallet, I'm not sure on the ETH side, but I feel like sometimes I do click on websites via the browser, connect wallet, and now it does seem to be able to automatically bring me to my phantom wallet, for example. So I don't know if they have implemented something similar or if you know anything about that.
00:47:17.524 - 00:47:54.162, Speaker D: So mobile wallet adapter is an open specification. There's a few wallets in Solana that have implemented it already. There are some other technologies in Solana that do something similar. For example, Phantom has their deep links which do something broadly similar, connecting adapt to a wallet. The difference with mobile wallet adapter is we designed it to be wallet agnostic. Any wallet can participate in this ecosystem, and it's built on top of standard mobile technologies. So that if you have two wallets installed, for example, and you want, you use a web Dap, use a native Dapp.
00:47:54.162 - 00:48:26.464, Speaker D: Whichever one, when you click that connect button, you should see that pop up that is very familiar to Android users. Pop up from the bottom of the screen saying basically, hey, you have two different wallets. Which one would you like to use for this? Right? You can choose which of the wallets. Maybe you have them segregated for, you know, custody purposes. Maybe your, you know, one wallet is used for your burner wallet and the other one you use for, you know, more long term custody. Maybe you just like to try out different user experiences of the wallets. Maybe one does something better than the other.
00:48:26.464 - 00:49:07.076, Speaker D: So mobile wallet adapter kind of makes that agnostic. No longer does every DAP have to code for every different wallet on the platform. So we've rolled that out, not just for saga, that's available today for every Android device. Any wallet that wants to can publish the interfaces, and then any Dapp can query those interfaces and consume it on a mobile device. So as far as the Solana ecosystem goes, we're starting to see more and more dapps and more and more wallets. Pick this up. And in fact, there's a lot of dapps out there that support it and may not even know they support it because we did roll it into the traditional web based wallet adapter.
00:49:07.076 - 00:49:46.906, Speaker D: So any dapp that uses wallet adapter can just rebuild, pick up the latest version, and magically they'll be able to connect on a mobile device. Assuming their web Dapp is friendly with mobile Chrome, they'll be able to connect to your native wallet and never even know they're talking to a different kind of wallet on your phone. So, similarly to seed vault, we built that Solana first, but it's an open protocol, and there's all the hooks and all the places that you would need to add in additional features and additional like chain identifiers, for example, to bring this technology multi chain. And so it's open. And I would love to see this spread beyond Solana as well.
00:49:47.050 - 00:49:51.854, Speaker A: So, Steven, tell us about, for potential buyers of the phone, what can they expect?
00:49:52.154 - 00:50:40.868, Speaker D: So one thing we're excited about with Saga is we really wanted this to be a phone that lived up to a lot of the expectations of people in this ecosystem. And people in web3 are used to their phone or their earning value or accruing value by participating. And so with Saga, we've launched the welcome pack. So when you first set up your saga device, you'll enter the Dapp store and you'll be prompted to mint a saga Genesis token. This is our way of rewarding and giving back to the early adopters of this device. And so for anyone who mints this saga Genesis token, we immediately airdrop them a small amount of soul to make sure they've got a little bit in their wallets to facilitate making transactions. We give you 20 USDC to get started.
00:50:40.868 - 00:51:19.346, Speaker D: But then there's also partners that we're working with. For example, Magic Eden. There's a reward box for users of saga who you launch magic Eden. They'll automatically put a reward box into your magic Eden account. We've also, we're doing an exclusive Kanosaurs mint, so two new Kleinosaur species that are exclusively for purchasers of saga. And we'll be doing several mint events over the coming weeks and months to reward users for having this vision and coming along with us on the journey of Saga. So we've got other partners as well.
00:51:19.346 - 00:51:34.018, Speaker D: If you launch the Dapp store, go through that welcome pack experience, and you'll see a selection of offers from our other partners as well. But we wanted to make sure that we reward users who are, you know, who believe in the vision that we share with Saga.
00:51:34.146 - 00:51:57.902, Speaker A: Super cool. It looks like maybe that some alpha in there. If this welcome pack could be, the stuff you interact with could be worth more than the phone itself in terms of. Because you said it's an open protocol, whose door do I have to kick down to get eth supported wallets on this? Is it like the developer of Metamask consensus? Is it higher up the stack? Lower down the stack? How would you think about that?
00:51:58.038 - 00:52:23.250, Speaker D: The key player here would be the wallets. And so someone like Metamask, for example, could integrate this technology and then basically publish that. Yes, I publish on a phone that this protocol exists, I support it. And here are the chains that I make available through this technology, then that would be something that adapt, could start consuming.
00:52:23.402 - 00:53:06.584, Speaker A: So why haven't. Maybe I'm just out of the loop here. Why haven't we heard any noise about any of these ETH based wallets, like a metamask, for instance, want to integrate what's, what's kind of the friction point here that's preventing us? Because I do think would be great for saga and Solana broadly. And all of crypto, to be honest, is a lot of money sitting in things like Ethereum and arbitrum. These l two s that are connected to the eVM, if they have a way to, you know, ape into pepe on their mobile device, theoretically, you know, then they could get exposure to Solana, too, which is a first class citizen of this device. It just seems like such a low hanging fruit. I mean, do you hear of any noise with some of these wallets on the east side wanting to build on the mobile adapter?
00:53:07.124 - 00:53:49.904, Speaker D: We've had a few people reach out to us with questions and explorations. I do think a lot of them are taking sort of a wait and see attitude. There was a certain amount of skepticism when we announced that we're building a phone. People were like, why? And then we tell them why, and they say, okay, interesting, but I'll believe it when I see it. And so now it's out there. Since we've released the phone, more and more people have been picking it up. And as they start to experience it, I do believe that we're going to see more openness to exploring some of the technologies we've built for this outside of just the core Solana ecosystem.
00:53:49.904 - 00:54:29.506, Speaker D: I think people wanted to see it was real, and I respect that. Know it did seem a little. I was working for a very traditional mobile devices company before I joined Solana Labs. And when I first got the call, I was like, this seems crazy. And then I thought about it for a little bit, and I said, this seems crazy, but at the same time, how can I not, possibly not want to be a part of this? And so it took me about a day to decide that this is something I wanted to do, and I wanted to jump in, both feed into. And I hope that as people experience what we built with saga, they go through that same sort of transition.
00:54:29.690 - 00:54:50.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an interesting point. At one point in my life, I had to make that jump into working in a crypto full time. And it just felt to me like working in computers in the seventies or working in the Internet. In the nineties, like, you just felt some energy there that you wanted. You knew you were early, there's no doubt, but you also felt like there was this really crazy future that you just wanted to hop in on at the right time.
00:54:50.714 - 00:55:01.974, Speaker D: Just look around this space and you see so many smart people doing so many cool things. You think, how can something amazing not come from this many crazy smart people contributing?
00:55:06.634 - 00:55:41.966, Speaker A: One kind of broader topic here is with this phone, right? It's $1,000. It's a very premium device. It's being launched, certainly, like, Solana is based in the US, and the US is a big market for crypto. How do you guys define success? What does success look like? Because it's obviously, it's a niche market. You know, expensive phone, smaller market in the US. Is this kind of just like a pilot for something to come? I mean, how do you guys define success? Is it just getting more people interested to develop on it, even outside of Solana? Is it kind of nudging someone like Apple even to maybe think about crypto more proactively? How do you define it?
00:55:42.050 - 00:56:04.798, Speaker D: I look at, like, there's like the long term success vector here, which is when there's nothing at all special about this device, when the capabilities of this device are just on every phone, because it's just taken for granted. That's like. That is my long term success. Right. In terms of the actual saga product, you know, it is. It is very much our testing the waters here. Right.
00:56:04.798 - 00:56:24.926, Speaker D: It's a. It is a little bit of a gamble. We want to find out what exactly people want. And we decided that the only way we could do it would be to jump in and actually build something here. And that's actually why we went with a premium device. A premium device. We wanted to show off the best of what crypto and web3 can be on mobile.
00:56:24.926 - 00:57:07.960, Speaker D: And to do that, we needed a great partner. We have a partner in awesome products who is developing the phone itself. Long experience in building really premium smartphone devices. And so the steel and ceramic casing of this, the, you know, just the weight and feel of it in your hand, like this is, you know, when people hear $1,000, they say, but that's how much a flagship phone costs. And you hold in your hand and you realize this is a flagship phone. So it's certainly. We're certainly targeting more than the US with this phone, available in 33 markets around the world, but they are markets that typically you would launch premium or flagship devices into.
00:57:07.960 - 00:57:50.418, Speaker D: So eu, US, Canada, UK, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand. So certainly market, it's not hitting all of the big smartphone markets around the world. There's a few big ones where crypto is popular that we would love to be able to launch a phone in, for example, India. But this device is not the right price point for that market. This is our flag in the ground. We want to say, build it, show people what it can be. And then we need to listen, we need to hear how the users of saga, and the users of SMS in general are sort of umbrella of technologies that are built into saga, but available to greater or lesser extents and other Android devices as well.
00:57:50.418 - 00:58:00.030, Speaker D: We want to see how those are received and we want to see where people take mobile development and that will inform any future decision. Product decisions we make for Solana Mobile.
00:58:00.182 - 00:58:30.658, Speaker C: 100%, this is a premium product. That's all I hear from people who have received it. But I think for some people, it's still a big leap. If you like to move away from an Apple, to move away from a Google whatever, they have to go to that premium product. And so a lot of people are saying, I'd rather use it as this second phone, really. But then $1,000 for a second phone during a bear market is a bit steep for some people. So I think I've heard Toly mention in an interview recently that awesome is next, or are doing a phone soon for about $300.
00:58:30.658 - 00:58:42.130, Speaker C: So I was just wondering, is that maybe the potential next step for going for a much more budget friendly phone, which could see far greater adoption?
00:58:42.282 - 00:59:14.688, Speaker D: So I can't comment on future product plans there, but we are exploring options that do include a cheaper version of like, a web3 phone. Don't even know what we would call it, whether it would be saga, whether it be something else. But we are exploring that amongst, you know, as we listen and as we see how people are using saga. So nothing new to announce right now on our product roadmap, but we, now that saga is out, we are talking internally, talking to partners, and talking to the community to figure out what comes next.
00:59:14.796 - 00:59:48.338, Speaker C: Can't blame a man for trying, trying to get that alpha. Something else I saw around the launch was some people were critical because they seemed to have this misconception that Solana were the hardware producers and saying that hardware is very difficult and you need these enormous budgets. But just to confirm once again, it's awesome, is the Osom, is the company which is behind this project? Yeah, it'd just be interesting to understand a little bit more about them, which phones they've worked on previously or any more about their background, really.
00:59:48.506 - 01:00:34.444, Speaker D: So the team at awesome has been that collectively amongst them, they have many, many, many years of mobile phone development experience on the hardware side and on the software side. Many of the individuals at awesome previously were working at Essential. If you remember essential, they had worked on the essential phone, which was kind of a pure Android flagship device. And so the CEO, Jason, also was previously worked at Apple. He was the architect of the iPad. And so brings a lot of that really premium hardware development experience to saga. And so this is the first product produced by awesome, but they have a long background in building these premium mobile devices.
01:00:34.834 - 01:00:49.414, Speaker A: Yeah, essential, that was the phone. That was Andy Rubin's phone right back in the day, it was supposed to be like that super, super premium. It never quite got off the ground, but it was pretty cool to see that. Big risk, for sure.
01:00:49.914 - 01:01:29.564, Speaker D: Absolutely some challenges there, but we're excited to have the experience that awesome brings. Building a phone is no small feat. Just so many things go into producing it. Just the list of certifications you need to acquire to be able to sell in all these different markets around the world. The amount of software certification you have to get, the number of carrier certifications you need to get to support selling and using this phone on mobile carriers worldwide is staggering. And on top of that, you actually have to build a hardware device. You have to work with contract manufacturers and factories.
01:01:29.564 - 01:01:45.812, Speaker D: You need to manage the logistics and operations, and then you actually need to write all the software and make it an actual phone beyond just a beautiful physical artifact you hold in your hand. So great partner and excited to be working with them on this.
01:01:45.948 - 01:02:01.760, Speaker A: Awesome is the manufacturing partner that you had a team on the Solana side that was working on this. What was your guys role specifically? And how on earth did you guys manage to push out this product so quickly? It seems, you know, just announced this past summer and less than a year later, we're holding in our hands.
01:02:01.832 - 01:02:46.078, Speaker D: So awesome was actually working on a phone before it was called the Ov one. And when we partnered with awesome, we kind of aligned on what we wanted to go into this device. So they were building a privacy focused phone that if you looked at the prototypes of that next to a saga, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between the two for very good reason. Yeah. But what Solana mobile brought to the table and built here are the crypto and web3 focus technologies. So everything that falls in the SMS umbrella seed vault, the mobile wallet adapter and the Solana DAP store, all three of those were either specified or built by Solana Mobile. Parts of it do need to be deeply integrated into the phone.
01:02:46.078 - 01:03:23.154, Speaker D: So seed vault, you know, we actually built Solana Mobile, built and designed the interfaces and the architecture for it. But much of the code was integrated deeply into the system layer by awesome as the phone manufacturer, whereas other parts, for example, the Solana Dapp store, that is built entirely by my team at Solana Mobile. And so all of this together, the whole Android phone, all the great hardware integration work that awesome does, and then the software work jointly done by Solana Mobile and awesome all came together to make this product.
01:03:23.454 - 01:04:23.138, Speaker C: It strikes me that someone needed to do this at some point, and it also seems very lucky, if you like, that the Solana team is just stacked with a load of ex Qualcomm engineers, where this was sort of their bread and butter, certainly for Tony, for ten years or so. So it just feels like this really good coming together, really, of software and hardware. And I'm not sure if any other of the major chains really could have done this endeavor. I think all power to the Solana team for going for it. If this doesn't work out in the end, if you struggle to sell loads and loads of phones, is this still a case that this has been an extremely good software play, if you like, because perhaps down the road, Apple and Android integrate some of these tools, and then Solana has sort of the premier software suite, if you like, for crypto on phones.
01:04:23.306 - 01:05:06.934, Speaker D: Well, I'll make a quick plug right now and say anyone who's listening should go and buy a saga that will absolutely help make this a successful product that we can then build on top of. But the Solana mobile stack, the technologies we built for this absolutely have value across mobile devices. It's, to me, coming from, I've been working on mobile devices for my entire 20 year career, or almost all of my 20 year career, and it's inevitable to me that crypto is going to be a first class citizen on mobile. There's no way. It can't be and target the world. And so someone needed to do this. It both seems like a crazy idea, but also it's something that just has to happen.
01:05:06.934 - 01:05:48.334, Speaker D: And it just needed someone to say, yes, we're willing to do that. And I think Solana has the network that can support the kind of interactions that are needed for developing a phone. And so it was just the vision of our founders to say, yes, we should absolutely do this. I hope that Saga has a huge, long run that we sell many, many devices, that there's many, many more future devices here as well. It's something that is foremost in my mind. I want to make sure that the success of Saga gives us the opportunities to keep building these new technologies. I'm an engineer.
01:05:48.334 - 01:06:05.754, Speaker D: I like technology. I like to build things. I will absolutely keep building all these cool mobile technologies, but I do think Saga is the best home for them. And so I've built many phones over my career, and this is the phone that I built that I'm the most excited about of anything I've ever worked on.
01:06:10.654 - 01:06:25.940, Speaker A: So, Stephen, before we wrap up, we'd love to just hear some closing thoughts. How do you envision this future of mobile crypto experiences? Do you think the next bull market will be kind of doing transactions from a mobile device? Or maybe is that a bit farther away? What do you think?
01:06:26.092 - 01:07:02.534, Speaker D: Where I think crypto is going to go is to a heterogeneous set of experiences. It should no longer be everyone experiences every activity in the web3 space in the same way. Through the lens of a web browser running on your MacBook, there should be, people are going to be gaming. Mobile is the perfect platform for gaming. People are going to be capturing their real life experiences, capturing photos and minting those as nfts. All of these things. They're going to want to do it on the go, and they're going to want to do it with the thing that they always have with them, their mobile phone.
01:07:02.534 - 01:07:49.394, Speaker D: The desktop crypto experience, is never going to go away, but it's going to be augmented by mobile devices. And my vision here is, honestly, the mobile should be taken for granted, just like you take your mobile for granted everywhere else. I want to get crypto and web3 on mobile to that point where you take the platform for granted and just have an expectation that you get those same great mobile experiences that you do for the rest of your life. Social gaming, browsing, entertainment, all of that should be brought to you on the best platform for it, which is the mobile device you already have with you. So, Saga, I think, is our, you know, this is our flag in the ground. This is us saying, let us show you how good this can be. And so that's, that's what I'm most excited about.
01:07:49.394 - 01:07:58.790, Speaker D: And I hope by the time the next bull market rolls around, that mobile is in a place to be a first party participant in that, in that next bull.
01:07:58.902 - 01:08:10.920, Speaker A: You heard it here first. Big predictions for the next bull market. Mobile hopefully will be an ally, but not necessarily a replacement for desktop crypto experiences. We hope to see that as well. Steven, thanks for joining us.
01:08:11.032 - 01:08:12.384, Speaker D: Thank you for having me. Appreciate it.
