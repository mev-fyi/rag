00:00:14.240 - 00:00:45.814, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we explore next gen blockchains and ecosystems. I'm your host, Saul, alongside my co host Dave. And today we're joined by Weedlechamp, one of the co founders of Mutant Mon, an NFT collection on Solana, a very innovative one at that. So, I mean, we have been talking mostly about meme coins, tokens and things like that. The last, I don't know, month, two months. So it's nice to kind of change it up. We think nfts are going to come back in a big way, especially with new emergent standards and ways of doing things.
00:00:45.814 - 00:00:50.354, Speaker A: So super excited to get into it with you today, Mister Champ.
00:00:50.934 - 00:00:57.314, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, thank you guys so much for having me, and excited to explore the future of nfts with you guys.
00:00:58.434 - 00:01:10.974, Speaker A: Sweet. I mean, I guess let's start with the foundations here. What makes Mutant Mon different from the thousands at this point of other classic 10,000 ppp collections?
00:01:12.514 - 00:01:39.024, Speaker B: Awesome. So Mutemon is the first spf 44. What we mean by spf 44 is it's a hybrid token. So people may have heard of Ghost, you may have for device bozo finance. And with hybrid tokens, there is a NFT impaired token with a liquidity pool. So in a sense, they kind of bridge nfts and meme coins together. That has all sorts of different advantages.
00:01:39.024 - 00:02:23.024, Speaker B: And we could dive into why hybrids are good, but with SPL four four, we're doing something different than what's come before, in that all of our nfts are unique. They have unique collectibility, unique utility. And whereas other projects in the hybrid space have really come from this, from a. The NFT side supports and improves the token size. We've come in it from the standpoint of, um, our protocol allows NFT collections to have, like, superpowers. So, like, we're really focusing on solving problems for NFT collections and NFT founders, which is the background of myself and everybody on the team.
00:02:25.004 - 00:02:33.104, Speaker A: You mentioned when we were talking earlier, this is an idea you've been incubating for a long time. I mean, maybe give us a bit more on the historical context here.
00:02:34.644 - 00:03:00.140, Speaker B: Yeah. So mutin Mon actually was a project I was thinking of in 2021 when I first learned about nfts. Actually, I've been playing around with nfts, uh, making money. And just like, you know, everything was euphoric in 2021. Do you remember, like, if you were able to mint something, it like, you know, 20 x that day, and you're. You're having a blast. And I just went these make so much sense.
00:03:00.140 - 00:03:36.772, Speaker B: This is so fun. I would love to do a collection around, uh, this type of art, which I call like, fusion mod, right? So I've been a fan of, uh, the pokemon fan game scene for a long time, at least, you know, type of fusion generators have existed that make these. And I coded my own in 2021. And I was just like, this would be also as NFT collection. I see, like, super collectible. But in the process of working on that, I released a different entity collection, Doggos. My first 1 December 5, 2021, at the, like, height of the bull market.
00:03:36.772 - 00:04:24.004, Speaker B: Solana was right around where it is now, like $210. It was a small 500 piece collection, and that did really well. And then my plan was, okay, let's get mutant mod online, let's get it going, and release that for the doggos holders. Well, turns out the bear market started coming on and things were going as well. And so I had to shelf pretty much the entire idea that I had about Yidmon and releasing this and this art. And it wasn't until we started having conversations around hybrid nfts in February, late January that I realized mutant mode was the perfect metaphor. You have these hybrids, they're visual hybrids.
00:04:24.004 - 00:04:39.988, Speaker B: So it's a visual metaphor for what a hybrid NFT is. Not only that, but it's exciting because it's something I've wanted to do and, like, it's something that's personally, like, very nostalgic for me.
00:04:40.036 - 00:04:40.172, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:40.188 - 00:04:54.144, Speaker B: And I think it's nostalgic for a lot of people. My web3 identity has been weedle champ since 2021, specifically because of this project that I've shelved. So it's really been a long time coming, and it just gives me a lot of joy to be able to work on it.
00:04:55.204 - 00:05:09.354, Speaker D: And so how does it broadly work? Let's try and get into the technical side of it, because previously we've had instantiations of fractionalizing nfts, none of which really got off the ground. So how does this work? How's it different?
00:05:10.614 - 00:05:17.206, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I'll say one key recent safray is that the NFTs don't remain the same.
00:05:17.270 - 00:05:17.446, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:17.470 - 00:05:35.544, Speaker B: So if you fractionalize an NFT, you can unfractualize it usually or get something out of the pool. That's the exact same with Youthmod. We have a really unique system, as far as I'm aware. It's like the first of its kind, where every time you move an entity out of the escrow system.
00:05:37.244 - 00:05:37.780, Speaker C: Maybe to.
00:05:37.812 - 00:06:36.944, Speaker B: Back up and explain what the escrow system, the way that the hybrid tokens work on Solana generally is that you'll have a fixed number of tokens and fixed number of nfts. In order to transfer the NFT tokens, you put your NFT into an escrow, and then you get tokens out of the token escrow and then vice versa, right. If you want to trade your tokens and for an NFT, put then tokens that you trade in go to an escrow, and then you get an NFT at escrow. With our system, every time NFT or Mutant Mon is released for tokens, it goes into our pool and we blank out the metadata, right? So there's no longer Vietnam. It's just a picture that says capturing Vietnam. And then every time you get an NFT out, we're going to reroll a whole new NFT. So imagine you've played a game, let's say, like Pokemon, right? Every time you step into the grass, you have an opportunity to catch something totally new with different stats.
00:06:36.944 - 00:07:14.504, Speaker B: Our NFCs have a lot of different variability. We even have soundtracks, but they have attack, defense, health, speed, luck, all these different game stats. So you're going to want to try to roll to get high, you know, a high setted min man. You're also going to want to try to chase rares, right? We have legendaries, we have shinies. There's all these highly collectible pieces that we have that we think really changes. Fractalization is something much, much more.
00:07:16.204 - 00:07:42.104, Speaker A: What the interplay with rarity here. Just to clarify, because you're saying the analogy here is you're almost releasing your Pokemon out once you swap for tokens. And so if it's a really rare one, you're just giving it back to the wild, so to speak. So is it the idea here if you have a really rare one, you wouldn't necessarily want to ever make it token again?
00:07:42.264 - 00:07:48.484, Speaker D: And what stops people from rerolling to try and get a rare one? Can't they just keep on going back and forth until they get a rare one?
00:07:49.104 - 00:08:19.344, Speaker B: Yeah, these are two great questions. So, a, with the rare one, you're right, you wouldn't reroll a rare one, just like you wouldn't fractionalize your rarest NFT, right? For example, the ovals. Right? They fractionalized Kleinosaurs, but you don't see any legendary kanasaurs in the fractalization pool. And in that way, it kind of makes the NFTs pseudo deflationary, especially if these are game pieces or utility pieces. And people have used for them, right. And they're rare. And back to the swapping thing.
00:08:19.344 - 00:08:36.644, Speaker B: We actually have a 2% tax on the swap and this is a big kind of innovation that we're pioneering in that up the 2% tax, half of it goes to our treasury. So 1% and then half of it gets burned.
00:08:36.984 - 00:08:37.680, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:37.832 - 00:09:05.664, Speaker B: So now we have a token that's naturally deflationary that we can use as our ecosystem token. In 2022, I led an anti developer development studio and we did staking for like a dozen or so projects. Like we helped them set it up, everything and they paid us. Almost everybody's tokenomics were inflationary.
00:09:05.964 - 00:09:06.660, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:06.812 - 00:09:08.812, Speaker B: I fell into this trap as well, you know.
00:09:08.828 - 00:09:09.076, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:09.140 - 00:09:13.492, Speaker B: I released staking where you sank the NFT, then you get tokens forever.
00:09:13.628 - 00:09:14.140, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:14.252 - 00:10:19.094, Speaker B: And that's useful cause you want to have a token because you want to be able to do things like auctions or sell merge or do all the different things people end up doing with their ecosystem tokens. But as a project founder, having an instantly inflationary token is like bad news bears because you're always having to figure out how do I burn these faster than they're emitting? It just puts a lot of negative price pressure in your token. Well, we figured out a schema where you can have an ecosystem token for your NFT collection, but now it's deflationary. I think we go from a place where your default dead. If you have a token that just instantly plays sharing, thats really hard to default alive, where now you have a token that every time its swapped or every time its traded just deflates. It puts a lot of pressure off you as project founder to scramble to figure out use cases for this token. Thats one half of the swapping, theres the 2%, the other half goes to the treasury.
00:10:19.094 - 00:10:52.584, Speaker B: And I think this is really important too because we've elected to not have any NFT royalties. So we're only collecting revenue from the swap fee and from a trading fee or transfer tax, weaving, driving revenue and driving volume, that these actions will actually end up netting us much more and much more sustainable revenue than current NFT collections are seeing. If youre an NFT collection owner, you know that youre not getting much money right now from royalties.
00:10:52.924 - 00:11:24.764, Speaker D: So I mean, it kind of makes me think about D gods. In the early days they had the paper hand bitch tax, which I think charged you 33% tax if you tried to sell underneath the floor price. And that sort of died a death even though it seemed a great idea because I think people just stopped selling under the floor. It killed the velocity, if you like, of the NFT. So is there a risk here? What will drive people to spend a 2% tax? Locking up their nfts and creating tokens? Is it going to be like arbitrage because the tokens are worth more, or do you see any other drivers that would get people to incur that tax?
00:11:25.664 - 00:12:02.148, Speaker B: Sure. So the 2% actually doesn't come when you transfer your nfts to tokens. It only comes when you transfer your mutant tokens back to mutant mod. So it's like a catch tax, let's say. And the reason people would pay that is because, again, you're going to have opportunities to reroll to higher rarity. You're going to, you know, when these. When we have a game that people can battle each other, they're going to try to get better mutant bond to battle each other, you know, so if we're driving utility to the NFT and making the metadata important enough, we think we're going to encourage a lot of swaps.
00:12:02.148 - 00:12:39.496, Speaker B: And, you know, frankly, people in crypto like gambling, you know, a 2% tax for an opportunity to get something better. I think a lot of people will do that. And we've seen really, like, encouraging results, even with just the eggs. And I think it's going to ramp up more. And just anecdotally, somebody told me the other day that they went on rollings free and like three x their money, they got a little lucky, but that's what they wanted to do. And so having that opportunity available, I think is really important because I think.
00:12:39.520 - 00:13:38.916, Speaker D: As well there is an arbitrage, because surely the price per token being traded as an SPL is not always going to exactly match the market cap, however, of the nfTs, how much the NFT is worth. So surely at some point it does go far enough that it's actually worth, worth doing that. Which, which I think is it great because nfts naturally get compressed like the sort of market caps that you can get with an NFT. I think the biggest one, Solana, obviously, is madlads. I think it's like 70 million, maybe I saw the other day, maybe imagine, maybe it's a bit more than that, but I think 70 million, and that's nothing. People are raising 30 million in 20 minutes today for a presale meme coin. So it does feel like a great way to tie the NFTs value to, like, a meme coins value, if you like, and provide the ability for lots of people to enter, which has always been a big negative of ten K PFP collections, while also having a deflationary implementation for the NFT.
00:13:38.916 - 00:13:45.184, Speaker D: So it seems really, really interesting. Is that how you're imagining it will unfold?
00:13:46.924 - 00:14:38.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's even more, id like to say about how nfts compare to meme coins. You take a collection like mad lads and theyve got about six and a half thousand, maybe call it 7000 holders, or you take bonk and theyve got 700,000 holders. At the end of the day, these tokens are actually very similar on the tech side. They run on the same Solana token program. They're both these online communities at the same time. The scale one can hit is just so much larger than the scale the other can hit. And with our schema, the plan is to greatly increase the number of NFT holders while not devaluing the collection.
00:14:38.404 - 00:15:26.864, Speaker B: So say for me and gen one, they're all tradable for 10,000 tokens piece. Let's say we want to have a gen two collection. Maybe they're tradable for 2000 tokens, and maybe a gen three collection, 500 tokens. In this way we can actually scale the NFTs infinitely, so long as they're tied to the same token, there's no devaluation going on. We think this is very important because you see collections you try to raise, well, let's put it this way. You see collections try to grow their holder base, whether it's SMB gen three or D gods with youths, or you'll even see yuga labs. They're buying moonbirds, they're buying other ip to try to get more holders in their ecosystem.
00:15:26.864 - 00:16:19.434, Speaker B: Because it's really hard to try to go to a community and try to grow the holder base by launching new projects, new nfts all the time. But I see an issue where, let's say you're SMB, you have holders all over the world, but maybe you don't have that many holders in non major cities for a meetup. Maybe you could do a meetup in New York, maybe you could do a meetup in LA, but maybe you can't do a meetup in Rio de Janeiro because you don't have enough people. Or maybe you can't do a meet up in Charlotte, North Carolina, right, by releasing SMB gen three, potentially SMB gen four, and by increasing the number of nfts out there that are PFT able, that people are saying like, this is my web3 digital identity, you could start to have a brand with much larger impact than anything we've seen in nfts before.
00:16:24.734 - 00:17:13.234, Speaker A: Let's talk about. You brought up SMB, and there's, I think, a proposal floating around about making season three hybridized. And I think they have this really good kind of graphic overview. But to your point that you made earlier, you can essentially like attach, you know, have some brand ip, whether it's SMB, whatever entity collection you want. You have kind of utility with the PFP use case. And then now you can introduce a token that allows to be able to kind of gamble even more on this idea of I can maybe capture or something really rare from this pool of nfts, which I think is going to be really powerful. And I've been saying for a while that these type of hybrid standards can take those behaviors, of speculative behaviors and put gas in the fire, so to speak.
00:17:13.234 - 00:17:39.344, Speaker A: Can you tell us a bit about just the mechanics with the token itself here? Where is supply being kind of created and burned? And how sustainable is this? I think meme coins are pretty straightforward. They just kind of created once, whereas this has a bit of intricacies with the tax system, burn mechanisms and then the ability to kind of swap them for an NFT and vice versa.
00:17:41.684 - 00:18:33.224, Speaker B: Yeah, so with SPL four for all the tokens on both sides are made at launch, so you'll never have more supply than there is on midday. And now you could have a stable supply. We've chosen to have a very slightly deflationary collection and a deflationary swap, but that's not necessary. In the last three weeks, we've bred 2% of the supply so far, which we think is very cool. We just think that kind of helps things. So in regards to monkey Dao, I don't think that was going to end up passing. I think there's a lot of confusion around it, and frankly, there's a lot of confusion around hybrid tokens and specifically what we're doing, which I think is like the next step of hybrid tokens.
00:18:33.224 - 00:19:22.534, Speaker B: I've talked to major players in the space, people with seven figures of NFT names that we would all know who've never even heard of hybrid tokens or hybrid nfts on Solana. So to get from not knowing anything about hybrids to all the way to SPL four four, and it's like a more advanced version of a hybrid, I think that's like a hard build swallow. And we're trying to obviously increase education. We could set up, if we're going to help a project, move to SPL four four or hybrid token standard. We could set it up in any way that the team deems like work the community wants, I guess you could say. It doesn't have to be deflationary. The tax is optional slash, you know, is changeable.
00:19:22.534 - 00:19:34.746, Speaker B: So there's really a lot of room to operate. I guess for me, what I see SPl four four is it's a hybrid token, right? So there's NFT that's attached to a coin.
00:19:34.810 - 00:19:35.010, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:35.042 - 00:20:14.676, Speaker B: So there's an exchange there. You could go back and forth. The metadata is all on chain. This is very important. And for it to be a true SPF 404, the NFTs need to be differentiated. Maybe they need to have some concept of rarity or uniqueness or unique collectibility to them. Now, with me, and we've obviously also decided to have this, uh, novel rerolling aspect, right? So you're not just getting a fractionalized NfT out of a pool, but you're getting a whole new NFt made with brand new metadata that didn't exist before you took it out of the escrow.
00:20:14.676 - 00:21:05.394, Speaker B: Um, I know with Smbgen three, it was discussed that we wouldn't do that. We wouldn't touch the old traits, because it does, you know, bring up questions about rarity and provenance and all these, you know, really deep questions that I think are really important for projects to grapple with. I will say, though, that there does also bring up opportunities to, if you're an older collection, to not necessarily change or remince traits that you have that are rare, but to introduce new traits into the pool. So, for example, when bitcoin hits 100k, maybe a hat that celebrates. It's only available for this week only. There's all sorts of ways to actually gamify this and make limited release traits just like they would in a game. Limited skins.
00:21:05.394 - 00:21:17.034, Speaker B: I'm told that there's Fortnite skins from the very early days that were tens of thousands of dollars. This sort of thing could come to nfts if we let it.
00:21:19.534 - 00:22:11.918, Speaker D: We were talking about this, actually on a recent podcast, your project, SPL 404. I think the line I said was basically, this is like supercharged meme coins. Because probably one of the issues we have currently with meme coins is you don't have a profile picture, so you can sort of post maybe a picture of one of the meme pictures, if you like, in your replies, but you can't rep it very easily as a profile picture. So I really do think it's like supercharged meme coins. And so the thing that just popped into my head is, do you not think maybe the way that this really explodes is if it launches as an split meme coin, which has the ability to be turned into nfts, rather than taking this, we're going to launch as an NFT, which then inherently seems to struggle in the current market, and then they can sort of be switched out as tokens. But, yeah, I think it'd be interesting if people switch that around the other way. Plus you'd be getting all your 2% tax as well on the whole collection.
00:22:12.006 - 00:22:45.582, Speaker B: Any thoughts on that? I think that's coming. I mean, Mutemon is one experiment and how this could work. And I'm talking to other collections and what their version of SPL 404 or their version of hybridization would look like. We're having a chunk of discussions that it's different. So, for example, with mutemon, at the current time, all NFTs are worth the same amount of tokens. You could experiment where different rarities are worth different amounts of tokens.
00:22:45.728 - 00:22:46.414, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:46.954 - 00:22:54.454, Speaker B: There's all sorts of experimentation that can happen, and we're really just opening up this can of worms for the first time.
00:22:55.874 - 00:23:02.014, Speaker A: Are you concerned at all about. You might get this question a lot, but just the similarity on the Ip side.
00:23:02.834 - 00:23:40.772, Speaker B: Bring it on. Yeah, yeah. Well, obviously nobody here is going to say, like, it's not inspired by Pokemon or it's not. Actually, we were, maybe it's called like, sprite bashing, right? So these are, you know, artists generated artworks. Like, I half programmatically made some of these, but we actually have three artists working to fuses. And there's a lot of artistic intention that goes on, whether people believe it or not. Even something like, you know, which, you know, assets to fuse together and such like that.
00:23:40.772 - 00:24:05.288, Speaker B: But there's all sorts of, like, artistic attention or artistic transformation that's going on here, which is my understanding of the law. Not only that, but we use part of the mint funds we've acquired, the council getting a memorandum to ensure that we are flying right in regards to all laws. But we've been very intentional from day one to not use copyrighted words. We're not using pikachu or poke balls or Pokemon.
00:24:05.436 - 00:24:06.124, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:06.424 - 00:24:52.184, Speaker B: I'm also very aware of every case that I've seen or could find that Pokemon has brought up in regards to problems with their ip. But every case that I could find has nothing to do with Fusion Mon, which have been popular in the fangame scene for a long time, which there's multiple projects online for years and one for more than a decade. Every project that I've seen that's had an issue is said, you know, this is Pokemon, these are poke, you know, and they use all the copyright words and they didn't change the assets. They do anything. So, you know, I guess that's kind of where we lay down on that. It's just like we're very aware of this. We're very intentional what we're doing.
00:24:52.184 - 00:24:59.074, Speaker B: We're transforming the assets and we're making sure that legally we're all covered.
00:24:59.574 - 00:25:11.350, Speaker D: You mentioned in the project blurb that you might be doing a launch pad as well. How fire progressed. Are you on that? Have you got any plans? Would you be taking revenue, sharing it with holders or.
00:25:11.422 - 00:25:12.994, Speaker B: Yeah, any plans on that?
00:25:13.814 - 00:25:14.246, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:14.310 - 00:25:47.976, Speaker B: So Launchpad is an interesting word for us to use to start. We do want to have a platform where anybody can get set up with their own SPF 44 project. Right. We want to help the existing NFT system move to this new standard, or I should say we should help the ecosystem move to this new standard. And we're doing a lot in that direction. What it's going to look like at first, though, is we're just going to partner with high quality projects. We've been in contact with a bunch of them, not just new projects, but some OG projects.
00:25:47.976 - 00:25:57.850, Speaker B: We've also been in contact with some coins to, to your point of like, hey, what if there's a coin? And now you have an nft side.
00:25:57.882 - 00:25:58.050, Speaker C: Right?
00:25:58.082 - 00:26:47.362, Speaker B: That's interesting. So it's going to be very high touch off the bat where we're going to work hand in hand with these projects to help them be successful, whether that's helping them with marketing or development work or just making sure they adopt the standard. So it's going to be very close partnership efforts. And so being very selective. Again, my history in 2022, the entire year, I ran lucky Dog studio with the other Dev of our project potato. And in 2022, I think I've helped more than 20 different projects launch, update their metadata, get staking rolling, do pretty much everything that was possible to do at an NFT collection of 2022. I did it for lots of projects.
00:26:47.362 - 00:27:50.634, Speaker B: So I'm very familiar with the idea of helping projects get to the finish line, get past finish line, be successful. So that's kind of like where I feel very comfortable. So I'm very excited about that opportunity. And then, yeah, as we move forward, we will be having more of a launchpad where it's more anybody can utilize it, right? And we're trying to open source a lot of the protocol or different tools that we may use as well. And in regards to rev share, obviously it's a very tricky subject to talk about rev share. However, we do want to make sure the benefits of launching all these other projects flow to our token holders and what that could look like not committing to anything here, but maybe a part of the fee is paid in mutant tokens and those get burned or something to that effect. There should be a flywheel here that as SPL four four succeeds, as our partners succeed, the holders will succeed.
00:27:55.854 - 00:28:24.764, Speaker A: Well, one topic you actually get into, or your team got into in the white paper is just the juxtaposition between nfts and meme coins. Just in your observation in the last, I don't know, a few years, Solana used to be all about nfts for speculation. That's basically all that happened. There was nothing happening with liquid token, that everything changed with this most recent cycle. Why do you think this happened? What happened here?
00:28:27.744 - 00:28:46.252, Speaker B: I think, frankly, NFT projects have been set up in an unsustainable way. There's been like a lot of, like, gotchas and then also a lot of projects launched during a time that looks vastly different than, you know, six or eight months ago or even today.
00:28:46.348 - 00:28:46.984, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:47.324 - 00:30:18.924, Speaker B: Um, I think a lot of people, including myself, you know, got into the space 21, 22 with the idea that things were going to be a steady ground in which to build on, right? And so that means, like, when you have a raise, let's say it means with a certain amount of money that you're like, that's, you know, that's going to carry me through to here, right, until I could do the next thing. But as interest is weighing during the bear market, as I said, 2022, I helped launch a bunch of collections for clients. But as the bear market went on, clients became fewer and fewer and fewer, and actually the quality went down and down and down of potential clients, right? And the amount of money, aka the amount of Runway, aka the grandeur of their vision, just decreased over time. And so it became a place that was really hard, really scrappy to be in. And, you know, we are also facing something where there's a lot of, I don't want to say copycat projects, maybe fast follow projects who they see a project doing one thing, and then you got four others who are like, trying to do that exact same thing, right? And so there's so much competition because it's such a low barrier to entry. But then there's also, like, no accountability. Maybe that's like the wrong word, but many collections just didn't live up to.
00:30:18.924 - 00:30:23.354, Speaker B: They're promised for a variety of reasons.
00:30:25.694 - 00:30:26.438, Speaker C: If you're going to be in an.
00:30:26.446 - 00:30:32.990, Speaker B: NFT collection or a meme coin, they both roughly have the same chance of working out. Unfortunately, at this point in time.
00:30:33.142 - 00:30:33.750, Speaker C: You know what I mean?
00:30:33.822 - 00:30:50.254, Speaker B: At least the meme coins generally pretty honest about it, right? We generally pretty much know this thing's going to zero. Probably. But is it going to 100,000,001st? Let's see. So, yeah, those are my thoughts.
00:30:52.514 - 00:31:16.044, Speaker A: Are you worried that if you guys rate this standard does really well, it's going to just create a flood of projects that are trying to capitalize on this without really embracing, I guess, the benefits to the user. All these old collections might start tacking on. All right, now we're going to hybridize collections that otherwise would have and should have maybe been dead.
00:31:18.344 - 00:31:29.080, Speaker B: I mean, I think that the standard is default, more sustainable, so that it could be a life raft to any project, any project sounder that's like hanging on and trying to build.
00:31:29.232 - 00:31:29.544, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:29.584 - 00:31:56.594, Speaker B: I actually have a bunch of respect for a lot of projects who I know don't have money, right. They don't have related treasury, but they have a small but active community, and they're just grinding it out. You know, they're like deeply underwater. So that this could be any sort of lifeline to help breathe new life into them, I think greatly outweighs for me any concerns I have that a bunch of other collections do it for the wrong reasons.
00:31:57.454 - 00:32:11.064, Speaker D: How's it going in terms of integrating with existing standards? The two that come to mind are, firstly, how, how is it integrating with the magic edens, the tensors of the world? And then the other one is NFT compression. Does it work with compression?
00:32:13.284 - 00:33:21.324, Speaker B: It can work through compression. I'm not to be frank, an expert in the compression, but it can work with CNFT's, et cetera. In regards to magic e to tensor, there's been a little bit of a hiccups in regards to marketplaces, but my conversations with the marketplaces are very frequent. The marketplaces actually see a world where this gets widely adopted and they're building towards that, and they've just been very, very supportive. And actually, what I would say, um, and, you know, you don't realize this when you go to launch it, you think when you go to launch, uh, a collection, like, yeah, it's just the marketplaces I have to worry about. But actually there's three other different pillars that I'd invite you to consider that aren't going quite as well. One, telegram bots in regards to the token side to the liquidity providers right now, most liquidity providers, meteora, orca, they don't currently support token 22 to token extensions.
00:33:21.324 - 00:34:03.960, Speaker B: So like, that's an issue. The liquidity providers that do, you know, it's not an optimal experience. Let's just say three wallets, right? Until for the first few weeks, Beatbon was out, you couldn't transfer an egg to another wallet. So phantom, I'm so happy that recently, now I'm able to actually transfer our tokens and our eggs in their wallet. Right? Adoption is moving across the board. Unfortunately, that has been a roadblock for us. You know, it just kept smacking us in the face like every day since we've launched.
00:34:03.960 - 00:34:22.004, Speaker B: Like, oh, it doesn't work here. Oh, it doesn't work here. Who do I got to talk to? Like, you know, how do we get in touch with these people to say like, hey, when's your timeline on, you know, adding Toka to a two support? So yeah, that's how Isaiah dot Fr is going. It's like repeatedly being sacked in the face, but it's getting better every day.
00:34:22.754 - 00:34:49.924, Speaker A: What about just the tokenomics and financial structure? How did you guys arrive at this breakdown? I'm on the dots now. It looks like 84% to the public, 10% to the liquidity pool, 4% to the team, 2% to the marketing. It feels like it's definitely. I mean, I'm not super familiar with how these traditionally break down for NFT collections, but what are your thoughts on that?
00:34:52.144 - 00:35:55.384, Speaker B: I would say in my experience, working with lots of different projects, it's all night up numbers. We're all trying to figure out what schema actually works. I'll say one thing that's not readily apparent with SPL four four and with von versus other projects is such a large percent of it actually ends up going to liquidity. That's something that you'll have to keep your eyes filled with as new collections come out. It's like, what percentage is actually going to the LP? So when we launched, we came on the heels of t 22 projects, which were mostly like meme coins with single nfts on the other side and no real long term plans. And they happen to be free, right? So the only hybrid on Solana that we're really competing with would launch a free collection with 21k supply. Or if they had any costs, it would go directly to the LP.
00:35:55.384 - 00:36:27.834, Speaker B: So knowing that we wanted to be in the game longer than that, we wanted to build. There's a lot we wanted to build. We needed to carve out a small but significant portion, uh, to. Of go to our treasury so that we could actually fund, uh, the four core team members. We also have several other, uh, team members and people that we work with, whether that's our artists. You know, we have three artists. Uh, Dara Molov is making the music, uh, you know, mods, uh, and Telegram, which, which are important as well.
00:36:27.834 - 00:36:47.974, Speaker B: So we wanted to be sustainable there. But, yeah, 42% of the LP, I think currently we have something like 400 to 500,000 TvL. So we think that's, like, deep enough. So that's really differentiated from NFT liquidity.
00:36:48.054 - 00:36:48.342, Speaker C: Right?
00:36:48.398 - 00:36:55.154, Speaker B: Like, it's a much, much cheaper liquidity than nfts. And we just thought that was kind of right for the coin side of things.
00:36:56.774 - 00:37:14.404, Speaker D: I think something like this is happening on Ethereum as well as I understand it. So ERC 404, I think Pandora has done very well, from my understanding. Do you know much about that? And do you think there's any advantages which you can gain from being on Solana versus those guys on Ethereum?
00:37:15.304 - 00:37:33.148, Speaker B: Yeah, I do know about Pandora, and I'd be like, I did say they were actually a huge inspiration. Pandora was one of those websites and white papers and twitters that I read over and over again. And preparation for me and mon be like, okay, like, how are these people thinking about what they're doing?
00:37:33.196 - 00:37:33.764, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:33.924 - 00:38:20.542, Speaker B: Um, along with, you know, bozo finance on Solana and ghosts on Solana and other projects. Solana. But Pandora was obviously a huge inspiration because their innovation was, hey, when you swap, you get a different rarity, right? You get a new NFT and you're like, oh, that really does unlock so much. And Pandora gangbusters, it got to, like, number one as far as Ethereum, nfTs, obviously, SPL 404, that name is inspired by ERC 404. Now, I guess, one last thing. We were able to meet the team at Denver, and they're very nice, and we congratulated them, they congratulated us, but they're really doing things big on the Ethereum side. So all congratulations to that team.
00:38:20.542 - 00:38:52.762, Speaker B: Um, we're different in a few ways. We actually don't functionally work, uh, very similar with Pandora. Every time you trade the token, the NFT kind of like, trade together. There's not this, like, it's just like a very different system. But the thing that they innovated on that we picked up was the new rarity. Um, as far as trading, uh, Ethereum versus Solana, I think we obviously have a huge advantage. I dont want to trade mucoins or anything on Ethereum personally.
00:38:52.762 - 00:39:12.542, Speaker B: I just dont want to pay gas. Thats not something that appeals to me in the least. Obviously Im maybe Im very biased, but I just think Solana is much superior for world NFT and coin trading and.
00:39:12.558 - 00:39:14.034, Speaker D: More eyeballs at the moment.
00:39:15.534 - 00:39:36.318, Speaker B: Oh yeah. I mean, it's crazy how many eyeballs you get when a number go up, right? And number has been going up. I was just in a Twitter space for the token. I think it's slur. Who. They burned $10 million of their lp on our. Whoops.
00:39:36.318 - 00:39:51.984, Speaker B: Like they burned all the tokens. They were staying airdropped. And there's like 10,000, 11,000 people in the space. Like, when's the last time that happened? And I, people were saying I'm in space. It's like this hasn't happened in years, right? Like this sort of crazy activity. So.
00:39:54.604 - 00:40:10.324, Speaker A: What'S like the high level, I guess, difference between you mentioned, like some other ones, like ghost bozo versus what you guys are doing? And is there, is the spl four four probably going to be like de facto winner here for hybridization?
00:40:12.184 - 00:41:00.354, Speaker B: Uh, I think whatever wins will look a lot more like us for nfts, uh, front of t collections than the existing collections. Um, the other collections really came at this token first because let's face it, you know, meme coins and tokens, that is the hotness right now, right? And so the NFTs were, had different sort of utility, when you think about it, from a meme coder token first, right? Where we're really different is we take things or we look at things through the eyes of a project founder, right? Like, what problems does this solve for a DJ and ape academy or for the next, you know, great project on Solana?
00:41:01.614 - 00:41:08.510, Speaker A: I say it's healthier for the NFT collection. So that's coming in from that perspective, right?
00:41:08.542 - 00:41:20.406, Speaker B: I mean, with these other projects, they don't have any idea of rerolling for new rarity, for example, right? That, that's unique for the SPF 44. Their nfts look the same, which that.
00:41:20.430 - 00:41:30.204, Speaker D: For me, that is the biggest issue, that they're all exactly the same picture. Unless they're doing a big reveal. Like, it's just not an NFT collection, it's just a picture in your wallet.
00:41:30.744 - 00:42:09.744, Speaker B: It's not an NFT collection, it's a wrapped fungible token because non fungible means it's not exchangeable, whereas fungible means there's essentially the same. When you do a swap for t 22, you'll notice that you don't have to choose which NFT to swap because it doesn't matter. So if it doesn't matter which nft you swap, then you don't really have an NFT collection. And that's no shade to any of the t 22 projects or hyper projects came before because they be 100% clear here. Mute model would not exist for these projects leading the way. So I want to give them all props there.
00:42:15.644 - 00:42:33.414, Speaker A: One of the topic I want to dive into is just kind of the state of marketplaces, specifically in Solana side. I think it's always been this tug of war we're seeing with tensor metric Eden. But as a creator and a builder in this space, what's your read on marketplaces right now?
00:42:36.554 - 00:43:28.284, Speaker B: I guess I have a couple of thoughts on marketplaces. One is shout outs to sniper who have been leading the charge on the hybrid side. You know, they, they're really active in trying to push this hybrid forward. Um, and I think it's because they kind of seen where this is going, I think with hybrids. Um, let me be clear, all the marketplace has been really fantastic to work with and talk to. But uh, if you think about it, if liquidity and volume move to the token side of these assets, right, if most projects become hybrid nfts and the liquidity is on the token side, that might eat at NFT royalties. Obviously, weve chosen to take zero NFT royalties because we think were going to make more money on the token volume side.
00:43:28.284 - 00:43:43.440, Speaker B: So thats what were trying to push. And obviously theres also opportunity to make money in the LP side. So id match where marketplaces are going to end up going is that they're going to want to have access to both sides of these collections.
00:43:43.512 - 00:43:43.816, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:43.880 - 00:44:01.632, Speaker B: Let's say the SMB gen three proposal did go through, right? Now, XYZ marketplace might not just need to sell you the NFT, but they might also host the swap where they might also sell you the token, the SMB three token.
00:44:01.768 - 00:44:02.400, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:02.552 - 00:44:41.314, Speaker B: And I think thats a radical shift for how we think about nfts going forward. But I also think its very healthy. Again, the token side isnt a gimmick. I really think a lot of ecosystems in this space have interesting use cases for the tokens themselves. Beyond being just swappable, there are lots of things that you could do with the token and a lot of flexibility that opens up. So I think its just going to be an option that people are going to choose going forward. If youre launching an NFT collection, I think by the end of the year itll be the default way to launch an NFT collection.
00:44:41.314 - 00:44:46.074, Speaker B: And if thats true, I think marketplace is going to need to change dramatically.
00:44:47.574 - 00:45:09.614, Speaker D: That is interesting. I think tensor originally wanted to be a limit order book for nfts from memory, and then they realized there wasnt really a market for it. I'd imagine they'd probably be licking their lips at that possibility. I mean, I also just heard them on a podcast with the Jupiter guys and they were sort of like, we'll be the non fungible side. Jupiter are going to be the fungible side. But I wonder if that's going to bring them in direct competition with each other.
00:45:10.794 - 00:45:23.754, Speaker B: Well, I'll tell you, I think the tensor team is very smart. I think what they tried to do in regards to adding liquidity to nfts is very smart. And I think this just turbocharges that whole initiative and directive.
00:45:23.794 - 00:45:23.970, Speaker C: Right.
00:45:24.002 - 00:45:58.634, Speaker B: Liquidity gets way deeper. Would you start to have a real LP, right. And once you're not dealing with single like nfts but you're dealing with, you know, the tokenized version, I'll say I think it's going to be a little bit knives out in regards to people stepping on to each other's businesses, let's say, right. You know, people who are nice and work gathering a cooperative today might see themselves being competitors tomorrow.
00:46:01.694 - 00:46:11.234, Speaker A: Are you saying that NFT marketplaces are going to start looking like bird eye, for instance, are we merging?
00:46:12.094 - 00:46:17.634, Speaker B: I'm telling you that I was the CEO of an NFT marketplace. That's exactly what I would be doing.
00:46:18.274 - 00:46:18.850, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:18.962 - 00:46:19.978, Speaker B: Let me give you another stack.
00:46:20.026 - 00:46:20.642, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:20.818 - 00:46:29.674, Speaker B: I heard this on the other day that NFT on Solana do about $15 million of volume a day and defi in Solana does over 2 billion.
00:46:29.794 - 00:46:30.266, Speaker C: Right?
00:46:30.370 - 00:46:39.922, Speaker B: Again, I looked at the bonk stats. Bonk did more volume in one day. Twice as much volume in one day as the entirety of Solana nfts.
00:46:39.978 - 00:46:40.410, Speaker C: Right?
00:46:40.522 - 00:47:04.694, Speaker B: So box doing twice as much volume. Right. If there's an excuse for the NFT people to get into the token game to that trading game, I think you take it because I think there's going to be a lot of money to be made, especially if you take it from the, I want to help the whole ecosystem of an NFT.
00:47:04.774 - 00:47:05.062, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:05.118 - 00:47:11.002, Speaker B: I don't want to just help the heist but I want to say sell their nano token as well.
00:47:11.098 - 00:47:11.594, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:11.714 - 00:47:17.514, Speaker B: And anything that I could do to support the heist ecosystem, I'm going to do under my umbrella.
00:47:17.634 - 00:47:18.934, Speaker D: It's got good narrative.
00:47:19.634 - 00:47:31.138, Speaker B: Honestly, it's exciting. It's like fireworks. Like, I'm excited to see where this goes because I could just sense that there's got to be change, right? There's got to be change in the NFT collection side, because frankly, it doesn't work.
00:47:31.186 - 00:47:31.394, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:31.434 - 00:47:50.684, Speaker B: We're seeing it now. The collections are bleeding. Very few being seen. NfTs keep underperforming meme coins. It's a little bit of a spiral effect. It's harder and harder to call back up. So they really need to transform.
00:47:53.784 - 00:47:54.096, Speaker C: What.
00:47:54.120 - 00:48:03.942, Speaker B: They'Re doing to try to get back in the game. If you're trying to compete for attention, if you just take it as these two categories competing for attention for the crypto degens, NFTs are losing and need.
00:48:03.958 - 00:48:14.994, Speaker D: To change because also you're quoting volume numbers. But as we know, magic eat and tensor are both doing airdrop incentives at the moment. So the real volume is probably like one 10th of that.
00:48:17.414 - 00:48:35.924, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, think of the insanity. We have wallets getting sent soul to launch a coin that nobody's ever seen or heard or from people nobody knows that are larger than the market cap of established nfts that have been working for two, three years.
00:48:36.704 - 00:48:37.112, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:37.168 - 00:48:59.054, Speaker B: Like, they're just literally getting sense. Solana, that's more than the whole market cap of major NFT collections that have been here for multiple years. Like, you just let that sink in. You're like, oh, this is a really bad spot to be in for nfts. Like, if it's gotten this bad and it really has, things need to change.
00:49:01.274 - 00:49:14.814, Speaker A: Definitely. They definitely do. They also just need to be more than tradable speculative assets. Because to your point, yeah, tokens just are doing that way more elegantly, and people are resonating with tokens more.
00:49:15.594 - 00:49:56.116, Speaker B: And to put it another way, when I was comparing, let's say, mad lads to bonk, where you take any NFT collection, I don't want to pick up mad. That bonk has a real community of 700,000 holders, right? Their holders, they are making memes. You know, there are people with it in their profile. Like, you know, people are actually passionate about bulk and want to be part of that community. You know, we could have it. So, you know, they also have a PFP or there's also like an entity. There's like more layers there than just a traditional coin would give you right now you have additional community layers, whether that's.
00:49:56.116 - 00:50:13.812, Speaker B: I know there's all sorts of millionaire and billionaire chats for coins. Let's say you're a chunky billionaire. Maybe there's a secret cabal chat, something where an NFT had wrapped a billion tokens now makes it very easy for you to use Matrika or something to token gate a discord.
00:50:13.908 - 00:50:14.398, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:14.516 - 00:50:19.746, Speaker B: So there are actually utility plays between the NFT and token site as well. Awesome.
00:50:19.770 - 00:50:50.744, Speaker A: Well, we covered a lot of topics on this idea of generative semi fungible collections in Solana with the 404 standard and this idea of just mixing the liquidity of meme coin with collectability rarity of NFT projects. So I guess the closing question here, looking forward, how do you see this kind of new primitive plot playing out? Do you think it gets adopted beyond just people like us that are trading on the speculative side? How do you see this evolving?
00:50:52.524 - 00:51:09.936, Speaker B: Honestly, I think there's going to be a lot of experiments in this space, and some have already been successful. I would say pretty much every hybrid experiment that's been run on Solana has been successful to some degree, but I think the experiments are going to get bigger, bolder and more in your face.
00:51:10.080 - 00:51:10.456, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:10.520 - 00:51:30.776, Speaker B: I think, you know, we're picking up attention from major platforms. People are really starting to learn what hybrids are. Um, and I could see either major existing OG collections or even whole platforms try to shift towards this model.
00:51:30.880 - 00:51:31.096, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:31.120 - 00:51:43.854, Speaker B: And get vocal about it, too. Uh, and I think as that happens and as we close the education gap, my dearest hope is that that's going to breathe new life into the entire NFT ecosystem.
00:51:45.554 - 00:52:02.054, Speaker A: I think you're right on the money. It feels to me this is probably one of those primitives that will just set the world on fire. Once retail really starts getting involved and people are starting to trade a lot, I'm pretty excited by it. We really appreciate you coming on and helping us demystify everything here.
00:52:02.934 - 00:52:12.662, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I guess one last thing is, I think mutant Munn is going to be the project that sets the world on fire. Right now we're eggs. And I think people are like, I don't get it.
00:52:12.758 - 00:52:13.086, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:13.150 - 00:53:15.186, Speaker B: Frankly. Frankly, they're like, I don't get it. But to give you a hint to, like, where this is going, once you had mutant month and like, now you need a squad of six or three, and now you've got to battle each other, right? And there's like a transparent battling system. But maybe, maybe you could wager you know, maybe it's the next dj coin flip, you know, and you could wager and battle each other and we're building, you know, potentially a game inside of discord or Twitter or, excuse me, not Twitter, telegram. I think there's a lot of exciting things once you get this whole like Pvp aspect. They think meme coins really capture very well is people know when they open bird's eye or they open bonkbot like hey, this is PvP baby, like but once we have that little element to meet mon and people are really incentivized to reroll and they really see the power of like oh wow, this is like a whole little engine that's driving this NfT collection and it's going to open a lot of eyes. So that's the goal.

00:53:22.978 - 00:53:24.484, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you guys so much. Peace.
