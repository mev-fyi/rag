00:00:00.480 - 00:00:17.434, Speaker A: What is your 10,000 foot view on where social, particularly text based networks like Twitter and now threads came out? How do you think this is shaking out in the next 510 years? Is crypto going to be a big part of it? Are you bullish things like lens? Is there another piece that maybe people are missing here?
00:00:17.974 - 00:00:19.154, Speaker B: It's a good question.
00:00:19.774 - 00:00:24.046, Speaker C: I think what people fail to realize a lot of the times is that crypto is a social game.
00:00:24.110 - 00:00:26.172, Speaker B: And it's a social experiment mostly.
00:00:26.318 - 00:00:35.640, Speaker C: You know, like the only way something ever becomes popular, and whether it's about awareness or really whether it's about floor.
00:00:35.672 - 00:00:39.960, Speaker B: Price going up for an NFT or price going up for a coin, it's through social awareness.
00:00:40.112 - 00:00:42.288, Speaker C: Like, you never really see a coin.
00:00:42.336 - 00:00:52.116, Speaker B: Just go absolutely ballistic or an NFT go crazy that isn't regularly talked about or have a very large community in specifically the Twitter realm per se, you.
00:00:52.140 - 00:01:00.020, Speaker C: Know, and so I'm very, very, like, that's like, my main observation of all this stuff. It's how I, like, do trading analysis.
00:01:00.092 - 00:01:16.104, Speaker B: Like, I don't necessarily do a lot of ta. I know how to do ta on a very basic level, but I don't do a lot of it because I mostly just analyze social trends and I say, oh, wow, this has a large community. It's growing, it's popular. Maybe I should spend some time and energy there and, like, observe it more.
00:01:16.604 - 00:01:20.406, Speaker C: And I think that's kind of why. Why crypto is fun is because it.
00:01:20.430 - 00:01:22.166, Speaker D: Gives you the capacity to kind of.
00:01:22.230 - 00:01:23.878, Speaker B: Interface with a whole group of people.
00:01:23.966 - 00:01:28.190, Speaker C: Who you've never been able to interface with before, who you don't even know.
00:01:28.222 - 00:01:32.234, Speaker B: About or who you might be just getting to learn about all this different stuff.
00:01:33.054 - 00:01:36.878, Speaker C: So, yeah, kind of lead it back to your question. I think. I think it plays a major role.
00:01:36.926 - 00:01:38.270, Speaker B: I don't know how it's going to.
00:01:38.302 - 00:01:40.286, Speaker C: Eventually into the future, but I think.
00:01:40.430 - 00:01:42.102, Speaker B: As I, as I watch and observe.
00:01:42.118 - 00:01:58.690, Speaker C: It more, it's becoming, while there's a lot of meme coins and all this other stuff, I think it's actually becoming more intellectual. You know, there are subsets of people that form around meme coins and stuff like that, but a lot of the people are becoming actually interested in the.
00:01:58.722 - 00:02:06.214, Speaker B: Technology, what it does, how it works, how it interfaces, how it brings value, utility, etcetera, to the ecosystem and beyond.
00:02:06.514 - 00:02:10.082, Speaker C: And the more that, like, the group of individuals that are interfacing around certain.
00:02:10.138 - 00:02:12.146, Speaker B: Projects or communities as a whole, start.
00:02:12.170 - 00:02:13.426, Speaker C: To think is like, a little bit.
00:02:13.450 - 00:02:18.340, Speaker B: More intellectually and not just on the meme side, I think it grows.
00:02:18.532 - 00:02:20.404, Speaker C: That being said, like, the meme meme.
00:02:20.404 - 00:02:22.260, Speaker B: Of occasion of it is fucking awesome.
00:02:22.372 - 00:02:23.064, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:23.404 - 00:02:26.180, Speaker C: That's actually what I think makes people.
00:02:26.292 - 00:02:28.388, Speaker B: Like, come into the industry more.
00:02:28.476 - 00:02:29.660, Speaker C: You know, a lot of people, like.
00:02:29.692 - 00:02:30.900, Speaker B: On Twitter, like, oh, this is.
00:02:30.932 - 00:02:33.784, Speaker D: All these meme coins are ruining crypto.
00:02:34.604 - 00:02:39.716, Speaker C: But I actually think it's the opposite. I think that that's what makes it interesting to the normies and to the.
00:02:39.740 - 00:02:42.770, Speaker B: People who haven't interfaced with the technology before.
00:02:42.922 - 00:02:44.362, Speaker C: Like, those guys, like, people who are.
00:02:44.378 - 00:02:48.082, Speaker B: Coming into crypto don't give a fuck about transactions per second.
00:02:48.218 - 00:02:50.554, Speaker C: They don't care if your blockchain can't.
00:02:50.594 - 00:02:53.610, Speaker B: Is interoperable or if it's immutable.
00:02:53.722 - 00:02:54.842, Speaker C: They don't even know what those words.
00:02:54.898 - 00:03:06.154, Speaker D: Mean, you know, they care that Harry Potter, Sonic Obama, ten enu coin as a fucking guy running around in a blue hedgehog costume, like, and making everybody laugh.
00:03:06.274 - 00:03:07.428, Speaker C: That's what interfaces are.
00:03:07.466 - 00:03:11.152, Speaker D: They like Dogecoin, because there's some doge.
00:03:11.208 - 00:03:17.536, Speaker C: On all these posters and memes and Elon's tweeting about it. That's like, that's what catches the attention first.
00:03:17.640 - 00:03:19.084, Speaker B: It's what interests people.
00:03:19.904 - 00:03:21.296, Speaker C: So I think they both have, like.
00:03:21.320 - 00:03:22.984, Speaker B: A unique balance in the industry.
00:03:23.064 - 00:03:25.688, Speaker C: But as the industry evolves, I'm seeing.
00:03:25.736 - 00:03:29.840, Speaker B: More and more people actually care about what the technology, what it does, why.
00:03:29.872 - 00:03:37.806, Speaker C: It'S better than other technologies. And people are at least this bear market to the bull market. I'm observing more people studying the actual.
00:03:37.870 - 00:03:40.894, Speaker B: Technology and making investment decisions based off of that technology.
