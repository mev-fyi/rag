00:00:14.440 - 00:00:50.694, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we explore next generation blockchains. I'm your host, Saul, and it's just me today, but we have a very special episode, one that I think is timely for a lot of our listeners as we approach tax season. The tax deadline of April 15, or maybe that's a slight date, but mid April. Today we're speaking with Patrick Camuso, managing director of Camuso CPA. He's been a crypto focused CPA since 2016 and expert on this topic. And I think a lot of our listeners will just get a lot of value out of listening to an expert's view on how to handle crypto taxes. It's an important issue.
00:00:50.694 - 00:00:59.972, Speaker A: It's a challenging and complex one, depending depending on, on what kinds of trading activities you're doing. And we're super excited to just get into the weeds here. Patrick, welcome to Unlayer.
00:01:00.148 - 00:01:02.064, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on. I appreciate it.
00:01:03.444 - 00:01:28.694, Speaker A: Absolutely, absolutely. Thanks for taking the time during what I'm sure is a busy season for you. I want to start this just with some really basic level primitives and knowledge of how to think about this. Let's start with this. What makes crypto different from taxes for something like trading stocks or any sort of asset class, what makes this kind of a unique and in some ways difficult beast to manage?
00:01:29.394 - 00:02:12.548, Speaker B: Sure. Well, ultimately, you know, it comes down to, in a large part, the self custody component of cryptocurrency. As a result, there's not going to be one centralized place that is going to have access to all of your transactions and all of your cost basis information. So, you know, if you're just trading more traditional securities, usually you're going to get a 1099 in the mail in. For the most part, that 1099 is going to be accurate other than just for more fringe cases. And you can basically rely on that as a CPA in order to file taxes. But when it comes to cryptocurrency, you know, you may be trading across multiple centralized exchanges along with, you know, multiple non custodial wallets.
00:02:12.548 - 00:02:44.804, Speaker B: And when you're transferring these cryptos between each one, right now there's no data sharing mechanism between all of your wallets and all the exchanges. So then the responsibility starts to fall on you as the taxpayer to start to produce your own accounting system in order to ensure that you're accurately calculating this and file filing taxes. So it starts to take a lot of the reporting that you used to have your brokers doing for you, and it starts to push that burden more onto you.
00:02:45.224 - 00:03:02.992, Speaker A: Right. Right. So definitely a big challenge for just managing all the different data sources. And as you add more chains, there's different infrastructure, wallet providers, et cetera. That makes it exponentially more complex. Let's talk about just the idea of crypto taxes. I believe the IR's recognizes them as more like property.
00:03:02.992 - 00:03:20.684, Speaker A: For some reason, this hasn't really changed since 2014. So is that correct to assume that? And based on that, how are we, what constitutes a taxable event for people? What's not a taxable event? And what's like the tax rate for crypto?
00:03:20.844 - 00:04:25.916, Speaker B: Yep, it is correct. It is tax as property. Most cryptocurrencies are taxed as property. Now, can that evolve in the future as the market evolves and we start to see securities get issued on chain and we start to see non fungible tokens possibly representative of real world assets? You know, this is going to get more complex, I believe, from a tax perspective, and we have seen some indications of that. But generally speaking, yes, you know, cryptocurrency is taxes property, especially if we're talking about just a fungible crypto like bitcoin or ethereum. And it does come with some significant tax implications that, you know, a lot of people, especially years ago, were not very pleased with. And basically, you know, anytime that you're going to relinquish one cryptocurrency for value, let's say, because, you know, this value can take the form of treating one cryptocurrency for another, or treating cryptocurrency in a, in a transaction, maybe buying a pack of gum at a grocery store, or, you know, it can take many forms.
00:04:25.916 - 00:05:19.650, Speaker B: So basically, if you're going to trade, exchange, or spend a cryptocurrency, it's going to have a taxable event. So, you know, an example of if you on rail via centralized exchange, purchase Ethereum and then transfer that Ethereum to a non custodial wallet and start making transactions where you're exchanging Ethereum for other cryptocurrencies, you know, most likely these are going to be taxable events. And it's important for people to understand that going in because, you know, oftentimes I can see people that are unaware of that now that's been much more historically, they're unaware of it. But still to this day, we can see that. And then, you know, you can be making these on chain transactions during bull market. Even if you are aware that they're taxable and you're not tracking it, this can start to get away from you. And these on chain transactions where you're having taxable transactions, for instance, with Ethereum or Solana, and it just constantly is going up in price, that can start to add up quickly.
00:05:19.650 - 00:05:22.154, Speaker B: So you want to make sure that you're aware of that.
00:05:22.194 - 00:05:43.714, Speaker A: Consider that for sure. For sure. And how do you think about. I think taxes were a lot easier for crypto when it was just bitcoin or ethereum, or even when it was just tokens. Now we have airdrops, we have nfts. How are we thinking about these new primitives that are very commonplace compared to just a few years ago?
00:05:44.134 - 00:06:34.176, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I look at each one individually on a client by client basis. I really think that's the only way you can take it. So I started, like you said, back in 2016, and back then it was much more straightforward. I was mainly working with bitcoin investors and Ethereum investors and miners mostly. And then we saw the proliferation of ICos, then the proliferation of blockchains, then DeFi nfts, and now web3. And with each step of this, and it seems like with each bull cycle, we see new innovation, new protocols, new assets, new ways of doing business. So you really have to take it step by step and make sure that whatever the asset type is or the specific protocol that you're looking at, you understand the mechanisms of it, and then you can start to build a tax position around it.
00:06:34.176 - 00:07:10.054, Speaker B: And usually when you are building a tax position around it, you want to first come with that level of understanding and then look at tax regulations that are going to apply to that, to build a reasonable tax position that's more likely than not to stand up to an audit. And lastly, you want to contemporaneously document that. So just make good notes to, to document the tax position in reasons that you can use to support it. And that's really the approach. You really got to take it step by step and make sure that you're staying on top of all these new changes as well.
00:07:11.314 - 00:07:31.004, Speaker A: Understood. Let's maybe get into some examples to help illustrate some of these concepts. Let's start with this. You were farming some protocol on Solana or whatever chain, and you got an airdrop, and maybe that airdrop was tens of thousands. What is the taxable event and what would be the theoretical tax rate for that?
00:07:31.944 - 00:08:04.754, Speaker B: Yes, so that's a great question. And this is also an important consideration. Cause this sort of takes into an account, a tax plan, because when you receive that airdrop, it's going to be taxable to you at the date and time that you receive it. And did the level of tax that you're going to pay is going to be income taxes based off of the fair market value at that time. So that's what you're going to pay. You're going to pay income taxes on that. And then what that would do is it would also set your cost basis in that asset.
00:08:04.754 - 00:08:32.574, Speaker B: So say you get airdrop $10,000, you're going to have, you know, $10,000 of income. Let's say you're paying, you know, 30, 40% tax on that. Let's say you have a, a three k, um, tax liability based off of that. Now that, that ten k income also is going to establish your cost basis. So say you immediately go and you sell that airdrop. You know, it gets airdropped for ten k and then you sell it for ten k. That's $0 of capital gains income.
00:08:32.574 - 00:09:17.556, Speaker B: But say you hold it, then there can be a capital gain or a capital loss depending on, on the direction that this goes. But one consideration around this is, you know, picture a scenario where you get airdrop ten k and you're going to have a three k tax liability. And then, you know, you, you go and you sell it for a loss, you're going to have a five k loss. Now, that full five k loss, you're not going to be able to use against that three k because that five k loss is going to be capital in nature versus your ordinary income. So that will get limited to just three k if you don't have other gains to use against it. So you want to be aware of that. And I believe best practice just from, you know, what I've seen is to stay on top of the accounting for your portfolios.
00:09:17.556 - 00:10:06.154, Speaker B: And when you are receiving income or you're triggering capital gains, you want to remove whatever your tax liability is from the validity risk of the markets. Because what I do is inevitably see, each cycle is people, they get you all this euphoria during each bull cycle and everyone feels like it's never going to come down. And then it feels like, you know, bear markets always come right before tax season. And then sometimes, you know, if you're, if you're holding off your tax liabilities in Solana and then a bear market comes in December and you're in March and you're looking to pay taxes in, you know, April or January, you know, and Solana took a 50% drop, you're going to be sucking in a position where you may have to liquidate double the amount of it just to pay your taxes, and I see that every cycle. So you want to avoid that.
00:10:06.614 - 00:10:57.062, Speaker A: So you made a really important distinction here, which I want to focus in on for a bit, which is this distinction between income versus capital gain or capital loss, and what you can carry forward in future years and what you could kind of, if you have a capital loss, but you can put against potential capital gains, or if you're getting an airdrop, see, airdrops, you're saying, are considered income. So basically you want to avoid a scenario which happens all the time where you get airdropped. The moment it happens, you get ten k or whatever, that's taxable event, that's ten k of income, whatever your ordinary income tax is, the rate that you owe. Oh, but now the airdrop's down 80%. Well, your liability never changed. Right. So if you do nothing else in this year, even if you sell your entire position, you actually now don't have enough money to pay for what you owe on the Airdrop.
00:10:57.062 - 00:11:03.954, Speaker A: So what is like a best practice to kind of help people without doing a lot of work? Kind of think about this the right way?
00:11:04.694 - 00:11:55.444, Speaker B: Well, you know, ultimately there's no like, super easy way. The best way is you need to stay, you need to be monitoring your wallets and, you know, you want to have a good Accounting workflow and at least keep your accounting updated on a monthly basis, you know, does everyone do that? No. If not monthly, then Quarterly, you know, as, as frequently as possible. And, you know, if you do know that you're getting a big, a big Airdrop one day, you probably want to go and update your accounting or at least do some sort of back of the envelope calculation and then consider liquidating whatever you expect your tax liability to be out of that into stables or into USD. So that way if it drops, you at least are covering the taxes on that. And then you're not, you're not stuck with you, you know, a tax liability that is increasing by 1050 percent depending on how this asset moves.
00:11:56.784 - 00:12:25.034, Speaker A: Right. And just to kind of clarify here, which I think makes sense what you're suggesting, which is the moment the airdrop happens, put some of it in USDC or whatever stable you like for whatever you think you'll owe on taxes. But then for that we're saying that's ordinary income. So that's just whatever you're like, I guess w two income would be for that year, whatever bracket that falls under, that's what you would theoretically owe, which theoretically shouldn't change that much for any given person in a year.
00:12:25.374 - 00:12:41.702, Speaker B: Yeah. Just versus their capital gain less. Yeah, yeah. And then, and then the capital gain or law. So it's ordinary income and, yeah, that's just going to be based off of your tax rate. You know, it could be anywhere from zero up to 37%. And then, you know, you're going to have the state consideration as well.
00:12:41.702 - 00:12:54.824, Speaker B: Whatever your potential state tax rate is, you're going to need to consider that as well. And then. Yeah, that's going to get taxed as income initially. And then that also sets your cost basis if you do hold the asset, because then you need to be tracking that for capital gains as well.
00:12:55.724 - 00:13:25.142, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Let's talk about another edge case. I see oftentimes based on what cycle you're in, where people are trading tokens and they're swapping from one token to another and every trade they make, they're making gains. Right. Everything's going up. And so what's actually happening, though is there is taxable events on each swap from one token to another. They're going maybe from e to Abe to Solana or whatever, but they're not keeping track of all this.
00:13:25.142 - 00:13:48.114, Speaker A: And so then what happens when the market crashes? Maybe they're actually down completely under position. Maybe it went to zero. But in fact, all those events that happened, they theoretically owe taxes on. How does one avoid this scenario? Because I've seen it happen with friends and just on crypto Twitter. It can be a very financially catastrophic situation.
00:13:48.414 - 00:14:19.964, Speaker B: Absolutely. It can kill a portfolio. And it can put someone in a really bad tax position of even owing the IR's money in some cases. So you definitely want to avoid it. Now, there's really no perfect way, other, again, than like keeping your accounting updated at monthly, quarterly. And look, if you're trading less, if you're, if you're, if you're not as active, then that can become bi yearly or even yearly. But you want to periodically update your accounting and run a basic tax projection to understand what your tax liabilities are.
00:14:19.964 - 00:14:53.994, Speaker B: And then you want to remove that validity risk, meaning you want to then look at your portfolio, see what you want to see what you want to liquidate based off the market to, to make sure you cover that tax liability. Now, if the tax liability is small and you're okay with covering it out of other income sources, then it's no issue. But, you know, if you're planning to pay it out of, out of the crypto gains, really when you make the gains, the best practice would be to liquidate your portion of the taxes into stables or into USD when you incur those gates because that's when the taxable event is and then you're avoiding that validity risk.
00:14:55.894 - 00:15:22.710, Speaker A: Totally. It seems like it's just a great case for staples. Just always be having enough to cover to cover your tax liability. Let's talk about. Before I move to the next topic, I just wanted to also touch on NFTs mints because I think when we were chatting earlier, you mentioned the treatment of them could be slightly different. There might be a sales tax component to them. Like what is a scenario where someone buys an NFT at mint for like one sold and now it's worth 30? Right?
00:15:22.902 - 00:15:23.318, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:23.366 - 00:15:25.594, Speaker A: How should one think about taxes for that?
00:15:26.254 - 00:16:10.632, Speaker B: Well, um, when someone. So to me those are, they're, they're related issues, but I would say like they're, they're two separate issues as well. Usually when we're looking at an NFT, you know, from someone that's buying and selling it as an investor, we're going to be mostly focused on capital gains. And then, you know, there can be this potential at the point of sale in the future that you're going to incur a sales tax or that possibly you should owe a use tax. So we can get into that latter part in a moment. But just for that example that you asked about, you know, if you purchase one at an NFT for one soul and you sell it for 50 soul, that one soul is going to be your initial cost basis. So firstly, you know, if you're minting that with soul, that's a taxable event.
00:16:10.632 - 00:16:52.582, Speaker B: When you sell that soul, and then that one soul is going to then become your cost basis in, in that NFT. And the cost basis is going to be whatever the value of that one soul is at the time of the transaction. Fast forward, you sell it for 50 soul, that's going to be your proceeds. Whatever the time of Solana is at the time of that transaction, you know, the plus and minus of that, that's going to be your capital gain, the value of the 50 Solana versus the value of the one salon in USD. So you have capital gains exposure to that. It's going to depend on your holding period. If it's short term, it's going to basically be at whatever your tax rate is for, you know, basically for ordinary income.
00:16:52.582 - 00:17:44.804, Speaker B: If it's long term, usually it's gonna be a 20% tax rate. But then when you're looking at, you know, industry wide, all these people are selling nfts and anyone that's out minting nfts right now knows that, you know, there's usually not going to be a sales tax that's levied on the sale of their NFT right now. But, you know, this is creating sort of, you know, industry wide, a very large task tax risk for NFT sellers. Cause there's been several states that have indicated that sales taxes are applicable to certain nfts, including some states referencing standalone nfts. The state, that's the best example right now would be Washington state. And most states aren't collecting this. And the problem is is that Washington and other states, they're not creating new regulations or new definitions for nfts.
00:17:44.804 - 00:18:32.226, Speaker B: They're including nfts in existing definitions of digital products and goods, which means there's a retroactive applicability to these taxes, potentially. So, you know, anyone that's sold an NFT in the past as an NFT seller or as a marketplace, you know, has to risk of the state coming and looking for retroactive taxes from sales that even have taken place years ago. Now. You know, what this means for someone that's purchasing nfts, really, is that in the future we're going to see more compliance across the space, I believe. And, you know, there's going to be potentially this additional cost associated with minting nfts. And in many states, you know, when you're filing your tax returns as an individual, you do have to certify that there's no use taxes due. And use taxes are sort of the flip side of sales taxes.
00:18:32.226 - 00:19:10.664, Speaker B: So if you purchase an NFT and they didn't collect sales taxes and they should have, technically you should be paying use taxes. So overall, you know, this is like a huge emerging tax issue and compliance issue. We usually see the enforcement of this from states historically, like, you know, just with sales tax, it's not with nfts, but we usually see it more at the seller and marketplace level. So that's where I believe it'll be focused. But, you know, all these people that right now they may be claiming nfts on, for capital gains purposes, you know, on all their state tax returns right now, and then certifying no use taxes due. So, you know, there can be issues there as well.
00:19:15.444 - 00:19:16.436, Speaker A: Gotcha.
00:19:16.620 - 00:19:16.964, Speaker B: Wow.
00:19:17.004 - 00:19:45.278, Speaker A: Yeah. Another whole other can of worms there. Oh, yeah. So one thing I wanted to get into as well is this idea of like rolling balances, kind of, you have a starting balance, you have an ending balance. You have a lot of stuff that happens in between. We can call taxable events. What is like the, how do people like, actually track this.
00:19:45.278 - 00:20:03.166, Speaker A: What are you seeing work well for clients? Are they using software to help with this? Are they kind of just doing it manually in an Excel sheet? Because I feel like this is probably the most critical part, to your point, staying on top of your accounting for taxes, definitely. Concretely, how does one do this the best way?
00:20:03.350 - 00:21:32.426, Speaker B: Well, you definitely want to use the software now, there are many solutions out there, and there's new ones that are popping up every day, and many of them are capable of serving an individual investor well. But what I will say is that especially if you're airdrop farming or you're just really looking to use more obscure blockchains in general and get out ahead of some of these trends, there's not going to be one platform that's going to be able to just have you have the perfect API integrated for you and keep all your data in one place. What I find is, you know, you want to create a good accounting system and workflow on a software that is going to work for you and maybe at least initially, is serving you well with its, with its blockchain coverage and its capabilities, given like the type of assets that you're transacting on. But then usually, you know, when you go to a new exchange or, you know, a new chain, there may not be a software that just supports that. So then you want to basically go and get an API from another source and you're apt to do CSV imports into that software. So you want to build a good workflow understanding that there's really not going to be one perfect solution and there's going to have to be a lot of data maintenance overall and manual imports. And even if there is blockchain coverage on an exchange, you can't just rely on that API import, especially for nfts or more complex DeFI protocols.
00:21:32.426 - 00:22:13.612, Speaker B: There can be many issues with the price discovery or just how the data comes across and how the taxes are applied to certain protocols. So there's a lot of manual rework and monitoring that needs to be done on that accounting system. And that brings me into a more important point in terms of what I see overlooked a lot industry wide. And this is by people that are using these types of systems just not fully effectively. And this can go for people that, you know, are self calculating, but it can also go for, you know, many firms that are out there. And it's just what I see is like a lack of due diligence in when I'm doing like client intake with new clients. Now, I don't want to like, go through like, every due diligence step on a portfolio because it's probably, like, out of the scope of this video.
00:22:13.612 - 00:23:25.622, Speaker B: But like, one of the big ending ones and an important one that's severely overlooked, is comparing your calculated ending balances to your actual ending balances. What I mean by that is once you do your calculation or your CPA does your calculation, if they're saying you have 100 Solana at the end of the year, you should compare that across your wallets and exchanges and see if you actually have the 100 Solana, if you have 200 Solana, if you have 50 Solana, if you have 95 Solana, there's an issue there that's going to need to be investigated further. And that issue can take many forms, but it's just about then there's some transaction issue that needs to be drilled down on, inappropriately reconcile what a lot of times what I'll see is people come to my firm, maybe, you know, they've done years and years worth of accounting, and they want to now because of complexity or whatever reason, like roll it into our firm. This is the first thing we have to check. And usually it's inaccurate from like, what I've been seeing in most cases. So it's like a huge bottleneck to getting to work with people. And then, you know, what this leads to is inaccuracies in your current year, potentially, and or future years, because there's this cumulative nature to tracking this.
00:23:25.622 - 00:23:58.034, Speaker B: So this is going to just follow you around forever. And, you know, to the many people I know that are out there that probably, you know, haven't done their accounting for years, this is also an issue because the further you put this off, the further we're going to have to go back to get an accurate cost basis calculation. And just outside of the lack of due diligence, there's a lot of issues that can come up with that ending basis, too, like if you choose the wrong accounting method or other considerations. So really, like that check is like an important final check that is just going overload severely.
00:24:00.174 - 00:24:30.694, Speaker A: Absolutely. And it seems like before one, actually, this will be a good way to transition to the next topic here and selecting a CPA to help with this. Should people attempt to do this on their own? Should they do a CPA? What goes into selecting one? And then I guess to this point we just made, how should people prepare for this, knowing that they'll probably ask for a lot of historical data on your front, your accounts where you're landing in real life versus what's been calculated?
00:24:31.114 - 00:25:44.590, Speaker B: Yes. So should people do it themselves or use a CPA? Like, look, if you're just spot buying on Coinbase or another centralized exchange or maybe like one or two of them, and your activity is really light, you probably don't. I mean, if you, if you're, if it's millions of dollars, you may still want to just, just, you know, check the box and just make sure, but I don't think there's enough complexity. That's usually not the type of client we're taking on someone just, you know, spot buying on Coinbase or something. But once you get into, you know, custody and funds across, you know, many different blockchains and, you know, getting involved in complex defi protocols, nfts, you know, whatever the next emerging trend is going to be this cycle, that's going to create all of these data challenges, which then, you know, is going to create accounting challenges, and then due diligence is extremely important. And also when we're dealing with new protocols for your scenarios, you also, it also adds a lot of value when you're just considering the tax positions that you're taking on them. So, you know, what I would say is like, as you start to, you know, if you're just buying and holding major cryptos and buying them on a centralized exchange, you're probably okay.
00:25:44.590 - 00:26:33.190, Speaker B: But if you're more active in this space, across many wallets, many protocols, and, you know, have more of a complex portfolio, it's going to make sense for you to work with the CPA in most cases to ensure accuracy on your accounting and to ensure you're taking the correct tax positions. Because what I'll see is, you know, people can come from years after self managing it, and then they'll realize they made these due diligence issues or they chose the wrong accounting method or this or that. And then, you know, here we are cleaning up four, five plus years of their accounting and possibly amending returns as well. So you want to avoid those issues. And, you know, there's going to be a lot more focus on this space in the future from the IR's. So I think there's a peace of mind component as well. But yeah, you're going to most likely want to work with a CPA in terms of, like, the historical data.
00:26:33.190 - 00:27:27.228, Speaker B: That is one of the bigger challenges when we're taking a new client on and we have to go back, you know, until like, say, like 2016, 2017 timeframe and roll things forward. It's not uncommon that we're going to see data gaps because, you know, you may have been on some obscure, now defunct exchange back in 2017 and purchased some asset that you transferred off there and sold somewhere else. And we're not going to have the data for that. We'll work through those issues. And as you can see, like once you start to get these data issues, that's why this due diligence and like tying your ending positions and stuff become very important to ensure accuracy. But, you know, like, to the degree that you're going to have data gaps on assets that are substantial, it's going to work against you as a taxpayer because you, at the end of the day, when you file something on your taxes, you have to substantiate, substantiated as the taxpayer. So if you're going to claim cost basis, we need to be able to prove it.
00:27:27.228 - 00:28:09.458, Speaker B: And if we don't have exchange records, you know, we can start to look at secondary sources of data. Like maybe you got an email confirmation that you can dig up or something, but we're going to need to put together some type of documentation that can show the date, time and value of the purchase, at least the date and time we can back into the value. But that does become a challenge. But you're going to have to just work through those data gaps and make the necessary adjustments based off of that. But usually if you have significant data gaps, you're going to take a tax hit. Well, for everything, that problem usually is more with smaller centralized exchanges. If you're dealing with larger exchanges, you're going to usually have access to your data or can request it.
00:28:09.458 - 00:29:00.170, Speaker B: Um, and if you're on chain, you know, these are public immutable ledgers. That's why it's not a good idea to not pay your taxes because, you know, these transactions are basically out there in perpetuity. So, you know, when we're just dealing with non custodial wallets, basically all we need is a public wallet address. And you know, we can start to, depending on the blockchain and you know, your, your specific portfolio will go and we'll use with whichever API is depending best to on pull down your data. But to that point, if you find yourself right now going on some smaller exchange to get ahead and purchase some, some micro cap, I would download that transaction data when I'm logging out of the exchange. If it's one you're not using frequently, and even ones that are used frequently, I still recommend downloading it monthly, quarterly. You know, it all sort of depends on your activity, but the data is extremely important.
00:29:00.170 - 00:29:03.614, Speaker B: And you want to make sure that, you know, you're, you're keeping backups on it.
00:29:04.834 - 00:29:15.930, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. I totally understand. A lot of these exchanges years ago don't exist anymore. You can't even log in. And so it could be hard in a world where that happened. Right.
00:29:15.930 - 00:29:49.774, Speaker A: Because their wallets aren't really on chain or they might custody. It requires them to do an export. So it's something that you bring up. What about if someone is realizing now after listening to this interview that maybe I have a lot of complexities this year, I need to hire a CPA. Most likely they need to file an extension. Just given, you know, everyone's really busy like the CPAs are. What does that process look like? How long is the extension? Does it cost anything? What do they, what does the taxpayer do?
00:29:50.474 - 00:30:31.004, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, filing an extension is going to give you more time to file your return. It's not an extension to actually pay your taxes. So, you know, to the degree that you have a tax liability, really, you should have been making estimated taxes on a quarterly basis and your last one should have been done before January 15. So if you're after right now and you have a tax liability, you should expect underpayment penalties at the very least. But what filing an extension will do is it'll extend your time to file the return. So on a personal return, if, you know, if we file an extension by April 15, then you, then you'll have till October 15 to file your tax return.
00:30:31.004 - 00:31:12.962, Speaker B: So if you haven't made an estimated payment, it would be great if you could make an estimated payment. But the problem, if you're trying to walk into a CPA from now and get, you know, everything accounted for in an accurate estimated payment, there's just not going to be enough time. So it's going to like, if you came to our firm right now, you know, you're going to have to make your best estimate possible and then we can file the extension for you on your behalf. And that'll give us, you know, it'll, it'll help you avoid the non filing penalty, which can be much more significant. That can be up to 5%. So, you know, it avoids, it avoids the non filing penalty, but you're still going to get hit with an underpayment penalty if you haven't been updated on your quarterly payments. But then it'll give us till 1015 to file the accounting process itself.
00:31:12.962 - 00:31:58.748, Speaker B: You know, usually we're dealing with either complex portfolios or multi year portfolio calculations. And, you know, that process can take anywhere from one month to three months. So why, like, you know, two weeks is just not going to basically cut it for getting it filed. Doing your portfolio calculation in the proper way with full onboarding, going through the full categorization process, clarifying the nature of all your transactions, going through the reconciliation process, the due diligence process, the review process, there's usually a second round of updates that we have to make. So it is, you know, a step by step process. And it's not, you know, we're not just sort of like plugging this into some software and spitting out a report. We have to really go through the transactions.
00:31:58.748 - 00:32:24.956, Speaker B: And oftentimes there's going to be transactions we have to clarify with you. You know, if you're just having, like your friend send you crypto, we're going to see crypto hit your wallet from some random address. You know, we'll search it in the block explorer. There's no information about it. Like those types of things, we're going to have to reach out to you and clarify and confirm the wallet addresses, the nature of those types of transactions. So the process itself can take time. So, yeah, anyone right now should be filing an extension.
00:32:24.956 - 00:33:00.698, Speaker B: It's going to extend their time to file, not to pay their taxes. And then, you know, they should not, with that extension, not put this off till like September to file. You should file your extension immediately, start on your accounting and get that process accurate. So hopefully you can be filing sometime early summer. And then from there you want to keep these up and, you know, avoid having to do this in future years. That's just keeping your portfolio, portfolio, update it, making quarterly payments. And then usually after clients are embedded with us and working with us after like, the initial cleanup, that subsequent years go much more smoothly because we're in this workflow already.
00:33:00.698 - 00:33:07.494, Speaker B: Everything's updated. You know, we're not cleaning up multiple years or just, you know, getting everything wrangled for the first year.
00:33:12.274 - 00:33:30.274, Speaker A: Right, right. Yeah. And it seems like, I think a lot of people don't realize. Yeah, to your point, when you file the extension, you still owe taxes on whatever activity you had last year. It's just the formal return that's getting an extended deadlight on. Yes.
00:33:30.314 - 00:33:37.210, Speaker B: And what also, what people don't realize, at least even if you pay by 415, you'll still have underpayment penalties because you shouldn't be paying them quarterly.
00:33:37.242 - 00:34:18.564, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That makes complete sense. And then one other question I had actually is along the lines of just another, like, edge case that's, I think, unique to crypto, which is, you know, hacks, phishing, things like this, they happen pretty often. How does one theoretically treat, like the. From a tax perspective, if someone were to be the victim of a hack or a phishing kind of attack on their wallet, maybe they made a gain on their assets, held in the wallet, and then lost it all to a hacker. What. What is, like, the correct way to think about this and treat it?
00:34:18.984 - 00:35:05.174, Speaker B: Well, that is really a difficult case. In many scenarios, you're not really going to get any type of tax deduction. When you do get hacked, of course, you know, each. You want to look at each fact pattern, but the best way that you would be able to deduct that would be as a casualty loss, as an itemized tax deduction, which was basically removed as a tax option as a result of the Tax cuts and Jobs act. So then it becomes much more difficult to look at, you know, ways that you can deduct it. If you're. If something is considered a Ponzi scheme, you may be able to deduct it, but usually, you know, just theft of personal property, like crypto, in, like, just like a.
00:35:05.174 - 00:35:33.164, Speaker B: An example where you're losing it out of your wallet, it's going to be difficult to find an avenue to deduct that with the current way that the taxes are set up. And it's sort of the last sort of kick that someone gets in that scenario oftentimes. But the conservative position that's more likely to not to stand up is that you're not going to be able to take a tax deduction from that.
00:35:35.184 - 00:35:54.592, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Yeah. That's good to know. It's very, very suboptimal for victims of such an attack. One other thing I actually wanted to get in. Yeah, yeah, it sounds like, actually, that's a good point. It sounds like a lot has changed since that tax cut jobs act.
00:35:54.688 - 00:35:55.680, Speaker B: That was a big change.
00:35:55.792 - 00:36:05.174, Speaker A: What are, like some of. Yeah, yeah. What are some of the high levels? Kind of most pertinent things that people probably aren't aware of, you know, as it relates to crypto.
00:36:06.034 - 00:36:31.474, Speaker B: Honestly, there wasn't too much with that. With crypto. I think the casualty loss is maybe one of the bigger things that impacted that. I think the proposed broker regulations that are looking to possibly go in effect in next year, or that's the big substantial changes that we could see with crypto, although it's going to be extremely hard for them to implement.
00:36:33.294 - 00:36:35.034, Speaker A: And what is that at a high level?
00:36:35.574 - 00:37:39.102, Speaker B: At a high level, this sort of goes back to what we were saying about the non custodial nature to crypto and a lot of these transactions and the fact that there isn't any centralized reporting entity, but there's also this tax gap or perceived tax gap related to crypto and tax compliance. You know, if you go on the IR's website right now, they'll claim that there's a 75% non compliance rate, meaning only 25% of people are filing taxes right now. They say that's based off of transaction data they have on taxpayers via, you know, John Doe audits. They have j five agreements where the information share with other countries to get data, you know, from international exchanges and many other methods. So there's this big, big tax gap. So now there's these proposed broker regulations or an attempt to, you know, get a much higher degree of compliance. And basically what they would do is make anyone that's considered a broker have to issue tax reporting and do KYC on just like a centralized exchange would.
00:37:39.102 - 00:38:17.184, Speaker B: The problem is, is that the definition is extremely broad. And I don't have the exact language in front of me, but it's basically anyone that's affecting a transaction will be considered a broker. So, you know, even something like, you know, Uniswap would be considered a broker. So these get implemented. You know, Uniswap would either have to KYC or start geogating, you know, us investors or people that want to use, use their platform. So these are just proposed right now. They're not in effect, but they can be going into effect next year.
00:38:17.184 - 00:38:59.528, Speaker B: And, you know, what you can see is just unprecedented data that gets collected just. And it's really unprecedented, not just for the crypto industry before, just taxpayers in general, there were estimations by the IR's themselves when these first came out like a year or so ago that this will, I forget the exact numbers, but there will be more 1099s that get filed as a result of this because you, can you imagine ever. Basically, everyone will be considered a broker in this case that's in crypto. And, you know, all. All of them will have to file 1099. So it's something like ten Xing or 100 Xing. The total amount of 1099 is to get filed right now in the United States.
00:38:59.528 - 00:39:02.160, Speaker B: This would like, you know, create multiples up.
00:39:02.192 - 00:39:02.804, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:03.384 - 00:39:49.544, Speaker B: So really, like, that's that. This is just the next step for the IR's, basically to just do more data collection. They've been collecting data for crypto transactions for years now. I've been covering this since 2016. And it takes different forms, but this is a new level to where they're going to try to basically get everyone involved to start reporting. And it's going to create even more tax complexity because there's going to be tons of inaccuracies with all the cost basis sharing information. Because can you picture how, how are all these people going to share the cost basis data and get all that accurate and all the duplicated reporting that can take place? So it's going to create, you know, all these new sort of compliance challenges that we're going to have to navigate.
00:39:49.544 - 00:40:11.224, Speaker B: But ultimately, you know, when it, when it came out and still to this day, the industry is, you know, not very happy with it, of course, because of it's going to basically remove the pseudonymity that's associated with these non custodial transactions almost completely. Because you're going to have to just KYC and get all your transaction information sent in.
00:40:12.404 - 00:40:21.252, Speaker A: Right. Right. Yeah. That sounds like administrative nightmare. All that potentially additional paperwork has to go out.
00:40:21.388 - 00:40:21.948, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:40:22.036 - 00:40:57.570, Speaker A: Actually, on that point of just non custodial transactions, I think one of the biggest challenges is just price data because people are now trading meme coins in size and more frequently than ever before, things that aren't trading on Coinbase, centralized exchange, they're just on DeFi, so to speak. How does one think about pricing out all of these different swaps they're doing to make sure that their gain and loss is correct? What are you saying is the most suitable approach here?
00:40:57.722 - 00:41:54.746, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, that is a challenge. And, you know, anyone that's out there that's managing their accounting workflow, you want to do due diligence around that, especially with assets that, you know, have substantial gains or losses. You want to make sure that that pricing data is accurate, that, you know, you're picking up the best source of pricing data, which is going to be the place where you can see the most volume that's taking place, where there's publicly available data. And when we're talking about, you know, the more obscure that a coin gets, the harder it is to find that data and the more limited that it's going to be. But you're going to have to go to the best sources that are available and do so consistently. You know, you can't go and like, pick for a specific asset or just across even a group of assets. You can't go and like, pick a different data source or even like, you know, looking at the average of the closer things like that, you can't go and like cherry pick for different transactions.
00:41:54.746 - 00:42:25.994, Speaker B: You want, you want to follow a consistent approach in sourcing the data to the greatest degree possible. Of course you're probably not going to have to source data for Solana from the same place. You're going to source some brand new obscure meme coin, but you want to have some consistency in, you know, the sources that you check and use and document that and then make sure that it's done consistently. That's like, as a broad sense that that's the advice I think I would give there.
00:42:27.574 - 00:42:34.114, Speaker A: Does one have to be consistent also with like a methodology they choose for lot selection?
00:42:34.454 - 00:43:11.662, Speaker B: That's a really good question because that's actually, I think that is actually going to be a huge issue in the future that I think is going overlooked by a lot of people. Because right now, you know, if you, if usually, like when I'm on an initial call, I'll sometimes I'll ask someone like what maybe they've done, their accounting fears. I'll say what accounting method are you using? Oh, I'm using Hifo. Hypho isn't an acceptable method by the IR's for cryptocurrency. And, you know, people are not aware of that. If you go and log into most of these accounting platforms, you have choices of HIFO, LIFO, average cost. None of those are applicable to crypto.
00:43:11.662 - 00:44:11.394, Speaker B: Now this is sort of a technical explanation of that because specific identification is applicable under certain circumstances. Right. So you have to use FIFO first in, first out, which, you know, if you've been in this space for a while, it's probably going to be less advantageous to you from a tax perspective because, you know, you have low cost basis assets that have been appreciating over time. But FIFO is what's required by the IR's unless you meet the standards for specific identification. Those standards are listed in the Q and A's and it's basically data that most of these softwares are going to be able to provide, you know, date of transaction proceeds, cost basis, audit trail, like all that type of stuff. But the problem is, is you can't go and like plug all of your data into a software and just choose Hifo and have it just make up everything that happened on chain and across exchanges to just optimize your taxes because you're going to then potentially in the future in an audit have to substantiate this. And it's not.
00:44:11.394 - 00:45:27.376, Speaker B: And you know, what you, what you're reporting and the audit show that you have that's supporting that needs to be a true and accurate reflection of how you managed your funds on chain and across exchanges. So if you're taking a fungible cryptocurrency like Solana and maybe purchasing it across a number of exchanges and just, you know, transferring it into different non custodial wallets and just commingling it all together, when you go and you take any one of these Solana, you're not going to be able to choose, like, which one you sent to an exchange and sell. You know, it's not like, it's not like it's a security with a QCIP attached to it where you can apply specific identification. So I see a lot of people that, you know, are choosing HiFO under this guise of specific, specific identification where really, you know, all of their assets are commingled together. They're not really tracking, like, which, you know, they're not specifically identifying which one is being sold, as a matter of fact, you know, they're just representing this data as such. And I believe that's going to be a huge tax issue. So at our firm, you know, our approach is that we use FIFO and, you know, there are, there are certain cases where you can use specific identification, but again, it has to match how you're actually managing your funds.
00:45:27.376 - 00:46:01.844, Speaker B: So if someone maybe comes to me and maybe they purchased bitcoin or Ethereum 510 years back, and then they transferred that to a specific cold wallet, and then, like, fast forward four or five years, they get back into crypto, and now they're just buying and selling on a different exchange. And this one asset has been segregated into a specific cold wallet. And we can track that, that tax basis to that wallet. Then we can specifically identify that asset. But usually, like, people aren't aware of this. They're not managing your assets like that. And then they're going around and they're just, you know, co mingling and transferring these everywhere.
00:46:01.844 - 00:47:05.582, Speaker B: They're not. They're not separating them out by tax law. And then if you go and choose Hifo, you know, with, with the software, and it's not going to actually match what took place, that can become a big audit issue. So this has been something that, you know, I've recognized from, from the beginning getting and have warned against, but I've just seen, like, tons of firms and just tons of people just, you know, blindly choosing Hifo. But recently, like, in the past month or two, I was reading a report from one of the big four tax and accounting firms called Deloitte, which is like, one of the, one of the biggest firms. And this report was from, from their tax resolution team combined with their digital asset team. And they were saying that one of the specific things they're seeing in these audit inquiries which are picking up, by the way, or, or, you know, this, this exact issue, when you claim specific, specific identification, are you in fact managing your funds this way? So I think it's a huge risk because, you know, the IR's is going to look for like the lowest hanging fruit of audits and right now they're focused on non filers.
00:47:05.582 - 00:47:23.364, Speaker B: But the next easiest thing probably is sending out a tax notice or just doing some reverse engineering on the form 8949, seeing what accounting method you're using and auditing that, you know, anyone blindly using HIFO is probably going to be low hanging fruit and they don't even have to really do a full calculation to identify them, you know, so.
00:47:24.864 - 00:47:25.472, Speaker A: Gotcha.
00:47:25.528 - 00:47:36.120, Speaker B: So I guess that's a long way of saying you need to default to FIFo unless you're managing your funds correctly on chain to substantiate specific identification, makes total sense.
00:47:36.152 - 00:47:56.344, Speaker A: And I think that's another one that probably is not well understood by many crypto traders. So appreciate that. So we covered a lot of interesting topics here and we appreciate it. What are some, I guess, final or closing thoughts as we skirt into peak tax season here?
00:47:56.964 - 00:48:27.476, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you know, I would say, you know, don't sleep on your taxes every week. I'm having people come to my firm that haven't filed for several years. And although it's something we can manage, you know, it's always better to stay on top of this. You can even uncover tax benefits to stay on top of it. And the IR's tax enforcement is also going to be picking up. We just recently saw the first indictment from the Justice Department. So I think, you know, just focusing on compliance, not leaving it as an afterthought, not making some of these tax mistakes that we discussed.
00:48:27.476 - 00:48:34.064, Speaker B: That all comes back to just getting your accounting updated and working with a knowledgeable CPA. So that would be my suggestion.
00:48:35.124 - 00:48:52.762, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Well, Patrick, thank you so much for taking the time to talk about this important but probably overlooked topic. And I'll be sure to include your contact info in the show notes for anyone that wants to get in touch with Patrick at Camiso Supa. Awesome, thank you.
00:48:52.938 - 00:48:53.314, Speaker B: Thanks again.
