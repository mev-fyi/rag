00:00:12.680 - 00:00:50.795, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we explore next gen blockchains. We have a bit of a different format today. We're here at Breakpoint and doing some of these interviews in the field. Today I'm joined by Vibhu of Drip, one of the most successful consumer apps in Solana, has been around for a long time and we're going to cover a bunch of topics. This is an interview I've been wanting to do for a long time. Just given Drip's historical significance to Solana, especially back when NFTs are really popular, I would say they're perhaps not as popular these days, but still a very cool product and I think they're cooking up some amazing new things. So Vibu, thanks for joining us.
00:00:50.915 - 00:00:52.255, Speaker B: Nice to finally do this.
00:00:52.635 - 00:00:59.765, Speaker A: For sure. For sure. Well, maybe let's start with this. How would you describe Drip to someone that hasn't heard about it before?
00:01:00.185 - 00:01:28.151, Speaker B: Sure. Drip's like a digital. It's a collectibles platform and you can think about it as a way for creators to build their own kind of Pokemon universe. Except the set of physical cards, you're getting these digital collectibles that you can own. They have all the properties of physical collectibles. You can train them, you can sell them, you can buy them, you can play with them. There's all kinds of things you can do with them.
00:01:28.151 - 00:01:45.355, Speaker B: And what's cool, because they're digital, they also take on new form factors. It's not always the same two by three ratio. You have music, you have videos, you have 3D, you have all kinds of the full expression of what digital media offers.
00:01:46.135 - 00:01:58.481, Speaker A: Is there a particular type of creator that is, I guess resonated with this distribution mechanism? Those. Is it like visual artists? Is it musicians? Is it kind of 3D? You know, graphic designers?
00:01:58.673 - 00:02:18.575, Speaker B: Yeah, Drift pretty diverse, I would say. I mean we kind of came up and through crypto and visual art has a lot of product market fit within crypto already. So that's been a huge wedge for us. But we've really grown significantly in the area of music, for example.
00:02:18.655 - 00:02:19.607, Speaker A: Sure, yeah.
00:02:19.791 - 00:02:41.031, Speaker B: We have plenty of video influencers that people would make that kind of content. We have some really famous comic book creators like Todd McFarlane, the creator spawn we publishes every week on the platform. So it's really, it's. It is. I think what one of the things that creators like about it is that it's not a media type specific experience.
00:02:41.143 - 00:02:42.311, Speaker A: It is media.
00:02:42.423 - 00:02:46.615, Speaker B: If you're creative, you can put whatever you want. In fact, we also have a Lot of podcasts on there. You guys should put your podcast.
00:02:46.655 - 00:02:47.659, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we should. We should.
00:02:47.727 - 00:02:48.587, Speaker B: You waiting for?
00:02:48.731 - 00:03:01.067, Speaker A: Well, here's the thing actually. This is my next question. How does it work? So do you have to onboard as a creator? It's not like is it permissionless where anyone can contribute or is there like kind of a curated set of people that are allowed to create content on Drip?
00:03:01.131 - 00:03:20.325, Speaker B: Yeah, so not intentionally, but right now you have to talk to our team to get onboarded. We don't have onboarding self service, but once you get in actually on the, on September 1st, we sunset our old way of doing drops for creators, which is all by hand.
00:03:20.405 - 00:03:20.621, Speaker A: Sure.
00:03:20.653 - 00:03:38.453, Speaker B: And we introduced Drip Studio and so now all creators can create missionlessly. And so really, really it's. I think it's the best creations product in all of Web3. And yeah, you can, you can. And honestly getting set up takes five minutes. It's just that we don't have the tool yet to do it.
00:03:38.589 - 00:03:41.821, Speaker A: Sure, yeah, automatically, but I'm sure that'll come in the future as well.
00:03:41.893 - 00:03:46.837, Speaker B: Our goal is, I don't think we said this publicly, but our goal is to get to full self service by.
00:03:46.861 - 00:04:09.465, Speaker A: End of the year. Oh, nice. Yeah, it's coming up soon then. And maybe help me understand like from a storytelling standpoint, are there examples of creators that perhaps got a ton of new revenue or earnings potential because they specifically use Drip? Like how do you sell this product to someone that maybe isn't in crypto but is, you know, producing art of some form?
00:04:10.485 - 00:04:57.155, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Drip is really a way to show off your talents. And so we, a lot of our, even collectors become creators in the platform as I think there's more than just money. I do think like relative to web2, drip has very healthy earning potential creators, our median creator makes more than for example, like a median OnlyFans creator, a lot more than the media and Patreon creator. So compared to Web2 tools, we're doing very well. We've had some big success stories. Everyone knows degenpoet in Solana, slot based artists, but you know, even Todd McFarland who came from outside this plant, creators are making thousands of dollars a month. Some have made, you know, 10,000, 100,000 buffs on the platform.
00:04:57.155 - 00:05:42.673, Speaker B: It's, it really is. Drip is really, it can scale to wherever the creator is with their fan base and it's a very powerful tool to monetize an audience. But more importantly, I think that when you join Drip as a creator, you're joining a community of other like minded creative entrepreneurs and you really level up your game through the tools and you find, yeah, you find fans, you find peers. There's so much collaboration on the platform. I really think that we want to be kind of like the spiritual successor to something maybe like deviantart from one two.
00:05:42.809 - 00:05:44.057, Speaker A: I'm actually not super familiar with that.
00:05:44.081 - 00:05:52.857, Speaker B: One, but just a home for people who are creatives and who want to, especially in digital media.
00:05:53.001 - 00:05:57.425, Speaker A: Is it analogy to Patreon app in this or is it a little bit different there?
00:05:57.505 - 00:06:33.685, Speaker B: Yeah, we share some similarities in the sense that we're kind of in the broad category of direct monetization. In Web2Social, you have indirect monetization, you build an audience, but if you want to make money, you have to take them off the platform, go buy merch, go buy my tickets, this or that. Patreon may be the most well known direct monetization platform and we're in the category. But relative to them, I think Drip, there's a much more comprehensive set of tools.
00:06:33.765 - 00:06:34.005, Speaker A: Sure.
00:06:34.045 - 00:07:00.397, Speaker B: We really drive discovery for creators. That's not something that most fan platforms do. And the reason that we can do that is that Drip is built on a blockchain and therefore the way our payments work is much different than traditional. Like on every other platform in Web two, in our category, you have this kind of artificially high price point.
00:07:00.461 - 00:07:01.265, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah.
00:07:01.815 - 00:07:17.887, Speaker B: Where you have to pay $2, $5, $10 a month to get a single creator's content. And for most consumers, to be honest with you, even spending like 12 bucks a month on Netflix to give you unlimited content is a big. It's a big deal.
00:07:17.951 - 00:07:18.223, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:18.279 - 00:07:26.671, Speaker B: And to do that for one creator is hard on Drip. You can subscribe to like 100 or 200 creators for like a dollar or two dollars.
00:07:26.743 - 00:07:27.321, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:27.463 - 00:07:36.509, Speaker B: So that, you know, so our users like, are much more likely to go out and search for, you know, a whole bunch of creators that they can patronize and get content from.
00:07:36.677 - 00:07:51.917, Speaker A: So yeah, broadening access just because the cost access is a lot lower. How exactly do creators make money through Drip? Is it through tips? Is it through direct subscriptions? Is there like a set of parameters that they could set there? Or royalties even? Is that a thing?
00:07:51.981 - 00:08:12.645, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, all of the above. So pretty much everything that a collector or fan does with a creator is a micro transaction, including, like when you like a piece of cost on the platform, it's actually a 1/10 of a cent donation to the creator, which is pretty cool.
00:08:12.725 - 00:08:13.245, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:08:13.325 - 00:08:31.203, Speaker B: But it feels seamless. Unlike some of the Other like crypto products that do wallet connects. Every time you're trying to do commerce you have this thing called droplets. It's a, it starts as an off chain kind of like in game currency.
00:08:31.299 - 00:08:31.595, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:31.635 - 00:08:51.129, Speaker B: But for creators it gets converted to USDC on solana automatically every 24 hours. So as collectors are securing your drops on the blockchain, liking your content, participating in the leaderboard or even trading on secondary, all those are my vision can be for the greater.
00:08:51.217 - 00:09:27.655, Speaker A: Gotcha. Yeah, sweet. I think it's been a really powerful story to watch I think you know, because oftentimes in crypto you see creators or celebs just jump in and maybe they'll try to launch a meme coin or something and you know, it doesn't always work out for the fans. But with something like drift, I feel like you can create this sort of mutually beneficial relationship. Now one thing I will say is in today's day and age in crypto, you know, NFT trading volume is down. A lot, a lot of people are saying NFTs are dead. You know and I think you guys even tongue in cheek have said, you know, is drip dead? And did a couple of events with that headline.
00:09:27.655 - 00:09:33.515, Speaker A: So maybe let's talk about the FUD a bit. What do you think about NFTs today? What's happening? What's the problem?
00:09:34.575 - 00:09:44.551, Speaker B: Well, I think in within crypto when you say the word, the term nft you think pfp.
00:09:44.663 - 00:09:45.295, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:45.415 - 00:10:01.679, Speaker B: And so when people say our NFT is dead, they're actually saying are this one particular class of these 10k collections dead? In my opinion, I, I've never, I know even when they were on the off site I never really understood.
00:10:01.807 - 00:10:02.247, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:02.311 - 00:10:05.543, Speaker B: How it's going scale. You can't build a business with only 10,000 customers.
00:10:05.639 - 00:10:06.213, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:06.359 - 00:11:04.369, Speaker B: And royalties have never been a strong enough and royalties really to me it doesn't make sense in the business model because it's predicated on your customers selling your assets that apparently are the entry point to some amazing thing that you made. So I'm pretty bearish on that idea. Obviously there's been some surprising lasting power things like you know, Kudzi Penguins and Ad Labs. But the thing that's the thing is that in my opinion the very top of the NFT world, they're all venture backed companies. So they have like real financial like economic power to sustain the price of the collections. But even if they didn't do NFTs, people would still be excited about them. I think the NFTs are kind of like okay, we did that and you know, you can't really roll it back.
00:11:04.369 - 00:11:10.929, Speaker B: But I think if those, if they were going to market today, they probably wouldn't, they probably wouldn't start with like 10 pay collection, you know.
00:11:10.977 - 00:11:11.945, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:11:12.105 - 00:11:29.151, Speaker B: And Luca made a good point yesterday on stage about, you know, derivative collections and how those actually enhance the value prop of the first ones. But I think he's making the point that like scarcity doesn't really. Scarcity as the determining factor of value is a meme.
00:11:29.183 - 00:11:29.551, Speaker A: It doesn't.
00:11:29.583 - 00:12:22.985, Speaker B: It no longer really makes sense. But non fungible tokens is just, it's just a type of tokens. Yes, it's indivisible token. And I think that structure, that technology is, which powers Drip still still has like a very important place I think in the future, you know, and you see that, you know, with tokenized music and tokenized content in general, art, et cetera, that's, you know, this, what's happening on that side is fundamentally new. Like there's no, there's nothing like that. You can, there's no other way to sell a digital object that has the properties that NFCs do in Web2. So like my opinion, we're gonna start to see.
00:12:22.985 - 00:12:28.293, Speaker B: We've been. We don't talk about NFTs. We don't use that word ever.
00:12:28.349 - 00:12:29.005, Speaker A: Oh, okay. Yeah.
00:12:29.045 - 00:12:31.213, Speaker B: Any of our marketing. We always talk about collectibles.
00:12:31.269 - 00:12:31.945, Speaker A: Yep.
00:12:32.525 - 00:12:43.823, Speaker B: And I think that's, I think that's probably where things are headed. There's gonna be lots of things that use NFTs underneath, but I think anyone that's building on top of them is not gonna want to use chm.
00:12:43.909 - 00:12:44.131, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:44.163 - 00:12:47.875, Speaker B: Because it's been really muddy by vapes.
00:12:47.995 - 00:13:08.875, Speaker A: Yeah. It's been tainted by what's happened with the crash of 10k pfps. So drip's been around for a while. I'm sure you guys have had a lot of learnings and are now kind of focusing on a new set of potential features and product improvements. Walk us through what's next for Drip. Yeah. Cool.
00:13:09.035 - 00:13:16.875, Speaker B: So we're about to announced today that we're opening a beta to a native iOS and Android app for everybody.
00:13:16.955 - 00:13:17.735, Speaker A: Very nice.
00:13:18.435 - 00:13:24.895, Speaker B: I'll set, I'll show the camera real quick. So this is the Drip Drip beta.
00:13:25.235 - 00:13:25.975, Speaker A: And.
00:13:28.115 - 00:14:09.423, Speaker B: It'S a fully featured app and it's completely. Yeah, you don't experience the blockchain at all in it. Everything you do, like this is me collecting an nft, but there's no wallet dialogue. I just got this as an NFT on chain in like two seconds. That is, that is something that we've been really working on for, you know, this kind of experience for the last two years. To make using Solana, sending transactions to creators, collecting feel like something that you like, feel like a Web2 product, essentially.
00:14:09.519 - 00:14:10.235, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:10.815 - 00:14:33.463, Speaker B: So mobile is a big focus for us. We also, you know, post Craig Point, we're going to be rolling out a bunch of social features. We're trying to bring some of the, like, community elements that happen on Twitter today around Drip and more deeply integrating to the products. And yeah, lots of other. I mean, we have a. Yeah, we're.
00:14:33.479 - 00:14:44.225, Speaker A: Always cooking, but sure, yeah, yeah, that's super cool experience. Does that involve, like, do you guys have an embedded wallet? Are you sponsoring gas? How are you making this invisible crypto design pattern work?
00:14:44.265 - 00:15:23.355, Speaker B: Yeah, Drip has always been gasless, even from the very first drop that we did and never asked someone to pay us to that. And it's all. Everything in Drip is a airdrop mechanic behind the scenes, so. Or an off chain, the on chain interaction. But we handle the on chain on our own end. So for NFTs or collectibles as we call them, you secure in the back end, we mince, we transfer, we kind of handle all that for payments. Similar, you send, we convert, transfer, usdc.
00:15:23.355 - 00:15:34.167, Speaker B: This model, I think, is quite powerful. I think a lot of companies are going to end up using it because it allows you to basically, like, the user never feels any friction at all.
00:15:34.231 - 00:15:40.119, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really powerful. Super excited to try this out. So you said it's going to be out pretty soon. You're announcing it today?
00:15:40.167 - 00:15:43.071, Speaker B: Yeah, we're announcing about an hour.
00:15:43.143 - 00:16:01.365, Speaker A: Yeah. Nice, nice. So we got the early access there. Amazing. And where do you see like five years from now, Drip from a product standpoint, from like an adoption standpoint, how do you see this kind of playing out over time?
00:16:02.385 - 00:16:09.457, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's very hard to predict the future. I've been trying to do it my entire life.
00:16:09.521 - 00:16:09.961, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:16:09.993 - 00:16:52.385, Speaker B: As an entrepreneur. But, you know, I think, I mean, I can just speak about the next year, really. We are. We've been growing. I think one of the defining features of Drift that people know us for is we're one of the few things that's acquiring a lot of Net new users, even here at Breakpoint. I had multiple people come to me and told me that Drip was their entry point into crypto and now they're here at Breakpoint to explore other things that are happening in the ecosystem. So I think really everything we do is trying to simplify the product experience, improve the core value prop.
00:16:52.385 - 00:16:58.557, Speaker B: We're not really, like, innovators in terms of, like, smart contracts or like, on chain mechanics.
00:16:58.621 - 00:16:59.421, Speaker A: Sure, yeah.
00:16:59.573 - 00:17:30.127, Speaker B: The heart of Drip is really product and user experience and, like, you know, creating these kind of breakthrough use cases for it. So, yeah, within the next year or two, the app is going to feel completely different, seem much more friendly to people coming from outside. And we continue to have extremely strong traction, especially with creators from all over the world. Not just crypto, but we have many, many creators owning the web too.
00:17:30.231 - 00:17:30.995, Speaker A: Yep.
00:17:31.735 - 00:18:01.439, Speaker B: That's been. Yeah. Lived over the last year. The biggest change for us has been moving from like, just the Solana creators to finding creators from other chains to finding creators from Web2. Everyone on that side really, really loves Drip. That makes me feel like, you know, if we, you know, hopefully they can tell their Web2 audience about us. That's a real, like, place where I think Solana as a chain is going to experience a lot of growth.
00:18:01.607 - 00:18:35.595, Speaker A: Makes sense. I think one question I have from a product standpoint is, you know, assume everything goes well. We have millions of creators and hundreds of millions of users. How do you think about discovery? Right. Like, this is a big sticking point with creators on YouTube or TikTok or what have you is you're almost. You need an algorithm to help people find stuff that you think resonates with them. And so in the best case scenario, if you have all these people on both sides of the marketplace here, like, how do you think about marrying kind of users with content that you think would resonate with them?
00:18:36.215 - 00:19:04.551, Speaker B: So I actually think this is like a pretty solid problem in Web2, and it's been solved in a number of different ways. What creators don't like about the algorithms and Instagram and whatnot is that they kind of. It's very consumptive. So you're. You load up a feed. I'm not sure if that's even a word, but you load up a feed and even though you follow creators or inserting other things into that that you didn't ask for.
00:19:04.623 - 00:19:05.235, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:06.715 - 00:19:24.035, Speaker B: And as a creator on those platforms, you feel like you have to create a certain type of thing in order for it to succeed. So you see, like, a lot of artists, for example, talk about how, like, nothing I post is getting any visibility to the audience that I myself build.
00:19:24.115 - 00:19:24.611, Speaker A: Right, Right.
00:19:24.643 - 00:19:52.585, Speaker B: Unless I'm dancing to the latest music trend. Right, yeah. So we think about discovery a little differently. Like, first of all, we always protect the relationship between the creator and the fan. And we're like, it's, it's like structurally beneficial to us to do that. We want fans to make these direct contributions to the creators that they love. And so, and I think this is the power of the blockchain.
00:19:52.585 - 00:20:25.605, Speaker B: When the creator sends something to you, it's. They're actually sending it to you. It's not of being intermediate by, you know what we want the first, the end of your receipt. But on the creator discovery side, a lot of those algorithms are actually pretty useful if you're trying to discover folks that you've never seen before. We're going to have a Tinder like experience with. You already have that experience for the collectibles that have been sent to you. But we're going to bring that because we were creator discovery.
00:20:25.605 - 00:20:46.937, Speaker B: We're going to have FYP mechanic, a Fury page mechanic on our auctions and if you have a search page in our field of discovery for us. So we do think we can learn from what you like and then show you new things. But we don't have a plan to intercede in the relationship that the creators already built.
00:20:47.001 - 00:20:48.857, Speaker A: Yeah, they always have access to their audience.
00:20:48.961 - 00:20:52.417, Speaker B: That's a really important distinction. It really is based on business policy.
00:20:52.521 - 00:20:52.761, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:52.793 - 00:21:08.611, Speaker B: It really comes down to that. Like, the reason that's how Instagram works is because they're trying to, to shove ads into your. Into the same kind of mechanic. Right. Drift isn't really ad supported. It's, it, it's, it's just not. And I think that leads us to build a product development.
00:21:08.763 - 00:21:19.251, Speaker A: Right. So like Instagram, YouTube, they're optimizing for ads because that's how they make money. But then how do you guys, how does Drip make money? How do you guys, like, ensure your economic interests aren't at odds with that of the artist?
00:21:19.403 - 00:21:51.975, Speaker B: Yeah, we're completely aligned economically. So when users want to donate, they buy droplets. Drip takes a margin of those droplets on every sale. We contribute the rest of the margin back to creators. That's how they get paid. We also run sponsorships, so we work with every week. This year we've had a sponsor on Drip, and that's from companies like Star Atlas to Lulo to Wanderers and many crypto games.
00:21:51.975 - 00:21:58.803, Speaker B: And we take a percentage of that revenue and then we also take the percentage of it and give it back to traders as well.
00:21:58.859 - 00:21:59.535, Speaker A: Okay.
00:21:59.955 - 00:22:05.259, Speaker B: Drip also has a 1 1/2% royalty on all collectibles that have ever been distributed to the platform.
00:22:05.347 - 00:22:05.987, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:06.131 - 00:22:11.935, Speaker B: And that's. We send out almost 180 million NFTs on Solana.
00:22:12.475 - 00:22:13.155, Speaker A: Good number.
00:22:13.235 - 00:22:18.491, Speaker B: Yeah, we're. I think we are something like 40% of all the NFT ever created on.
00:22:18.523 - 00:22:31.775, Speaker A: The board of teams php. That's a. It's a great metric. Yeah. Nice, nice. Also, I think we covered a lot of awesome topics. Is there any closing thoughts here? Anything else you can tease or for us users to look forward to besides the mobile app?
00:22:32.875 - 00:22:50.189, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say you have a slot of native audience. Right. If you've tried Drip in the past, I want you to know that like we update the product every single week like we are, to the point where people complain. Why are always changing stuff?
00:22:50.237 - 00:22:51.109, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:51.237 - 00:23:22.099, Speaker B: But we're literally always tinkering with the experience and improving it and making it better. So if you sign up for Drip a long time ago and you haven't revisited and you kind of understand the premise, I really think you'll enjoy the product. I don't think it's anything like it was two years ago or even a year ago. Yeah, it's. And even if you're interested in just like the future of crypto products, I think the experience we built is just next level. There's a lot in long term as well. So.
00:23:22.099 - 00:23:24.323, Speaker B: Yeah, please give it a try. I'd love to know what you think.
00:23:24.419 - 00:23:24.811, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:23:24.843 - 00:23:25.459, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:23:25.587 - 00:23:32.387, Speaker A: Webby, thank you for taking time out of your busy day here at Breakpoint to chat about Drip. Looking forward to trying the new app and the new products.
00:23:32.491 - 00:23:33.035, Speaker B: Thanks, SaaS.
