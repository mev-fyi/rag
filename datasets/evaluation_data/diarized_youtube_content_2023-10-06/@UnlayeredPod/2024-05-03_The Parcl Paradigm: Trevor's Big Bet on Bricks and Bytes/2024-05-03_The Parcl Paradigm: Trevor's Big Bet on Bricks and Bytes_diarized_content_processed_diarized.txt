00:00:15.760 - 00:00:48.482, Speaker A: So today we're talking about parcel, a synthetic asset protocol focused specifically on real estate. And from what I understand, it's by cities in the US. Um, now, there's been a lot of crypto protocols that have tried to make real estate more liquid and accessible. Some of them take individual buildings and turn them into nfts, or basically fractionalize them into nfts. But. But this is a bit of a different bet. I mean, what's been your take on kind of the intersection of crypto and real estate so far? Dave?
00:00:48.578 - 00:01:37.544, Speaker B: There's always this grand promise that real estate, it's like one of the biggest assets in the world, huge ability to unlock a huge amount of volume into crypto. But as you say, the problem is if you're just bringing on individual homes, individual assets onto the blockchain, they're not fungible. And then you've also got these issues around property rights, about how do you enforce it. If there's a property that split up between 100 people and you lose your key, who's going to enforce the right that you did actually own that, but you've lost your nft to it? I think there's lots of issues around bringing real estate onto the blockchain, and I think this could be a really interesting way of going about it by actually having synthetic derivatives effectively on the per square foot price of real estate.
00:01:38.324 - 00:02:23.064, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. One thing I do for fun oftentimes is just read about what cities are really interesting, or growing really fast in the US, or even on the other hand, which cities have declined a lot. You know, without crypto, it's really hard to take an actual view on that because you would have to literally buy a house in those cities, or sell a house or go short a house, which is not even possible in other cities that you think are going down. And so theoretically, protocols like parcel that create these synthetic instruments to emulate real estate prices, it seems like pretty promising and interesting, and I think it just makes a ton of sense. And so, yeah, super exciting to just dive into this a bit more with the founder and figure out what the story is behind Parcel.
00:02:23.524 - 00:02:54.604, Speaker B: I think one thing that's actually interesting about it is that the normal person can have quite a good edge when it comes to localized real estate markets. Because you can be living in a specific area of New York. You're going to know better than the person who sat in San Francisco and is looking at it on a national scale. So I think it's an interesting product. Everyone has a feel, really, for the direction of real estate property prices in their cities and yeah, I think it could be successful, but it'll be an interesting chat for sure.
00:02:55.824 - 00:03:30.184, Speaker A: Definitely, definitely. Yeah. The alpha you generate just by walking around your neighborhood could be put to use. Welcome to Unlayered, the podcast where we explore next generation blockchains. I'm your host, Saul, alongside my co host here, Dave. And today we're joined by Trevor of Parcel, founder and CEO of Parcel. Trevor, how's it going? Excited to have you today and talking about real estate and Defi.
00:03:31.004 - 00:03:34.944, Speaker C: Great. It's going well. Thank you for having me. Great to be here.
00:03:35.404 - 00:04:08.344, Speaker A: For sure, for sure. Parcel has been one of the cool projects I've followed at a distance throughout the last year and a half or so, but haven't really had a chance to think super hard about that whole space. I think when it comes to how crypto can improve finance and Defi, real estate is a super exciting area and it's something that a lot of people have mentioned before. And it feels to me like Parcel is really ahead of the curve here and has actually deployed some pretty cool products on that front that are super interesting to watch.
00:04:09.124 - 00:04:23.144, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's been a journey, quite a ride. We've been at it for a couple of years. We have a great team and we're putting out products pretty fast, so the team is innovating and executing well.
00:04:23.444 - 00:04:41.028, Speaker A: For sure. For sure. Well, tell us a bit about that, how you found this specific niche being interesting to explore within crypto. As I understand, you had a background in Wall street, obviously covering a lot of different asset classes. What made you feel like this was kind of where you wanted to focus on?
00:04:41.196 - 00:05:27.364, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the best place to start is my background was in investing in technology equity. So I was a portfolio manager at a couple hedge funds in New York, and it covered software, payments, Internet. So I've been familiar with blockchain pretty intimately since 2017. So ive been following it. And during COVID there was a lot of real estate volatility. And one of our co founders, Kellen, we worked together and we were trying to figure out a way in which we could get exposure to real estate without actually owning the underlying asset. We had seen a lot of fractionalized or tokenized companies or products.
00:05:27.364 - 00:06:27.574, Speaker C: It was our view that those are tough to scale because you need the capital to acquire the offering effectively. They're offering slices or tokens of the underlying equity. So in order to do that, you need to acquire property, and so you need money and then you need time. So those two scarce resources are kind of operating as a headwind. What we wanted to do was effectively create an index that tracks the underlying pricing dynamics of real estate markets. So in our view, the most lively elements of that are sales and listings, because they are the actual price points offered to the public. What we came to realize was that there were no price indexes that tracked the price per square foot or price per square meter, if you're denominated in that term.
00:06:27.574 - 00:07:15.600, Speaker C: So we had to create that first. We had to create price feeds that track the price per square foot based on sales and listings. We do that via our data effort called Parcel Labs. Parcel Labs is a wholly owned subsidiary and every day publishes a price point for the tradable cities on the the platform. We decided to go at this time, that was like late 2020, early 2021. DeFi was showing a lot of promises as a way to distribute it, like form capital in a distributed manner. And I had been familiar with it, and it's just a very efficient technology to create an underlying issue.
00:07:15.600 - 00:07:41.986, Speaker C: John, that's kind of how we, that's like the genesis. I think most of that still holds true. Blockchain is super efficient. We're on Solana, so transaction fees are really low, fast, and scalable. So that's effectively why we decided to build on blockchain. It was the quickest time to market. It's a novel product.
00:07:41.986 - 00:07:51.842, Speaker C: There's really not that. There's really not anything like it, or there wasn't. And so speed, to us was the way to go.
00:07:52.018 - 00:08:16.734, Speaker B: I think it'd be good just to maybe list out more clearly what the other options currently are if you want to gain exposure to the real estate market. So obviously the first one would be buying your own house, which, as you say, is definitely capitally intensive. But I mean, John, just go through the other ones. But I think reits is the obvious parallel, maybe in tradfi, but yeah, let you take it away.
00:08:17.314 - 00:09:01.684, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So you could buy a house in the more like alternative or newer generation. There's a lot of companies who have tried to offer fractional ownership of houses or buildings. Reits are a common analogy. The reits are different mainly in the sense that theyre types of assets versus location based. So the largest reits are data centers, distribution centers, retirement homes, and those can be dispersed across the entire country or the globe. So its more of a less about the actual underlying market and more about the type of asset that the REIT holds.
00:09:01.684 - 00:09:28.074, Speaker C: And so that would be what you're gaining exposure to if you're interested or want to get exposure to data, Amazon data center bills or shopify distribution expansion, you could get exposure to that through a REIT. It's a second derivative, but the underlying real estate is less of a factor in that investment.
00:09:28.214 - 00:09:47.974, Speaker A: And tell us about, I guess, the use case from a product standpoint, is it more for people to take a view on? Hey, I think Las Vegas, for instance, is going to outperform other cities in terms of real estate prices. So let me make a position here and maybe ill add some leverage to it. How do you see that user journey working for people using parcel?
00:09:48.594 - 00:10:21.400, Speaker C: Yeah, thats a great question. So yeah, its kind of like in the eye of the older. So theres a lot of, to us, to the development team at Parcel, this is something that we believe should exist in the world, a way to get exposure on or against real estate, like a real estate spot market today. Obviously the example you said is the vanilla use case. So someone wants to get exposure, they can do that now through parcel. If it goes up, you make money. If it goes down, you lose.
00:10:21.400 - 00:11:18.776, Speaker C: You could go short and if it goes down, you win. There's the structural tailwind, I guess, for us, but headwind for most people, which is unaffordability and housing. So if you're a forever renter, you can actually get exposure to the market that you're living in, that you may, maybe you're saving up to buy a home or an apartment with 8% interest rates and the economy, maybe now is not the right time so you can still get exposure to that. Institutional buyers, they could hedge their longs because there is no way to short real estate, really, just like any other asset class. So you could own the physical and short the derivative. So to parcel, it's really the option. There's many permutations as to who could use it.
00:11:18.776 - 00:11:26.104, Speaker C: To us, this should exist and we put it in the world and we're starting to see the different use cases amongst our user Personas.
00:11:26.264 - 00:12:05.364, Speaker B: I think the hedging point is a really, really interesting one. I'm just curious about. You said that you can't short risd. It does seem strange that no one has come up with this concept in trad five before. Was it like a taboo topic really, to want to short residential real estate? Because in the film with Michael Burry, the big short, there's sort of a negative air around the fact that he does manage to find some sort of way to short the market. So do you think it's more a case of. It's been like a taboo subject to even offer a product which could short the market.
00:12:05.364 - 00:12:14.524, Speaker B: Or do you think it wasn't technically feasible before or. Yeah. What do you put that down to? Because it does seem like a natural financial instrument to include in a healthy market.
00:12:15.664 - 00:12:16.232, Speaker A: Trey?
00:12:16.328 - 00:12:48.568, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know. Especially the way that the housing system is such a big part of the us economy, for sure. And the us personal journey. You're told that you own a house and part of the dream, and then betting against that would be kind of un american maybe or something. This is speaking from an american standpoint. And then obviously there's a whole ecosystem around, housing, realtors, banks.
00:12:48.568 - 00:13:26.552, Speaker C: So that could be it. There could be a portion of it. I think, though, what we've seen through the data is home prices, even though it may not be huge swings, they move daily. I think that's like the first thing to kind of understand. And then parcellabs, the data shows that. And then, yeah, every other asset class you can short pretty much in the world, you can short rate, you can short stocks, you can short oil, any commodity. Right.
00:13:26.552 - 00:13:50.122, Speaker C: So maybe because the. The consumer is so, and everyone who owns a home is like a mom and pop, you're betting against Main street to some extent, but regardless, it's a neutral venue, so it's not meant to. You should have the option to express your view. And that's really what we're trying to.
00:13:50.138 - 00:14:35.324, Speaker A: Offer in terms of, I guess, future product offerings from what I understand of parcel. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like it's pretty easy to take a thematic view on either an entire city or entire country. Whereas in the old school way of doing things, the only way to get exposure to real estate is to literally buy the building itself or maybe through a reit like some collection of buildings or things like that. But it's almost like this middle ground of maybe taking a more concentrated bet, for instance, a neighborhood or a specific borough of New York City. That's a bit harder to do. Do you feel like there's interest on that front to kind of take more concentrated bets and in real estate plays, aside from going kind of citywide, how do you view that?
00:14:36.784 - 00:15:32.206, Speaker C: Yeah, so that was the original. The original idea, you know, longer law in Brooklyn and short Tribeca or something like that, you know, I think, yes, that in the future that's something we want to be able to offer. We, you know, to start just given that it's a novel product and neighborhoods are more intimate, you know, you have some neighborhoods that are widely known, like Soho. Yeah, but, you know, maybe Soho and London, too, or Venice beach. But, you know, I think to start, we wanted to really find some recognizable cities, get people familiar with the product, and then from there we can layer, layer down. We can get to the neighborhood level below that. Like the block level is harder because you just have sparsity of transactions.
00:15:32.206 - 00:16:34.204, Speaker C: So the pricing is less free flowing, the neighborhood level is fine. So in time, we just need to get momentum and have people understand and figure out how to roll out new neighborhoods, for example, and educate people on the differences of each. Because if you think about each market being like a product, obviously theres the product on both fronts. Theres the data, theres the actual trading platform, and then each market itself is the actual instrument. The lower you go, the more nuances there are. So were started quasi high from the city level and something that at least people are somewhat familiar with, especially in regards to the case Shiller, which is the house index that people commonly reference. So parcel effectively has all those markets just so that you have a clear correlation to something that already exists.
00:16:39.164 - 00:17:02.172, Speaker B: So obviously the data collection is going to be hugely important, especially because I assume this is going to be something which is going to happen completely off chain. And then you use an oracle to bring it on chain, something like that. So, yeah, John, just talk through how you're going about sort of ensuring, I suppose, accuracy of the data, but also ensuring there's no meddling with the data. There's no funny business going on.
00:17:02.348 - 00:17:24.074, Speaker C: Yeah. So, you know, the accuracy, there's third party benchmarks that. So the one that we typically relate the data to the most is the case Shiller. Even though we know there's a bunch of problems with the case Shiller. It just is what it is. And it's normalized. There's no actual price.
00:17:24.074 - 00:18:07.072, Speaker C: It's indexed, so there's no price per square foot. The parcel labs has actual price per square foot, which we think is just a better relative metric and verifiable. And so regardless, every month we publish case Shiller predictions. The correlations with the parcel labs data is 0.99. So it's right there. I think initially it's all about establishing trust. We're working on partnerships with major media outlets, and then over time you'll have third parties helping to verify and diagnose how accurate we are.
00:18:07.072 - 00:19:08.440, Speaker C: There's some other home price indexes that update on a different cadence. We thought it was important to be daily, most update monthly, but a lot can happen a month, especially as capital moves more quickly, technology helps accelerate home purchases, ibuyers, et cetera. So, yeah, I think that that's how thus far we've established trust and representativeness in the future. From a technology standpoint, there is potential that the most obvious, but it's still not quite ready for prime time. From a cryptographical perspective, is zero knowledge oracles. So basically this price going in is using this methodology, and you validate that through zero knowledge, proof goes through the oracle and it becomes more trustless. So that's over time where we want to go.
00:19:08.440 - 00:19:14.564, Speaker C: It's just that technology is pretty early and we haven't found one. That's quite right.
00:19:14.944 - 00:19:37.674, Speaker A: One of the points you alluded to earlier is, I guess, the importance of having liquid markets for these types of instruments. How has your experience been so far, being on Solana, which has had a bit of a lull in terms of all of its DeFi protocols, that I think the guard is changing soon and we're seeing more interest. But certainly being tethered to that ecosystem presents its own unique set of challenges there.
00:19:38.894 - 00:20:36.494, Speaker C: Yeah, so just a little bit of the backstory. We chose Solana probably a little over two years ago, probably the summer of 21, and the reason being it was fast, cheap and scalable. And that was something that we cared about mostly on the cost side, because we didn't want more marginal costs for the user and more friction, especially in real estate, where expected returns could be lower given the volatility in the asset itself. So fees were something we were really focused on. I think that thesis largely is true still. It's still fast, cheap, scalable. There's been a few outages, but the team that's Alana team is working on redundancy in their new instance of it's called fire dancer, and that'll create another, basically another codebase in a different programming language.
00:20:36.494 - 00:21:32.154, Speaker C: So you reduce the risk of a bug in both, so it would just fail over to the other instance. So I think from that perspective, it's fine. I do think FTX and everything associated with FDX blew a hole in a lot of the ecosystem, both from a funding perspective. And then I think they did a lot of volume on most every protocol that at least they invested in throughout themselves and elevator. So, you know, I think kind of we're here, we're making the best of it. I think the technology that the team is putting out is still really good, and they're making a lot of progress. And with that, over time, I think it should be able to rebound for us.
00:21:32.154 - 00:22:22.418, Speaker C: It's really a date to the people that are the users that we've encountered. I think if going back in time, we were to say we started on arbitrum. I think your floor is higher from an initial liquidity perspective. I dont know how that grows over time. And the reason why I say that is not because of arbitrum, but its to say that the folks that weve talked to, its less about. For the crypto native people, the chain matters. But outside of that, for institutions, you know, it's like tran fired blockchain they don't know about, you know, Ethan and all the dogmatic wars that go on between the different blockchains.
00:22:22.418 - 00:22:52.320, Speaker C: Yeah. And so it's like how do I onboard money here? Like what wallet? How do I get it out of my bank account versus, oh, you're, you're on Solana. I don't trust Solana. So I think that's really the discussions that we're having, which leads us to double down on product here that makes sense over time. Go multichain. But again, we're pretty encouraged, especially with the recent visa news. Visa is going to settle USDC on Solana.
00:22:52.320 - 00:23:07.004, Speaker C: And why are they doing that? It's a result of customers asking them to be on a fast, cheap blockchain, an efficient blockchain. So that, I think, signals at least some institutional demand for the network.
00:23:07.304 - 00:23:46.484, Speaker A: For sure. That was actually going to be my next question. You mentioned earlier arbitrum, which to me, if I were to make parcel from scratch today in this market, feels like the best fit because you just see all these perp protocols pop up and do really well. Even hyper liquid, within a month of friendtech coming out, they have a perp out and people are using it to get exposure to that thematically. And so it does feel like that Djen crowd that wants access to these crazy instruments to take different views. It exists in arbitrum today. But your point makes a ton of sense, which is, does that really translate to broader adoption once we're out of this bear cycle? And is that the best user experience for people?
00:23:46.984 - 00:24:42.828, Speaker C: Yeah, I think if it was from scratch, it would. The thing that we as a development team, we have limited resources. So it's like you're getting product feedback from people who really want to use it. How do we need to make it better? We have a new version coming out soon, which just helps scales liquidity and adjust some of the fees that may have been punitive to traders. So it's either address that feedback or halts product development and port to solidity and create hooks for the various l two s. And so we're opting for the first and then we can assess from there. The idea is you want the best product to move over or else the feedback gets really messy in terms of how we want to design the product roadmap going forward.
00:24:42.828 - 00:25:00.074, Speaker C: So I think we're getting into a place where we're going to be on our third version of the platform. Two was way better than one, we think three is going to be better than two. And it closer to a place that we're comfortable potentially going multi chain.
00:25:02.054 - 00:25:34.694, Speaker B: Just wondering about the actual mechanics that are going on under the hood. Say that you're dealing with a city which has, you think an average price of $100 per square foot. So if someone is longing, that is the price. Moving away from that. Is it an AMM model? So yeah. How is all of that sort of mechanics working? And then maybe my follow on is how are you trying to balance it and make sure basically that you don't lose your shirt when it goes all out of balance.
00:25:35.634 - 00:26:12.174, Speaker C: Yeah. So a little history. So we started with, and sorry, when I say we, it's in reference to the development company we started with. Kind of what you said earlier with the CDP AmM combo. So basically, let's just say Brooklyn trade, the $500 square foot. Someone would have to come in and mint that in a debt position or like a vault. Then you've minted a synthetic Brooklyn token and then they would pull that with USCC to create an amm trading experience.
00:26:12.174 - 00:26:56.490, Speaker C: What we found in that is the peg would deviate because there's no natural way to bring that back down. So that dollar 500 to get bid up to infinity and there's not a way to bring it back down. So that's what we went to to our v two, which is a PvP. Amen. So it's everyone gets the price that the oracle prints. What changes is so longs pay shorts and then there's optional liquidity providers. There's an LP token that kind of bears the.
00:26:56.490 - 00:27:46.514, Speaker C: It's like the accounting mechanism such that it alters depending on trader P and L. So if traders lose money, the token that starts at one goes up. If they make money, it goes down. Generally speaking, the way in which balance is achieved is through a funding rate and skew costs. So if you're on the dominant side, if something is 50% or more long and you add to the long, you'll pay of funding rate and vice versa. If you're on the short side of that, you're receiving funding. So there's balancing mechanisms to ensure that SKU doesn't get too far out of whack to impair the capital provided by the other side or liquidity providers.
00:27:46.514 - 00:28:30.064, Speaker C: Where we're going is a simpler model. Even still, one LP pool for all markets right now there's a pool for each. So one LP pool that is effectively a margin facility and it underwrites all trades long and short versus right now it's pretty fragmented. So the new model, more simple, same funding rate mechanics, you'll still have skew impact fees. We do think there are some enhancements to the funding rate to make it such that it's not as punitive and that will help, I think scale liquidity, those things taken in combination.
00:28:31.364 - 00:28:44.184, Speaker A: So far, just based on initial user feedback and adoption, has there been any surprising findings or particular instruments that you found people really like that have informed your roadmap?
00:28:45.144 - 00:29:38.514, Speaker C: Yeah, we've had a few kind of large players wanting more liquidity. I think they'll see an opportunity to create investment strategies on top of parcel in which they can actually charge management fees. So a hedge fund could have a pool of capital dedicated to a liquid real estate trading strategy underpinned by parcel. So in order for that to happen, fees need to be appropriate, especially in relation to volatility. I think thats one of the things that I dont know, its not so clear. The bitcoin per funding rates can be very high because the volatility of the asset is very high. So try to tinker with that and get it to a good spot thats manageable and digestible for people and then liquidity as well.
00:29:38.514 - 00:29:50.374, Speaker C: But I think the feedback is somewhat aligned with the thesis of wanting to be able to trade real estate just like any other asset class.
00:29:59.834 - 00:30:15.304, Speaker A: How do you think that liquidity will flow in in the next two years or maybe by the next bull run? What do you think? Is the key strategy there a potential token, a part of that? Or is it just continuing to build up the product offering and catering to these kind of bigger players that want to use it?
00:30:15.844 - 00:30:59.744, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah that's a good. That's a great question. So we've been pretty organic. Yeah we haven't, everything to date has been generally organic in terms of like incentives. We have wanted to be, we wanted to make sure that the product is in a good spot because you don't have that many shots on goal in terms of incentives. So we're really excited about a loyalty program that we're going to line up with v three. I think that'll be kind of like the precursor to further distribution of the network.
00:30:59.744 - 00:31:32.954, Speaker C: And that'll be the points will be awarded for actions on the platform such as liquidity provision, open interest, balancing markets. So if the market is really tilted long, you get extra points for being short. That'll be phase one of the program and then we can layer on things like referrals etcetera and then eventually we can look into further decentralization if it makes sense.
00:31:33.414 - 00:32:09.294, Speaker B: I do feel like this points meta. It definitely seems to be leading the way, doesn't it, going into hopefully the next bull market. I mean a lot of people do push back against it and say that the teams can sort of change their rewards, the eventual rewards at a later point and that maybe it's like heads I win, tails you lose. The team can always choose how they're going to play it. How are you seeing it? Because it does seem sensible and I suppose at least you can really sort of hit those KPI's that are most important to you and to your platform with it. But yeah, just wanting to get your view on that.
00:32:10.074 - 00:33:12.364, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, I think it's kind of like click anything. You know, it can be games. If the team is acting good faith then you know, there's some planning ahead of what the points are actually for and those targets stay relatively stagnant and intact. Yeah, I think it's a good thing overall. Obviously in any, whether it's points or any other anything, if there's funny business or a contract that kind of one party is not holding their end, like that's not going to end well, you know. So it's about just staying to your word, as good, as good as you can and then in the health, for the health of the actual product. So if there's like a lot of gaming, you know, it goes both ways, right? Because it's like if you know, you put out something, you hope that it is acting as intended.
00:33:12.364 - 00:33:57.140, Speaker C: However, if it's not and then it, it becomes toxic. Like the team has to have the right to not make it toxic for the people that are here for the utility of the product. So, you know, if that's the reasoning, I think that's fair because it's being driven by malicious is a strong word, but it's driven by behavior that's not healthy. So I am in favor of that. And you know, that's kind of like the benefit of poor. You know, they're kind of, they're kind of out there and they're not anything, but they are something. So, you know, the goal is to have them be worth something.
00:33:57.140 - 00:34:05.024, Speaker C: They're definitely going to be worth something. We're going to stick true to what we say and anything that changes will be very well communicated.
00:34:05.524 - 00:34:35.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's one of the key challenges that we saw with early, let's call them vampire attackers. Like, look, swayer, things like that, where before the debut of point systems, you kind of just attracted all the mercenary capitalists and they would script the protocol for everyone else and all the data would get all out of whack with the wasp trading. So I think it makes sense to decouple the actual issuance of the token, create that gap correct for any bad behavior, so on and so forth, and try to get the alignment as tight as possible with the end user.
00:34:36.354 - 00:35:17.614, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. You want to be able to, it's like lower risk tokenomics, and you can then see what works and what doesn't because when it's in the code, it's permanent for the most part. So this is a way to do it in a way because in theory that people are stakeholders of the platform, and so the goal of everyone should be to have the most balanced, the healthiest dynamics possible. And so anything that alters from that needs to be adjusted, and that's for the benefit of the project as a whole.
00:35:18.314 - 00:36:07.192, Speaker A: One actually broader point I want to touch on is, and this is true for a lot of projects, but I think especially for you guys, just given how tethered real estate markets are to macro versus I think a lot of people have the view that crypto might be decoupling from equities and risk on assets. And whether that plays out or not remains to be seen. But certainly real estate is very much more in lockstep with macro. Whats been your experience so far? Because you started back when the markets were obviously in a better spot, I think for a lot of us, and now were skating towards this different regime from a macro standpoint and no way to put it. Yeah, yeah. And all of these cities are probably going to be pretty correlated. So just how do you, how do you think about building in this current economic environment in terms of the macro.
00:36:07.248 - 00:36:10.632, Speaker C: Or how the trades are related?
00:36:10.808 - 00:36:25.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a little bit of both. Just, just macro. Like maybe there's a scenario where like real estate falls off a cliff just broadly and like how that could impact the platform. Or maybe it's an opportunity for people too, because you take the other side. It's just how do you view that landscape?
00:36:26.574 - 00:36:55.464, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say so, yeah. Macro. I mean, I'll start with like building and a different macro. You know, we did our first version last July. I would say things peak probably in April of 2022. Capital was flowing in last July. Was it bad though? And then I think FTX kind of just, yeah, crushed doesn't nail the thing.
00:36:55.464 - 00:37:50.890, Speaker C: Yeah, because it was like it was going down, but there wasn't like a real, like, oh, wow, like everyone needs to pull their money out situation. It was kind of like, oh, like, you know, bubble burst, but not like a huge fraud in which like everyone was invested in large amounts of money. So at least from their equity perspective, so it just makes it harder to, the trust goes out the window. I think Solana gets the added benefit of being associated with that and then capital just dries up. Overall, people lost a lot of money across everywhere, so there's less money to go in from a, for us. Generally speaking, when you really think about it, real estate versus USDC. Oh, of course.
00:37:50.890 - 00:39:06.194, Speaker C: And then the USDC deep was like another thing. But the circle handled that well, giving us more confidence in our choice to be with them. So, yeah, we're really us dollars versus real estate when you think about it. And, you know, we use blockchain as the settlement layer and the exchange layer. Nonetheless, I think a lot of the, like, onboarding and there's just like that still, like that the wallet situation and there's just still a lot of friction for which I, which the reason why I'm bringing that up is that if, um, this space is in a better place from a macro perspective, innovation happens faster because there's funding and there's teams coming here and there's talent. And so if that goes the other way, like, the problems get solved slower because there's not teams working on the biggest pain points, things there would seem quite easy, just like a better wallet infrastructure, onboarding, et cetera, making it like very, very simple. It just happens at a slower pace.
00:39:06.194 - 00:39:59.424, Speaker C: And then lastly, with respect to the market themselves, there's been a decent dispersion. So a, we're neutral, so it's a venue for long and short. And then when you think about most investments, at least nowadays, are most of the time correlated with interest rates. Thats from crypto at the far end to maybe housing or actual bonds at the low end. So I think thats obviously always going to be a function when it comes to the markets themselves. Theres been a decent amount of dispersion across them. I think at the beginning of the year, most markets were up, but some like a lot more than others.
00:39:59.424 - 00:40:22.624, Speaker C: It just like Boston was like on fire, billy on fire. And that's still like Boston, up like 20% in six months, which earned three months, which is just crazy to see. And that would outpace anything else by like 10%. So you could still run like a neutral strategy even if they're all up by picking the relative order.
00:40:23.184 - 00:41:19.684, Speaker B: In my head, Im trying to work out how big this market could be. And to do that, Im trying to work out who are going to be the guys who are really going to love this product, because I think theres one potential issue that some people have, which is if youre a large institution, you want to gain exposure to real estate, you can invest in REITs and ETF's, and if you want residential, you could go for ones that specialize in PRS, private rental sector. But what they also spit out is the yield which you're getting from that real estate. So they have to forfeit that in order to use your product. Likewise, if you can't afford a home yourself, you could own a share of a home and again, you could receive the yield that would come from that. So do you think that that could be an issue? Does it impact the market size and who do you think are going to be the guys to really benefit from the product offering?
00:41:21.064 - 00:42:18.664, Speaker C: Yes, I think it's different. It's a different product. Obviously, real estate's a great investment and I wouldn't anticipate people foregoing the actual physical to, well, especially at these, if money's not a factor. At the same time, I would say that on that side in particular hedging, reducing risk, reducing volatility on the short side, because theres no way to actually short is a large opportunity. Portfolio protection, portfolio insurance, native price insurance. I think that market for the institutions actually is probably bigger than the long side. And again, I think theres a large retail market here because at least the younger generation like their shot of owning a home that they like to live in is shrinking.
00:42:18.664 - 00:43:08.804, Speaker C: And then a lot of the bigger players are actually buying homes for rent, the SFR single family rental space. So I think that that would be like the balancing mechanism there. And then hedge funds just if there's a route to create a product to charge fees on and you have liquidity, I think that's really the key here. The threads of needle between what you're saying on the institutional side versus retail, it's like the bigger, that's highly active managed, highly active managed money. And the reason why they'd be interested is because they can create products like new products there and charge fees.
00:43:14.384 - 00:44:04.688, Speaker B: I completely agree on the hedging side. I was looking up before this interview about how do real estate companies who are developing the properties themselves actually hedge against the possibility that the rents are going to come down and they don't really have anything. All I could really see is that they hedge against the interest rates going up because obviously they're borrowing, they're leveraging up to acquire and to develop these assets. So you do generally hedge that risk out, but I don't think they really do anything to hedge out the possibility that the market you're building in is actually the demand is going to fall away, that there could be a Covid-19 incident, there could be a 2008 financial crisis incident, or it could just be the fad moves on to a new location and there isn't really an easy way to mitigate that risk. And these big corporations, they want all the risks to be hedged.
00:44:04.776 - 00:44:58.814, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like they're okay to forp it. The individual could be like let it ride. But I think in the larger side, what does reducing risk mean? It means that you can, it really means that you can add more leverage or get more cash. Like the lower risk you are, the more dollars you can hold, whether that be natively or through leverage. You know you could borrow against a t bill, you know you can borrow against the government in much bigger dollars than you could borrow against, you know, ethereum because one is way riskier than the other or like a different type of stock. So I think that's really the key for them is isolating. What are the returns they're seeking to get? Maybe it is for the market.
00:44:58.814 - 00:45:21.934, Speaker C: They think Nashville is going up and thats their thesis. Or they think they could make the home nicer and flip it based on the home itself. And they dont want the underlying market risk, they just want to lock in. I can add a kitchen, bathrooms. This is the profit that I can expect to return. So it makes the returns more predictable as well.
00:45:22.734 - 00:45:58.162, Speaker A: So Trevor, you're obviously super deep into all of this real estate data, would love to get your view on where you see this sector going. You brought up some interesting points, such as young people feel like they're priced out of the houses they want as well as just the fact that interest rates are up and people are spending more of their income on interest payments versus principal on their mortgages. What are you noticing? Just higher level. Where is real estate going and what impact do you think that will have? What trends are you paying attention to, Preston?
00:45:58.178 - 00:46:59.596, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say that I've been pretty surprised at the resilience of the markets generally. I think it was widely consensus that at the beginning of the year, post the rally of, of rates, that home prices would go down and they all went like up ten or 20%, which is pretty surprising. They've cooled off a little, but it would come back some. So it's puzzling, I would say, to figure out why. One potential reason is there's just a huge mishmash of, or maybe like a stalemate. Um, obviously if you have a 3% mortgage, um, you don't want to, if you sell it unless you have all equity, right. And you could put that as a down payment, like there's not a really a place to go, uh, because now your payment, especially on interest, will be double or more.
00:46:59.596 - 00:48:06.210, Speaker C: So you know, and then an economy that's like fine, but not what seems fine, I don't actually know, but um, it seems okay. If you're not like materially increasing your net worth or your income, like what gives? So I think people are not selling and then buyers aren't willing to take the 8% mortgage really. So there's a lack of transactions and then on the back of that we're seeing a ton of single family rental acceleration. There's players that we're used to, but then more and more people, or more and more institutions are raising capital to buy homes because they can either acquire mortgages at a lower rate or borrow against other assets that they have in order to make the economics work. So that's a trend that could be a very large trend in the future, is a single family rental market.
00:48:06.362 - 00:48:30.374, Speaker A: So I've seen so many headlines about that kind of movement and I guess a lot of concern amongst retail people like why are these big institutions buying up all these houses and renting out the neighborhoods? Essentially, I guess my question is why is it really just a return thing? Why the interest in single family homes now for these bigger players? Is there something else that we're missing here?
00:48:31.244 - 00:49:28.954, Speaker C: I dont know why now its accelerating for sure. I think if they can capture an arbitrage on the interest rates, you have more demand, right? If they can get a. I dont know what rates are getting, but its definitely lower than the market. So if they can capture that spread less financially, theyre insensitive almost to the home prices. And whereas the consumer is very sensitive to interest rates and mortgage rates, so they could capture that and then charge whatever the property would deem as the appropriate mortgage payment, and they could get that back via that spread. So I mean, that is one thesis, and then it's just more profitable versus some of the other things they were doing before. Especially.
00:49:28.954 - 00:50:13.084, Speaker C: The other thing is like commercial is kind of with work from home. It's like you used to invest in commercial property, but vacancy rates are up or underutilized. So where are they going to put the cash that they once were deploying? I don't think you really want to deploy into commercial. There's probably enough inventory to satisfy demand or probably way. There's probably a lot more inventory than demand. So they're looking for other avenues to deploy capital in real estate and homes. Obviously, given the dynamics that I just mentioned, are attractive, especially if they can capture a better mortgage rate than the consumer.
00:50:15.024 - 00:50:38.016, Speaker B: I'd love to get your take on how you see the future of real world assets in crypto, and specifically with regards to real estate, because did you look at that as a potential option more what homebase, another project on Solana are doing to actually fractionalize real assets and bring them onto blockchain. Do you think that works with real estate?
00:50:38.120 - 00:51:02.882, Speaker C: I think it, yeah. So those are the home based guys. Great. They're friends and they're awesome. I think it works at scale. I think to get there, as I mentioned at the very beginning, it takes time and money to get enough scale. And those two things obviously are the scarcest things in the world.
00:51:02.882 - 00:51:48.594, Speaker C: So I think the way that we're coming at it in the future, ideally would be able to unlock some of that. Right. How do you have a secondary market if there's no price in order to mark the positions against. It's the same exact problem as the v one, where you don't have a peg. So ideally in the future, if homebase had a bunch of properties in Soho, we have a Soho price feed. They can mark the shares of Soho, their properties in Soho, against the price feed to allow trading between those two things. And then you get more liquidity in the space overall versus now it's just home by home.
00:51:48.594 - 00:52:57.096, Speaker C: And those homes can fill up really fast. You can't really satisfy the actual underlying pent up demands one by one. So you need a way to unlock it. I think that's our goal, is to be able to unlock that liquidity at the physical layer. I think you do that by having a dynamic, like, dynamic pricing layer. And then with respect to the other real world, some of the this kind of goes back to my other point where more funding into the space that helps automate a lot of the process, like deeds, verification of the counterparty, counterparty risk, etcetera, the more automated and advanced that can get. I think it would help a lot because you can loan and know that who you're loaning to, you know, is trustworthy and credit worthy, and there's recourse if the loan goes bad or, you know, there's all that stuff that is very manual today and that would maybe less so.
00:52:57.096 - 00:53:16.764, Speaker C: I mean, there's tenant risk, of course, and like damage like fires and floods, etcetera. But on the other side of real world assets, where you're lending against businesses and cars, so you just need a lot of that infrastructure to spin up.
00:53:17.624 - 00:53:56.514, Speaker A: I want to, actually, because just based on this response you gave, it reminded me of some earlier points you made and kind of shift over to the operator side of building parcel, where it's not just about building the protocol and these instruments for people to trade. It's all of the necessary infrastructure that goes around it, whether it's the off chain stuff or the on chain stuff. You mentioned earlier some pain points with just the wallet experience in and of itself creating friction for users. Talk to us a bit about what pain points you're feeling as a builder in this space. What things do you think we still need to work on and improve to actually make this a piece of technology that a lot of people could use?
00:53:58.844 - 00:54:22.304, Speaker C: Yeah. So, you know, funny enough, I think Phantom is the best wallet and it's just more seamless than the other options. Yeah. The more abstractable it can get, such that it feels just like a regular app. Yeah. It's not. So it's just.
00:54:22.304 - 00:55:06.286, Speaker C: It's foreign. It's not hard. It's just not what people are used to. So I think that's really something that we try to build as much of those in on ramps, we integrate moonpay, but the more that it can just look and feel like a wallet in some sort of abstracted way would be, I think the best thing. Just so it's the blockchain part. The best part of it, which is the efficiency that you can have running on one of these networks, is abstracted and it's just very clean, clear. It's just.
00:55:06.286 - 00:55:19.922, Speaker C: We're working to that. I feel like it should have been here by now, but it's still one of those. It's kind of like a per. It's elusive to some respects.
00:55:20.018 - 00:55:34.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. I have the view that the era of like chrome browser wallets is. It's getting towards the end. I don't think that's how most people are going to use crypto, especially Mark Cuban lost a million bucks on his metamask.
00:55:34.914 - 00:55:36.138, Speaker C: He can't figure it out.
00:55:36.226 - 00:55:37.242, Speaker A: I don't think anyone can.
00:55:37.298 - 00:56:00.520, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, and then like to see like that type of stuff, like, you know, some sort of backup, something where it's just like if you lose this twelve word thing, you're completely out of luck. Like, you know, that's, that's very risky. You know, that like brings the addressable market down by probably a pretty good amount.
00:56:00.672 - 00:56:01.544, Speaker A: Definitely.
00:56:01.704 - 00:56:12.082, Speaker C: You know, things like that where it's just like the niceties that we, everyone has created to date just building on top of that and not moving, moving backward.
00:56:12.218 - 00:56:28.050, Speaker A: Right, right. You know, I'm personally bullish. Things like NPC wallets that we saw experiments with this with friend tech where it's, you know, headless transaction signing, no pop ups and log in with your email or your phone. You shard the key on the device. That stuff I think, yeah, the app.
00:56:28.082 - 00:56:41.220, Speaker C: That they made was really cool how it's like a app but it's downloaded from the browser, so you kind of go around. Yeah, that was, that was smooth. That experience was really cool.
00:56:41.332 - 00:56:59.224, Speaker A: Totally, totally. Well, I think we're getting towards the end here, but I think closing question for me, and you brought up earlier, v three s on the horizon. What features is it going to bring out? It looks like the loyalty program is going to be a big part of it, but what else should we be excited for?
00:57:00.324 - 00:57:51.154, Speaker C: Yeah, so v three will be a better user experience from multiple facets. I think scaling liquidity allows a broader set of people to enter the market and play in the size that they want. That's the main feature. But we'll also be adding incremental features to the portfolio page, which is where you can track, uh, your investments over time. Uh, before we didn't have the indexing, uh, capability, uh, we just hadn't prioritized it. But uh, we'll have indexing to, to wallets and all transactions. So you can have a nice review of exactly what you're going to be or exactly how your performance over, um, any period of time.
00:57:51.154 - 00:58:10.516, Speaker C: Um, and then yeah, loyalty points as well. So starting to bring the community a walk for the ride again. We'll start with the first version. We're really excited about it. And then we'll continue to enhance loyalty points and then eventually figure out how to deploy those points further to the users.
00:58:10.620 - 00:58:19.424, Speaker B: Are you also looking to improve the market data? Because I had a quick look earlier and you had absorption rates and things like that. So is that another area that you're looking to build out?
00:58:20.404 - 00:58:27.352, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll continue to add metrics and things that help people make investment decision.
00:58:27.528 - 00:58:42.204, Speaker A: Amazing. It looks like quite the feature set to be excited for. Well, Trevor, thank you so much for taking the time to join us and talking about all things parcel. It's been on our docket to kind of do a deep dive into this for a while now. So excited that we finally made it happen.
00:58:42.904 - 00:58:45.544, Speaker C: All right, guys, thanks so much. Really appreciate the time. Awesome.
