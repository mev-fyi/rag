00:00:14.640 - 00:00:48.700, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayer, the show where we explore next gen blockchains. I'm your host, Saul, and today Zen is standing in for Dave. And together we are joined by Isaac, aka Snomi, who is the co founder of Gator Labs, where he hopes to design incentive systems that lead to better societal outcomes at scale. Their first product, which is an open beta, is called Chomp, which you may have seen on Twitter. Chomp is a quiz game that leverages wisdom of the crowd to get you the best answers, and it's available to use today. Isaac, thank you so much for joining us today.
00:00:49.080 - 00:00:52.730, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to be here. Thank you very much for having me on. Appreciate it.
00:00:52.920 - 00:01:12.850, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think one thing I want to start off with is just your background and how it kind of positioned you to build what's essentially kind of a quiz game that gamifies multiple human behaviors. Tell us a bit about how you landed on this particular project, given what you been working on before.
00:01:13.950 - 00:02:58.430, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, you know, I think I've always been, like, interested in human behavior. I studied neuroscience and specifically psychobiology and undergrad, and then I actually went into advertising when I decided I didn't really want to be a doctor. And advertising is all about human behavior and how to get people to buy something or create an emotion with some sort of creative that speaks to people in kind of some way. And then I went back to grad school, and I was in a PhD program for economics out in California at Claremont, and then kind of learned a lot about human behavior at scale, in a different kind of sense from the economic side, as opposed to how can you trigger specific actions with creative or words, how can you do that with incentives? And then actually dropped out of my ECOM program at the end of 2021, the start of 2022, after I got my masters and started working in crypto around the space doing different token designs and incentive systems. I've worked on a lot of different things from AAA game economies to stable coins to interest rate models to kind of like everything in between on figuring out how to get people to do something with incentives or with some sort of an economic system.
00:02:58.810 - 00:03:07.374, Speaker C: So this was part of. Just to clarify, this was part of. You have another project as well called Hexagon Research.
00:03:07.422 - 00:05:07.138, Speaker B: I have a company called Hexagon Research that does, like consulting, and that's what I've been doing most like this work through for the past couple years. And then last August, I met KZ, my co founder, at the Salona hacker house in Berlin, and we kind of hit it off and got to talking about a lot of kind of like, the things that we believe about crypto and ways that we can use blockchains to make the world slightly more equitable and kind of add context and opportunities to the world that don't currently exist that we think push it in the right direction. And so we started to think about information a lot. Um, and the idea that, like, it, there's a lot of problems with information, like in crypto and outside of crypto specifically, uh, but within crypto, obviously, like, there's scams and rugs and, you know, um, people don't really know where to go to figure out what is real or what isn't. Um, and it's pretty difficult and can be pretty scary for a lot of, like, new participants. And so that was kind of something that we started to think about is, like, how can we create kind of like, education systems or information systems that create this sort of information for those types of users as sort of like an externality of, like, the economic system or the product? And we eventually kind of landed on a game that's initially targeted to crypto people. And we mostly talk about crypto related things for right now, but that is really generalizable and can be done for really any topic.
00:05:07.138 - 00:06:27.090, Speaker B: And so while we're kind of starting within crypto and kind of want to get crypto users, as our beta testers, who understand some of the tech on the backend and how to use tokens and wallets and things like that, but I think our vision for this is a lot larger than just crypto information. We think that, in general, the information landscape of the world sucks, and there's a lot of things missing from it, and there's a lot of things that are trying to explicitly manipulate you or bias you or get you to make some decision that maybe you don't necessarily want to make, and you just don't really know all of that. It's already very difficult to tell what's AI generated and what's not. I get fooled every now and then because I'm not paying super tight attention all the time. And so there's just seemingly, like, a lot of context missing. What do other people think about this? Or what are other people's opinions without having to go through hours and hours of Reddit pages and googling and talking to chat GPT about things? How can you.
00:06:29.550 - 00:06:52.332, Speaker C: Sorry to interrupt you here, but I guess this is a good point to actually dive into what Gator the app is. Maybe we can step back for a second before we dive into the incentives because I think it'll give the audience a little bit of a clearer understanding of what you're talking about. So maybe you could just describe Gator at a high level and how it works and the general decision making principle behind it.
00:06:52.516 - 00:08:02.772, Speaker B: Yeah, so Gator and Chomp are slightly different. So Gator is kind of like the company that we have that makes chomp the product. And so Chomp is like the first kind of game that we're making. But Gator as a company, we want to make more of these types of games that contribute to what we call our information layer or our data layer, which is basically a social graph. And so we are going to be tracking individual people and the information that they have access to that they are likely to be right in. And that's really our goal, which is, you know, how can we create, like, context for information through games? And that's really the world that we kind of see where people play these, you know, three to five minute games, ten minute games, you know, on their commute when they're, you know, on the toilet, doing nothing, on the couch, like, whatever. It's just kind of like a little bit mindless fun.
00:08:02.772 - 00:08:25.200, Speaker B: There are some incentives. There's some kind of, like, djen stuff, but it's not really, like, a lot of money, and it's more just kind of, like, enjoyable. And those are the kinds of games that we want to create that we think people really want to engage with. And Chomp is really the first one of those.
00:08:25.820 - 00:08:51.010, Speaker A: Can you give me an example of a type of information that benefits from this design pattern? I think I get what you're saying, which is, you know, you have more people partaking in these quizzes. You have human feedback that can kind of distill lots of information and get you to, I guess, the quote unquote truth. But maybe an example of what's usually hard to figure out that can be easier now through something like chomp regator.
00:08:51.350 - 00:09:37.140, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's two good examples for this that I usually give. So the first is for businesses. So if you're a business, you're spending a lot of money on product research, on user feedback, on figuring out what your users want, what they're interested in, how they think about your product, how they feel about your product. And those kinds of questions are, those kinds of research are primarily done through surveys already. And there are, you know, really, really large firms who make billions of dollars a year doing this kind of research. And this makes it significantly more accessible to almost anyone. Right.
00:09:37.140 - 00:10:36.246, Speaker B: Because if I can come and make questions and decks and then go get people to answer them, then I don't have to pay like some agency, you know, $150,000 retainer to do user feedback for me, basically. And that creates a lot of access to information if we can get the users, obviously. And the other one that's probably more interesting to users is market sentiment and trading information. This is one of my favorite examples. Let's say we asked the question is with going to hit $10 billion market cap. So when we ask this question, we have users answer two different questions in relation to, like, the question, is Wif gonna hit a $10 billion market cap? And the first question is like, what do you think? The answer to that question is like, yes, it will. No, it won't.
00:10:36.246 - 00:11:34.452, Speaker B: And then what percent of people do you think answered yes to this question? So we call this the first order question and the second order question. The first order question is, what do you believe? And the second order question is, what do you believe about other people's beliefs and this other people's beliefs aspect of it is where we pull out a lot more information. And I can go into some of the mechanism design behind the actual mechanism in a bit. But basically, if 80% of people say Wif is going to hit $10 billion, and 90% of people say, or the expectation is that on average, 90% of people would have said yes, the answer that we actually pull out on the backend here is, no, Wif will not hit $10 billion. And this isn't necessarily like a prediction. It's not going to say like, oh, no, this is never going to hit $10 billion. It's more of like a sentiment test to see how the market is kind of like thinking about it.
00:11:34.452 - 00:12:35.500, Speaker B: And if you think this through, this is actually counter intuitively the correct answer. So if 80% of people already think this asset is going to go to $10 billion, and it's at, I don't know, $2 billion, right? That's a five x. So why wouldn't I hold this asset? So you can kind of assume that everyone who says, yes, this asset is going to go to $10 billion is already exposed in some way to this asset. And so that's 80% of the population. And then at the same time, people are basing their second order answers like what they believe about other people's beliefs on generally their circle of interaction and the people and information that they interact with on a more regular daily basis. And so you're getting all these people in crypto to say, I'm exposed to this asset, and I think this assets can to go up a lot. And then they're also saying that my friends and the people that I know and interact with are also exposed to this asset, and they also think it's going to go up a lot.
00:12:35.500 - 00:13:09.100, Speaker B: And so if that's true and that's the case, who's left to buy the asset? So in the market, the sentiment is actually like, no, this may not just go up because everyone thinks it's going to continue going up. And so if you think about it, like, who are the participants left that are going to come in? Well, you can say, oh, retail, who's not here yet, or other people who we can dump our bags on or whatever, but all things staying the same, that's actually the correct result there, which is super interesting.
00:13:10.080 - 00:13:40.830, Speaker C: So I guess diving into the mechanism design behind that, it seems a little bit dependent on the question you ask as to how you would interpret, like, the primary and secondary answer. So how do you automate that? Or do you have, like, a different way of, like, does every question that gets submitted need to have, like, a certain, you know, backend, like, way of understanding the data that comes in? How do you. How do you kind of, like, do that across, like, a wide, standardized.
00:13:41.370 - 00:14:28.020, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry, we've standardized the asking or, sorry, the answering a lot. So generally the answers are yes, no answers for right now. We'll add multiple choice answers in the next month or two, hopefully, or more multiple choice answers. At least we have some that's very standardized. You're basically answering the same question. But to your point, the words that you pick in a question really matter, and they change the outcome of the question, or they can change the outcome of the question. Framing bias is something that we think about a lot when we're making questions and how to eliminate framing bias.
00:14:28.020 - 00:15:19.280, Speaker B: There's different kind of biases in there as well, but framing bias is probably the biggest one. And so we don't necessarily have, like, an explicit process for, like, creating the questions, but we have, like, a five or six page, like, design document for, like, how to write a good question. It's like, you know, be as specific as possible, like, leave nothing to interpretation. Don't use, like, jargon or acronyms, you know, like, remove framing biases or, like, emotionally charged words, like, all of that kind of, like, good stuff that basically talks about different ways that the end answer that you get may not be the answer that you were actually looking for when you ask that question.
00:15:19.940 - 00:15:41.410, Speaker A: So maybe now is a good time to go back to some of the earlier points you brought up, which is, you know, how do you define better information? What makes it better? Is it kind of this framework you're enshrining around the process of collecting multiple answers to the same question? How would you describe that?
00:15:42.710 - 00:16:37.462, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a couple pieces to this. The first one is that kind of like, as I described, 80% of people say yes, the answer can still be no. And wisdom of the crowd. Most people think like, democratic governance, democracy, pure voting, that kind of thing. There's a lot more to the wisdom of the crowd than just more than 50% of people vote this. So this is the answer. And what we do with the mechanisms that we, or the mechanism that we currently use, which is called surprisingly popular, basically, we're calling that the best answer because it's not necessarily the right answer or true in theory.
00:16:37.462 - 00:17:50.496, Speaker B: This mechanism with answers that have objective resolutions, what's the capital of Illinois? Or what's the capital of Saudi Arabia at large scale with a sufficient sample size will always pull out the correct answer, which is very interesting. And so we obviously don't have super large sample sizes and we're asking subjective questions. And so we call things like the best answer because it's not necessarily true or right. It's the best answer that we have right now, and that is going to get a lot more contextualized over the next months and years as we continue to build. So right now we have surprisingly popular one mechanism. We've also been working on the implementation of another mechanism called population mean base aggregation, which will hopefully be ready soon. And we're also working on a couple other mechanisms that are slightly further out on the background.
00:17:50.496 - 00:19:13.686, Speaker B: And so it's not just going to be one mechanism to answer, it's going to be how can we continually refine the mechanisms that we come across or create to be more consistent in terms of the outputs? And now we'll have all of these data and all of these answers on how people responded to them. And we can really test a lot of this mechanism design with data that really just doesn't exist anywhere else. And then on top of that, we have what we call the likelihood score and the reputation scoring. So the likelihood score is something that we hope contextualizes the best answer a lot, which is basically how that will work, is it'll be on an S curve. So if we have no idea whether or not the best answer is likely to be true, it's like at 50, so it's like right in the middle of that S curve, and then it can move up along the S curve and eventually, maybe after like years, get to like 99% likely to be true. Or it could go the opposite direction and be like 1% likely to be true. Um, but the best answer is not something that, like, you get from like one sample.
00:19:13.686 - 00:19:52.200, Speaker B: Uh, it's not something you get from a small sample size, and it's not something that you get from sampling at one point in time. Um, this is something that should be continuous and fairly like, amorphic and kind of like, um, change a lot of as people's opinions change. And it will occasionally be wrong. Right. It's certainly not to say, like, okay, these are just like always true answers and we're gonna get everything right. And, you know, we're the single source of truth for the Internet. Like, that's ridiculous, right? Like, no one will ever achieve that because that's just impossible.
00:19:52.200 - 00:20:48.370, Speaker B: And I can go into a long spiel about why, why that's impossible. But our hope is really to make these kinds of games and metrics through the mechanism design that make the information better through contextualizing that information and kind of showing you what other people think. What? Like even asking the questions themselves. Like, people are like, oh, like, this is a weird question, this makes no sense. But someone else is like, oh, I love this question. Like, I'm so glad somebody else asked this question is thinking this way. And it's what we've seen so far is really forcing people to kind of like confront some of the biases that they have that are implicit towards, you know, people or things or groups.
00:20:48.370 - 00:21:18.460, Speaker B: And that's something that we think definitely makes it better than kind of like existing things. But yeah, the reason that we think the information is better is because the outputs themselves aren't just the raw outputs of democratic voting. And then on top of that raw output, we'll have multiple outputs, and then we'll have ways of scoring those outputs to contextualize for users. And just in summary.
00:21:19.440 - 00:21:43.220, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess, how do you collect the data in general, this sounds like it requires people to be answering a lot of questions. So I imagine you have some sort of incentive layer. That's what makes it work. So I assume that's why it's on a blockchain. And so, yeah. How do you think about designing the incentive layer for this? How do you get people to use it? Maybe you can go into some detail about that.
00:21:43.910 - 00:22:34.142, Speaker B: Yeah, so we definitely need a lot of user input and data, which making interesting questions is really important for us and making content fun that people want to contribute to. And yeah, as you said, the incentives are very important, but it's not just the incentives. So I'll go into the incentives in a sec. I just want to touch on the funness. So the games being fun are way more powerful than the economic incentives. There are constraints to the economic system where you can't really give out large incentives. And so the incentive isn't the thing that creates sticky behavior change.
00:22:34.142 - 00:23:52.970, Speaker B: The fun is the thing that creates sticky behavior change, like whether or not people enjoy answering the questions and revealing the answers to the questions and seeing what the best answer is and kind of betting on whether or not their guess was good, that funness is really what's going to keep users kind of coming back, or hopefully, but the incentives are also very important, right? Because if you screw the incentives up, the output of the information can't be trusted. So there's a game theoretic model for this where it's basically like, okay, we need to incentivize the honor strategy. And that's the first step. It's like, okay, can we incentivize the honest strategy? And then the second. And so the users are just guessing what they actually think. And then the second step is how do we make this system, at least internally manipulation proof? So how do you design the incentives such that anybody who wants to attack the system create an output with one of the answers wouldn't make any money?
00:23:53.430 - 00:24:10.116, Speaker C: There's a problem, just to maybe summarize for a second here. So the issue here is that me as a user, technically, I could just try to answer what I think everyone else is going to answer because that would give me the best rewards on the platform.
00:24:10.188 - 00:24:54.662, Speaker B: Right? Right. So that's like your keynesian beauty contest, and we actually have that programmed in. Right, because you're already answering what you think other people answer. And so the first order answer should be like your answer. And the second order answer is the Kinesh beauty contest of like what you think other people are answering. And basically like you want to create the incentive so that in both questions, in both cases, like, the user is incentivized, like their maximally profitable thing to do, an expectation is to just be honest. This is what I think, not, oh, this is what I think the keynesian beauty contest outcome will be where, you know, everyone's trying to guess what everyone else thinks.
00:24:54.662 - 00:25:40.832, Speaker B: It's like, everyone else will guess that they think this, but you want to incentivize, like the actual honest strategy. And by separating those two questions, we actually are able to do that. And so the incentive here is primarily actually on the second order question. And so it's basically, you know, an exponential curve around, like, the actual estimator. So the average say it's like 80. If you're depending on the, like, this is a little bit like, mathy and complicated, but depending on how far you are from that, you get some amount of additional reward. And we actually just upped this reward.
00:25:40.832 - 00:26:26.402, Speaker B: So if you get the second order estimate exactly correct, like, you guessed, 80%, people will say yes. And the average is actually 80% of people saying yes, then you're going to get five times as much bonk as you would have otherwise. And we use Bonk as our in game currency for right now. We'll launch our own token for our own incentives in the future. But we're kind of validating and getting a lot of information data for the economy through bonk right now. But so the incentive structure is designed to basically get people to only input, like what they truly think. And I actually have an article on this in the works right now, and what the optimal guessing strategy is.
00:26:26.402 - 00:26:57.740, Speaker B: There's like four or five different cases where a user thinks that they know more than everyone else, a user thinks that everyone else knows more than they do. The user disagrees with the majority, the user agrees with the majority, the user disagrees with the second order answers and the probabilities. There's a few different cases that you have to prove out that this optimal guessing strategy is the honest strategy.
00:26:58.120 - 00:27:37.730, Speaker A: Let's maybe shift gears a bit and just talk about the consumer angle to all of this, which I think is really key driver for getting the data at scale, getting people excited. You mentioned that having a fun game is just way more effective than having perfectly designed economics. So this is one of the more unique consumer products I've seen in crypto. It's not like Farcaster or like another Twitter clone. It's a literal game that you can play. Tell us about kind of how you landed on this type of design and how you think this will scale into. Let's call it like, mainstream adoption.
00:27:38.590 - 00:28:57.002, Speaker B: Yeah. So we landed on this design to some extent for economics reasons, to some extent FoR, but primarily for user retention reasons. We see a lot of social applications that try to get creative, that are Feeds that are, you know, incentivizing people to come on and like, post and, you know, do, do all the Things. And it's really hard to get people to contribute to something like that without just like paying them, you know, a lot of money. And so, like, these economic models of most of these things are fundamentally broken and they don't really work very well. And so because I'm a mechanism designer, a lot of it came from kind of like that, where it was like kind of the mechanism that we discovered first, and then we put like a game around it. And the end of it is this social feed platform where you can kind of like search through information, you can see what you know.
00:28:57.002 - 00:29:51.900, Speaker B: Sal, you can ask a question and you can share it to Lama. If Llama follows you, you can show up in his feed and then the Answers would show up. But it's more of LIke a Reddit or like Kind of Quora style forum platform where people can come on, ask their questions, but they have a lot more confidence in what they're being told and a lot more understanding of kind of like, why they're being told that thing in a much kind of, like, shorter form where you don't have to spend 4 hours going down a Reddit rabbit hole. It's like, oh, this is a number that has all these different people's opinions encapsulated in it. And. Great. And so a lot of the game came from the fact that we need economic risk to drive the economy.
00:29:51.900 - 00:30:08.000, Speaker B: And so, like, how do you, you know, make risk? Well, make a game. But, yeah, it partially draws on, like, consensus protocols, like proof of stake, those kinds of things.
00:30:08.120 - 00:30:14.130, Speaker C: So does that mean that's like someone asking a question, I have to put up some bounty for it, or how does that work?
00:30:14.170 - 00:31:05.660, Speaker B: No. So the only time that users pay right now in the app is when they want to reveal the answer to the question. So you can answer questions and you can ask questions for right now, but if you want to know the answer to one of the questions that you've already answered or chomped, then you'll have to pay for that. But you also might have make money on it because you pay 5000 bonk, and then you have a chance to win at least 5000 more bonk up to what is now 50,000 bonk. It used to be 10,000, but we actually just changed this or are changing this this week. So there's a risk component to it, but you might also end up two xing your bonk, you know, instantaneously.
00:31:06.200 - 00:31:15.180, Speaker C: So isn't there, like, an incentive for me to just, like, ask a question that and then, like, manipulate the answer and then reveal it? Like, how do you, how do you deal with that?
00:31:15.880 - 00:32:09.770, Speaker B: Uh, yes, there would be if the incentives were improperly designed. So, um, you can basically guarantee that if you're 100% of the answers, that you're not profitable. Um, if you're 90% of the answers, we can still make sure that you're not profitable. And so it's, how do you parameterize that model of, like, what percent of users should end up being profitable, and how profitable should those users be? There's just a constraint of making sure that this attacker, who is some percentage of all of the answers, that that attacker isn't profitable up to some constraint. Right. Because, like, if the attacker is, like, 5% of the answers, then maybe they get it exactly right for all five of those. But they also have a much lower impact on what that answer is.
00:32:09.770 - 00:32:52.280, Speaker B: And so it's not really as obvious that they're trying to manipulate this thing to be the answer, because they can't access in all the rest of the data. They can't see everyone else's answer. And so it's not that simple to, like, manipulate. You'd really have to skew the weights and become a very high portion of the weight in the population. And once you become that high of a weight, you just won't be profitable in expectation anymore. We don't give out enough rewards in bonk to make you profitable to reveal all of those answers.
00:32:52.740 - 00:33:31.000, Speaker A: So you were saying earlier that perhaps the end form of this set of products will look something along the lines of Reddit or Quora, but much more, perhaps information dense and easier for people to find the truth about something. And obviously, the current first iteration of the product is chop, which is the quiz game. One actually just random question I had was, how are you guys currently producing all of these questions? Or I guess you guys call them Dex as well, because it feels like a lot of work. But I'm just curious, how are you doing that?
00:33:33.940 - 00:34:48.370, Speaker B: It's a lot of me and a lot of our team. So we have two people helping with questions right now, but it's a lot of us doing it and coming up with the questions, which will change. So we currently allow users to come and ask us questions, but we still moderate them and approve them and go through that kind of stuff. But we're going to start working on a couple of new features for users to actually filter out the questions that they want to see on the platform using the same surprisingly popular mechanic. And so they'll also be able to earn from that and kind of have fun playing the game in slightly different context where they're doing the same things, but deciding what questions that they would want to answer and what questions they think other people would want to answer. The end goal is definitely for this to be like, entirely UGC, where people can come on and make their own decks, whether it's about themselves, whether it's about something that they're interested in, whether it's about. About something that they're doing, whether it's about their friends, you know, whatever.
00:34:48.370 - 00:35:49.820, Speaker B: And that kind of, like, aspect of bringing people together is something that we're really excited about because a lot of the information that we have on people, like people's interests and their reputations, like what kind of topics they are experts in, for example. It's really hard to find people who are like that. It took me a long time in crypto to find people who could understand what I was talking about when I talked about defi stuff and Amm models and interest rates and optimal control and things like that. It would be super cool if there was just somewhere I could go. Here's all these people who have these reputations that are above 70%. I can just go hop in that group chat with them because I also have a reputation above 70%. And now I'm part of this community.
00:35:49.820 - 00:36:01.500, Speaker B: And that's something that we think a lot of this unlocks that we're really excited about. But that's obviously a pretty long ways down the road.
00:36:02.440 - 00:36:40.460, Speaker C: So it sounds a little bit like you are doing prediction markets. In a sense, this could be used to say, predict the election. Maybe you could give us a more concrete compare and contrast against polymarket because we've seen them exploding in recent days. I think they've had some of their biggest uptick in users recently. I guess I just like to understand how this is either similar or different than a farcaster in. Can it be used as an oracle data feed for like, a prediction market? You know, if someone were to compose on top of you or like, how are you thinking about those things?
00:36:41.880 - 00:37:23.678, Speaker B: Yeah, so we are very similar to a prediction market. It's certainly got prediction market elements to it. One of the key, like, legal differences is that we don't give people incentives for, like, the actual outcome of an event. Right. So, like, you're not gambling on whether or not Biden will drop out of the us presidential race. You are revealing, like, the answer and, like, what other people think. So, like, the event itself does not decide whether or not you, like, make money in this, in this situation.
00:37:23.678 - 00:38:14.450, Speaker B: So that's one of the differences. But it is like a social prediction tool. So we are trying to use the wisdom of the crowd the same way that a market does, like a futarchy does, like a poly market does. It's very similar. We're more sentiment and kind of opinion based than a poly market is. So they are the explicitly trying to predict the outcome of the event, whereas what we're trying to predict is how people feel about that event at like a moment in time and use that to predict, like, the Aquaman event. So we actually asked the question, like, will Biden drop out of the us presidential race? And we got it right.
00:38:14.450 - 00:38:40.844, Speaker B: We actually reveal, like, the answer revealed. So it was able to be revealed, like, the day that he dropped out. Really funny, but yeah. So if that answer had been revealed, like, a day before, like, it would have been a prediction. But what that really is, is a snapshot of how people feel at a moment in time. Like the whiff question. Right.
00:38:40.844 - 00:39:12.072, Speaker B: It's not necessarily that people say that the answer is no so that it won't hit $10 billion market cap. It's that right now, the sentiment in this market is that it won't do that in some sort of immediate timeframe. It's less specific and exact, and it gets at more of the context, as I kind of been talking about the other things that are going on, like the emotions of how people, like, feel about it.
00:39:12.216 - 00:39:17.320, Speaker C: And it's like a great index for everything, basically, right?
00:39:17.400 - 00:39:43.584, Speaker B: More or less. And it has a much wider array of market participants. Right. Like, I don't participate in polymarket, for example. Like, I don't really gamble on, like, those kinds of events, but I'm curious what other people think about them. And I want to kind of like, share my opinions on them. And Champa's a way for me, for me to do that and do that without taking excessive financial risk at all and potentially making money on it.
00:39:43.584 - 00:39:53.740, Speaker B: That's not really the reason that I'm doing. I'm interested in the actual answer to the question itself. And then the money is kind of like, oh, a nice thing on top that makes it more fun.
00:39:55.040 - 00:40:08.040, Speaker A: So can you just concretely explain where the financialization is happening here? Is it more so is just potential reward for participating in this process? Obviously, it's not like you're taking on risk like polymarket.
00:40:09.540 - 00:40:39.640, Speaker B: Yeah. So you're basically betting on how good your guess is. So when I reveal an answer, I pay 5000 bonk. And then when that answer is revealed, so there's the first order answer, which is like, yes or no. Does your guess for that match the best answer. If you match the best answer, you immediately get your 5000 bonk back. So you have zero risk if you got the answer right.
00:40:39.640 - 00:41:32.458, Speaker B: And then depending on the second order answer, you have like, say you guessed 75 and the actual average was like 80. So you're like five points away from 80, depending on how distributed all of those second order answers are from like, everybody who answered that question. If you're within the top 50% of like, distances, then you'll get an extra reward. And the closer you are to that 80%, you'll get an exponentially increasing reward, up to 50,000 bunk. Currently it's 10,000. It will be made 50,000 in the next week ish. But that's kind of how it works on the reward stuff.
00:41:32.458 - 00:41:37.178, Speaker B: So you're basically betting on whether or not you guess well, very cool.
00:41:37.234 - 00:41:52.870, Speaker C: So it seems like this would be really, really useful for existing social apps. Just drive their homepages or their content feeds or anything like that. Have you thought about providing this as an oracle for some of those on chain things?
00:41:54.920 - 00:42:35.970, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think, like Oracle, I'm personally concerned about people being like, this is a source of truth. I'm very anal about the best answer, and objectivity is actually subjective. There's this whole other realm of possibility. But yeah, I think that's a, you know, something that we're really trying to explore a lot. We've talked to a few different social applications on how we can help them. Also, like things that you don't necessarily think are like social protocols. Like daos, right? Like the Jup Dao, for example.
00:42:35.970 - 00:43:29.000, Speaker B: Like people are just voting yes on everything because they get paid to do it. So like, why wouldn't they do it? And so, like you can kind of help them filter out for people who read the post and actually, you know, learned what it had to say and, you know, spent 3 seconds thinking about it. Or just be supplementary to, you know, other social protocols, as you're saying, as something that, you know, a poly market could make a market for. Like, what is the outcome of like, like this answer on chomp? And so, yeah, it can definitely be used as like an oracle and composed with. And that's really something that we want to happen.
00:43:29.740 - 00:44:01.190, Speaker A: So throughout this interview you kind of alluded to a few perhaps like economics frameworks or concepts. I'm wondering if you can maybe just walk through anything that you use to inform the building of this. I think you mentioned the keynesian beauty contest was one of them. Just for my curiosity, I would love to just dive into some of these concepts and maybe your listeners would too, because I think these are really at the heart of what's super novel about this, is embedding these primitives into the game itself in order to produce more interesting information.
00:44:03.850 - 00:45:10.282, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a lot of things here generally. Like, I think about this problem in a way that I really don't hear anyone else talking about in the same way. So, like, so I'm in crypto because I have, like, a core fundamental belief that tokens are simply the single greatest opportunity in all of human history to explore large scale coordination mechanisms of human behavior. And that's not how most people think about tokens in general. They're like, oh, like, I'm gonna make this token and distribute it to a bunch of people and we're gonna make a dao. And I don't need to think about, about how it fits into my product because I'll just, like, make it work with, you know, whatever product I end up building. I think, like, token first.
00:45:10.282 - 00:46:09.212, Speaker B: Like, okay, like, how, how do we make an economy that makes a product that people want to consume, that they don't necessarily need to have a blockchain for? Like, my mom can play chomp. My mom plays chomp. She does not know how to use wallet. Like, it's incredible. And so we started with this idea of like, okay, how do we create an economy that produces this kind of, like, information product that we want to see in the world that we think would be helpful, that we personally want to use? And it's very similar to deep in, and it's also similar to how consensus protocols work. You can think of Ethereum. Ethereum's economy incentivizes the builders and the validators and the searchers to build blocks and produce those blocks and validate those blocks.
00:46:09.212 - 00:46:47.540, Speaker B: And Ethereum's product is block space. So Ethereum, through ether, has created the economy to produce their consumable product, which is block space. And in the same way, you should think about designing token economies to create a consumable product. That is something. And in our case, that product is information. And in general, consumer apps are slightly different from your defi protocol or a Dao token. There are specific things that I've thought about a lot for these kinds of apps.
00:46:47.540 - 00:47:32.530, Speaker B: A lot of it is fairly basic economic things that I think people just kind of forgot when we decided we're going to make a new economic regime and a new economic system. For example, everyone makes a capped supply token. Why? Everyone takes the meme from bitcoin of being 21.2 billion tokens and optimizing for being a store of value. And I was like, okay, that's how I'm gonna do it. And they take it from stocks. And they also don't realize that, like, oh, companies can execute stock splits, they can issue more stock that's not a finite real, like a really finite amount of stock.
00:47:32.530 - 00:48:54.364, Speaker B: And so it's not like the same, like, store value kind of, kind of thing. And so then they take it from bitcoin. Okay, but is that the best thing for your economy? Like, is that the best way for you to create an economy that has value flow, that allows the creation of a product? No, it's not. If you go back to the very early Ethereum papers, when Vitalik was just posting on the forums in 2013, he talks a lot about this and a lot about an uncapped money supply and how that makes hard money. Because if you want to create a good economy, and economies are measured in how much value flows through them and how much value that they create, well, you should probably create the medium of value transfer in that economy to be to exist in such a way that it incentivizes for value to flow through that, not for value to stop. And like, that's the uncapped versus cap supply thing. And so, like, there's a lot of things like that that I just don't think people are really thinking about in terms of, like, how do we create the best economy here? And just having, like, that end output in mind.
00:48:54.364 - 00:49:52.050, Speaker B: For us, it's like information. Like, how do we create this economy that has just the best information? And it's mostly simple economic stuff. I don't think any of it is really all that complicated. It's just about how do we solve this problem specifically the best. And I don't think most people in crypto are thinking about the best way to use a token to solve their exact problem. They're taking this blueprint from other places, whether it's a dao, whether it's bitcoin, whether it's ethereum or something else, and slapping a token on top of a product and calling it a day. And I think there's just this whole massively underexplored design space on how to create economies and what kind of positive externalities you can create by just creating some incentives.
00:49:52.050 - 00:49:59.670, Speaker B: And that's really the design ethos with which we create a chomp.
00:50:00.730 - 00:50:24.230, Speaker A: Super interesting. Definitely a lot to think about that, I think is not mainstream, especially for people that are builders. So we obviously covered a lot of topics today. Wanted to kind of close off with what can we look forward to with respect to chomp, what's the easiest way for people to get involved and what's on the horizon?
00:50:25.360 - 00:51:23.950, Speaker B: Yeah, we have a few really exciting things right now. We have meme coin madness with orca. So we have a bracket style tournament going on with 16 different meme coins all pitted against each other. And the winner gets a liquidity pool on orca with some orca token emissions, so some extra rewards there. We're constantly working on stuff on the backend and have a couple new features that are hopefully going to come out over the next couple weeks. And one really exciting mini product, I would call it. That is a new form factor for Chomp that I don't want to spoil the reveal of, but we're very excited about it, so definitely keep an eye out for that and then a couple more features in the pipeline.
00:51:23.950 - 00:52:14.100, Speaker B: Like I mentioned, the filtering for questions and the filtering for tags like the topics of questions as well. And those are the things on the immediate term. Hopefully some more games in the next kind of like year ish. I think we're still working through some of the early bugs and things like that for chomp and figuring out how everything works the best. But definitely want to expand on our game offering for users and that will probably look like the same mechanisms in different ways and also new mechanisms and new games. Yeah.
00:52:15.120 - 00:52:21.320, Speaker C: So it's an iOS app or PWA or how does the user go and start playing?
00:52:21.400 - 00:52:21.784, Speaker A: Yes.
00:52:21.872 - 00:52:39.386, Speaker B: So we have a PWA. You can download the app or play on desktop. Most people definitely play on the Phantom browser. In Phantom, it's just the easiest wallet experience. Yeah.
00:52:39.578 - 00:52:46.554, Speaker A: Well, Isaac, thanks so much for joining us, telling us about Chomp and Gator and love the vision and love what you guys are building.
00:52:46.722 - 00:52:49.050, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you guys for having me on. I really appreciate it.
