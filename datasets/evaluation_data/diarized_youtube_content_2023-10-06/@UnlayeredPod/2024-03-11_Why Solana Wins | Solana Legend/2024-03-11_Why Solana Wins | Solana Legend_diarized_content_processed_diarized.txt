00:00:12.970 - 00:00:14.974, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we.
00:00:15.012 - 00:00:29.334, Speaker B: Explore next generation blockchains. And that's a phrase that was actually coined by today's guest, Solana legend. He's back here for round two. A lot has happened since we last chatted. Markets seemingly have gone parabolic across all.
00:00:29.372 - 00:00:31.766, Speaker A: Ecosystems, and we're excited to chat about.
00:00:31.788 - 00:00:35.640, Speaker B: A bunch of topics today with you. What a legend. Welcome back.
00:00:36.250 - 00:00:39.574, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me on, guys. Excited to be on here.
00:00:39.772 - 00:01:02.080, Speaker B: Excited to have you. I think last time we chatted, we closed off the show, kind of talking a bit about ETH, but perhaps we didn't have enough time to really dive into it. ETH Denver just happened. I just got back from it. A lot of people were there. Let's start with that and maybe even contextualize it in comparison to what's happened on Seoul. What's your kind of 10,000 foot view on what's happening in ETH world?
00:01:03.010 - 00:01:28.730, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So, very interesting conference. It's actually the first time I attend ETH Denver. I didn't go last year. I was pretty surprised, first of all, by the general quality of people. I think Ethereum, despite the trend and everything that's going on, which I'm sure we'll get into, still has some of the smartest developers and researchers in the space. There's no question about it.
00:01:28.730 - 00:02:11.720, Speaker A: The talent is undeniable. But I think, as a general, broad, kind of all encompassing comment, I would say people are not very focused on ethereum main net. Extremely focused on every flavor of restaking. Layer twos, layer three, infra, on infra, on infra. But at this point, I think it was Anatolia who said, layer one isn't for users, it's for block space, and it's for L2s. And I think that that phrase rings 100% true. I mean, being close to the metal at the conference, everyone I talk to is excited about a L2 or some other project, but no one is really talking about ETH main net.
00:02:13.050 - 00:02:22.930, Speaker B: Yeah, no one's really using it either, because it's just so expensive to use these days, I think. David, you say someone was, like, paying $500 in gas recently or some crazy screenshot.
00:02:23.090 - 00:02:47.074, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly $500. But at the same time, to me, I'd feel like most of the activity is on the ether one. That is where the meme coins generally exist. That's where the NFts are. That's where the most liquidity is for the DFI applications. So as much as everyone's excited about the l two s, I do think that single state blockchains do have extremely good product market fit. So I don't know.
00:02:47.112 - 00:02:47.362, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:47.416 - 00:02:52.850, Speaker C: How do you see l two s progressing? And do you actually think that there is going to be a migration this cycle?
00:02:54.390 - 00:04:13.986, Speaker A: I sort of agree with you in the sense that if L2s and the modular world is so if that's the winning view of the world, then why do they keep using ETH main net as the place to launch the biggest meme coin or your project? And I think it's the concentrated liquidity and user activity as well as like the shared state that you mentioned. And really, if you look at the best L2s, in many ways they're going to be used as layer ones. These are pretty much islands that are doing a soft vampire attack on Ethereum layer one or on each other, and trying to attract the most users and developers and TVL that they can. But I think it's just in Cirque contrast with say a salon of the world. In a world where there's different L2s floating around, those are essentially like ledgers floating around in the nether. Sure they're tied with bridges, and people sometimes bridge liquidity back and forth, but by and large I think that's not too dissimilar from for example like in Tradfi, you have like Nizi and Tokyo Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange. You've got these different ledgers and there's a latency and there's arbitrage between them, right? So I think in many ways the kind of modular multi chain world looks a little bit like tradfi in the sense that it's fragmented.
00:04:13.986 - 00:04:47.240, Speaker A: But I think the real magic of blockchains is pretty much everyone being on the same ledger. That's kind of like the name of the game in my view, especially given that these are open source networks where the only real competitive advantage is like the prevalence of state and how many businesses and users tie into that and demand that block space and that shared block space on a daily basis. So I think it's an interesting debate and a fork in the road at this point, but I'm kind of curious to see how it plays out.
00:04:48.970 - 00:05:18.738, Speaker B: Are there any LT ecosystems that you find compelling? Obviously, blast has done pretty well. I would say they kind of proved a lot of people wrong with their whole model for launching, which is basically the exact opposite of what every other l two has done. Obviously Op is really interesting just because what's happening with base. I think roll coin is built on op and seems like they're in some ways anointed, in some sense, a winner. A lot of interesting protocols in arbitrum. I mean, the list goes on. There's a new l two every week.
00:05:18.738 - 00:05:34.440, Speaker B: Does anything stand out to you? I was looking at a chart recently, and it turns out most of them are. It's a pretty even split in terms of revenue and generated by each l two. I haven't seen one kind of emerge from the pack, but maybe there's some other data point that you're looking at.
00:05:35.450 - 00:06:22.738, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, by and large, when people refer to L2s, they're generally talking about EVM L2s. And I think they inherit a lot of the shortcomings of the ETH layer one, right. In terms of not being able to do localized fee markets. And really it's a combination of, like Logan and I talk about this, it's not only how much block space you have, it's also how you're using that block space. And if you're not able to isolate hotspots of activity from an application or a contract that's getting spammed, that's contentious piece of state, then you're biding up the fees for everyone. Right. And I think in many ways, it's kind of like at the point when it inherits a lot of the shortcomings of the layer one doesn't offer a lot of enhancements.
00:06:22.738 - 00:07:27.738, Speaker A: And even if it did, if the optimal L2 looked like Solana, why would you pay for bandwidth twice? Why would you pay for it once at the L2 and once know layer one? So I think that's kind of like we've been a little bit to the end of the road on the discussion. And I think L2s right now are almost a way for people to kind of sweep the problems of the layer one under the rug, go a level higher, and then basically have another fresh round of investments and venture fundable opportunities that they can be early to. And then I can only imagine they're going to do it again with their threes. And now, look, that's not to say there's nothing to learn from these guys, right? I think they're incredibly smart and connected, and their go to market, for example, of blast has been brilliant. The way they've been able to captivate the attention, pretty much the points, farming and deposits, and just the hype around it is very strong, and I think there's no substitute for that. You need to build out the distribution. And even if you have the best product in the world, you need to make people care about it.
00:07:27.738 - 00:08:03.320, Speaker A: You need to get them invested, emotionally invested, financially invested. So I think there's still some good learning lessons around that. But just broadly speaking, we're not necessarily bearish on L2s for the sake of being bearish on them. It's more just like we're bearish on them in their current form and for what they're being used for. If someone brings us a use case or an application that's uniquely enabled by a L2 and it's like an app chain and it just clicks and it just makes sense. We have nothing against it. It's just more like we've kind of yet to see that.
00:08:04.970 - 00:08:39.940, Speaker C: Yeah, I often come back to that as everyone is just raising and launching general purpose L two s. And so they really are just trying to recreate a single state blockchain again, and then trying to create these potentially moats. Generally, they're not very interconnected with other ecosystems. They try and then have their subnets sitting underneath them. So this whole modular thesis, to me, it wears a bit thin when you actually realize that there aren't really actually that many apps being launched on this modular roadmap, as far as I can tell.
00:08:41.750 - 00:08:43.700, Speaker B: Except for the interoperability ones.
00:08:44.070 - 00:08:45.220, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:08:45.590 - 00:08:56.070, Speaker A: They benefit for sure. Right. It's like, bring on the multichain world. There's certainly people that are invested in that future and that stand to gain from it, there's no doubt.
00:08:56.650 - 00:09:42.950, Speaker C: And often people say that the only good use case is probably perps dexes, because you can just sort of use USDC people can come in from any chain. You don't really need great interoperability, sorry, games is probably the other one. But the perps Dexs, which I can think about, which have launched their own app chain, have done so on cosmos at the minute. Maybe Avo, if that's how it's pronounced, is sort of proving this out. But again, I think they're trying to be a general purpose l two. So just everything seems to come back to this idea that if people have tried to move away from, we don't want this monolithic, integrated architecture, and the evidence is proving otherwise, actually, everyone does want everything to be interconnected, all on the same chain, and someone's just trying to come out and become a winner.
00:09:43.610 - 00:10:29.734, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually had a good conversation with a bunch of ETH guys. Some were builders and some were investors. But we were debating, where do you draw the line in terms of ETH alignment? And eventually the answer we came to is, you have to settle to ETH layer one. So the prevalence of EVM was not enough for most of them, they said. Now, with other Da layers, if you don't settle to ETH, you're not ETH aligned. So I think it's an interesting dynamic where people are kind of like raising and they're ETH aligned for as long as they need to be to reach escape velocity and get venture funded. And like I said, escape orbit, and then they're happy to kind of develop their own value.
00:10:29.734 - 00:10:31.320, Speaker A: Cruel story after that.
00:10:34.770 - 00:11:03.400, Speaker B: One question I wanted to bring up is the role of these central driving forces between layer ones. Obviously Tolly for Solana Vitalik, historically for ETH, my sense is that his influence on ETH and its direction has really diminished substantially over the last couple of years. Or mean, are you getting the same read? How do you see that kind of playing out?
00:11:04.170 - 00:11:05.880, Speaker A: Like Vitalik, you mean?
00:11:06.250 - 00:11:08.502, Speaker B: Yeah, Vitalik and ETH.
00:11:08.646 - 00:12:09.914, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think know he birthed the concept in like, push the industry forward leaps and bounds. But I think that the community is pretty divided at this point. There's a lot of people that are in one camp versus another, and what people are seeing really exemplified is the social coordination cost and the social cost of having a modular world where everyone can spin up their own virtual machine. Everyone has a different idea of how blockchain should scale. It's not an overstatement to say if you went around the room in some of these conferences and talked to 20 people, every single person would give you a different answer, a slightly different answer of how they think Ethereum roadmap should be done, or how blockchain should scale. So it's like at some point, the cost of coordinating all these different viewpoints is just so extreme that you can't reconcile all of them into one concise, clear roadmap.
00:12:09.914 - 00:12:56.566, Speaker A: And I think that's one of the things that attracted me so much about Salana initially when I got involved in 2021, was I felt like there was a very clear north star, which was communicated by Tolle as early as like 2018. Basically one synchronized state machine globally, with consensus at the speed of light. And he really hasn't wavered at all. If you go back to early podcasts or your early writings, he's basically been pointed towards that North Star. Exactly. And hasn't really changed now. There's been different approaches and different side quests in terms of having to spend most of 2022 fixing spam and quick and stakewidded Qos and all these different things, localized fees.
00:12:56.566 - 00:13:29.160, Speaker A: But really that was a means to an end that wasn't the end in and of itself. Right. So I think what I applaud about some of these guys like Toli, is just how concise and clear thinkers they are from first principles and then how consistent they've been. They haven't really flip flopped at all. And I think it's not a knock on Ethereum. I just think they're trying to assemble together kind of a Frankenstein monster here of like a jigsaw puzzle, and they're trying to make a bicycle break the sound limit. It's just really hard.
00:13:31.210 - 00:14:06.226, Speaker C: You mentioned earlier that to be ETH aligned, you probably are only just going to have to settle to the ETH L1. What do you think that does to ETH value accrual over time? And there's often this talk about what's going to become commoditized. Often people say Da will be commoditized. And obviously if something's commoditized, that generally means there's lots of different options and you don't really have much pricing power. So tends to be that the price drops down. So people tend to say da. But I mean, I saw a tolly tweet the other day where I think he suggested that settlement as well, he thinks might be commoditized, which I'm not sure if I fully agree with, but yeah.
00:14:06.226 - 00:14:12.142, Speaker C: How do you view ETH value accrual and I suppose just generally value accrual across our ones?
00:14:12.296 - 00:15:29.242, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. I had a pretty long conversation with another asset allocator from Europe about this. I think I kind of view value accrual and tokenomics as kind of like, I go back to my background, economics and business, and in a classical sense, there hasn't really ever been an economy that has achieved long term sustainable growth in aggregate demand with a deflationary currency. It doesn't really work well in practice. So I think many people on the Ethereum side applaud this kind of deflationary narrative, but I think it's very dependent on a couple of things which are not guaranteed in the future, which are MEV revenue and just general usage of layer one. So if you're pushing all the transactions and user bases and liquidity and MEV revenue to the L2 s, and you're batching 100 transactions into one which settles into ether one, it doesn't take a genius to know that your burn is severely decreased. Right? So I think already what we're seeing is a result of all these different L2s taking a lot of the liquidity and revenue away is, I think, really jeopardizing the value cruel story at the base layer.
00:15:29.242 - 00:16:18.890, Speaker A: And I think a lot of people point to Solana and say, hey, Solana is inflationary, but fees on Solana are up by an order of magnitude since November. Dex volumes this morning were higher on Solana than they were on Ethereum. So I think, in a very real sense, you can't build a sustainable economy with a deflationary currency. And I think people are having to go for the value accrual route on ETH because the kind of cheaper, better, faster story is not able to be done by them, like mechanically. Right, with the blockchain. So I think what they're doing is they're having to settle for second best, which is sort of like this deflationary meme, which is powerful. Don't get me wrong, it's gotten some people excited about holding ETH, but it's not very clear.
00:16:18.890 - 00:16:52.278, Speaker A: I've actually gone as far as to say in my conversation last week that at its end, state salana will be more deflationary than Ethereum by probably a substantial margin, just based on usage. There's a lot more value to be had in billions of transactions at a fraction of a penny than there is low millions at ten to $20 or $5100. You're actually a good point.
00:16:52.444 - 00:17:27.700, Speaker B: The usage side, especially on Solana, which to me is happening more organically, it's a bigger market, a lot more retail can engage with it, but also the use cases seem to be more diversified nowadays. You finally have defi happening in terms of just swapping. To your point, it's exceeded Ethereum on many days. This is not a thing that happened on Solana even a year ago. Used to be NFTs that captured speculative primitives. Now it's meme, coins, things like that. Deepen is really big, even like projects that are tapping into the AI space.
00:17:27.700 - 00:17:38.760, Speaker B: More and more of them are coming over to Solana. Let's shift gears a bit and tell me about what you're seeing happening in the Solana ecosystem. What's exciting you these days?
00:17:39.210 - 00:18:40.022, Speaker A: Yeah, so, actually, one of the kind of, like, big journeys that we've been on, actually looking into very closely, is going down the rabbit hole of liquidity. And specifically, we started looking at Dexs and perp dexes, and we found a lot of the issue from first principles was the lack of maker, you know, LPs not being strongly enough incentivized to provide liquidity to a different protocol. Right. So maybe that's an amm. Maybe that's a peer to pool cryptex, similar to GMX, which there are several on salon at this point, like flash trade. So going down that rabbit hole, we realized one of the main reasons why make your liquidity is poor is because a lot of LPs are being adversely selected with toxic order flow. So, in other words, you provide a bunch of capital into a pool, and then you're getting matched with MeV bots and spam, and you're getting picked off, which is unprofitable.
00:18:40.022 - 00:19:35.014, Speaker A: Right. If you look at the earnouts from, say, uniswap of the world, if you take out the incentives and rewards, uniswap LPs are not profitable. So I'll leave you guys to speculate on why people still lp into Uniswap despite losing money. I think there has something to do with their backers and kind of like what Uniswap means to the ecosystem. But I think more generally on Solana, you can do very cool stuff. So, for example, there's a company called Deflow, which has developed essentially decentralized order flow segmentation protocols, where they can assign a toxicity rating to flow, and they can segment kind of pristine human order flow from actual humans doing swaps on a front end from bots and MeV spam. And I think this is really exciting for a number of reasons.
00:19:35.014 - 00:20:34.558, Speaker A: First of all, it enables payment for order flow, which is a very tried and true business model, and something that's absolutely massive in Fredfi with apps like Robinhood. But I think beyond that, it has the potential to boost the profitability of amms by as much as, like 20 or 30 or 40% pretty much overnight by getting routed trades from real humans and then assigning maybe a slight penalty of like, one cent to any transaction from a bot. So I think this is something that Solana uniquely enables. But we're extremely excited for the future of kind of that post fire dancer on chain trading scene, what that looks like in terms of TPS, in terms of low latency. I think the UX of on chain trading is going to be incredible. It's not as going to be as good as a centralized exchange. It's not going to be one Ms because of physical limitations, but it's going to get very close.
00:20:34.558 - 00:20:56.390, Speaker A: And I think if you factor in the fact that there's no KYC and Solana will offer a very seamless trading experience with no downtime with multiple validator clients, I think that end state that deflow is building for, particularly with regards to kind of payment for order flow and order flow segmentation. I think it's going to be absolutely massive.
00:20:59.940 - 00:21:23.880, Speaker C: And I suppose the hottest thing right now in Solana is memecoins. You are obviously a partner at a fund who has LPs. You have to try and outperform the market. How do you think about that? Are you going to them and saying, we need to be allocating to meme coins if we want to try and outperform? Or are you avoiding that conversation and looking elsewhere?
00:21:24.940 - 00:22:39.564, Speaker A: I know some managers definitely have been accumulating them. We're structured much more as a venture fund, so we're not going to be trading actively these sort of things. I think generally the rubric that we have is around, basically, is this asset and is this allocation able to produce venture scale returns? And I think this is a game of risk, how you manage risk taking risk and being able to produce outsized returns. Many times these meme coins or dog coins have produced venture, what would broadly be construed as venture scale returns. But I think the issue is just around the duration of kind of in which time period do they produce that, and do they have the staying power to fit into a two, three, four year portfolio? And I think if we were a liquid fund, it would make more sense. But as a venture fund, it's a little bit hard to justify, but it's very exciting nonetheless. I kind of view dog coins and meme coins as sort of a leading indicator and nothing else, as a vehicle for mass adoption and also kind of a Trojan horse for crypto adoption more broadly.
00:22:39.564 - 00:23:39.490, Speaker A: I think wherever the eyeballs and the attention go first, that's a very good leading indicator as to which ecosystem is going to lead. And I think I even tweeted about this, and I know folks like Anson would agree with me, the fact that Solana has the top meme coins and dog coins this cycle, in terms of bonk, with even stuff like mirror win, and now some of these AI coins like Jensen, I think people are really excited to be trading on Solana, and whether they bridge over to buy some bonk or some wif or whatever that is, this is oftentimes the way people make their first Solana transaction, and they experience a Solana Ux for the first time. So I think it's a very strong indicator that teams and the top devs are choosing to drop on Solana, and they're really capturing a large amount of retail. I mean, if you look at bonkbot volumes, if you look at number of wallets, all these metrics are just up and to the right.
00:23:40.420 - 00:24:21.730, Speaker C: Yeah, because I suppose if you're trying to incentivize people to actually go on chain, you basically need to be offering them the potential to earn a load of money. That's the only real way it's going to happen. And previous cycle, it was sort of, you can, I don't know, go into these super complicated DFI apps and try and re hypothese your stack. And I think it's a bit too much, really, for the average person, whereas I think they will be tempted to come on chain if it gives them the chance of getting 1000 x meme coin. So, I mean, related to meme coins, do you think that this could be a sort of meme coin super cycle, as some people are talking about? Do you think that this could be the result of financial nihilism? As someone else has been tweeting today?
00:24:22.420 - 00:24:23.170, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:23.620 - 00:24:25.520, Speaker C: Do you see this run continuing?
00:24:26.660 - 00:25:25.380, Speaker A: 100% I see it continuing. I actually tweeted the other day that this is perhaps a meme coin cycle, just based on the fact that people like to stay liquid and the potential to, like you said, make life changing money from one small investment or small buy is extremely attractive to most people. I think younger people, generally, my generation, Gen Z and younger, they're not interested in s and p investing. They're just not. This is kind of like the everything bubble thesis that a few various deemed investors have written about, is that basically there's obviously passive flows on Wall street. But in terms of retail, a lot of people would rather not contribute anything to their IRA or 401 and just take their chances in something like the crypto markets. And for a lot of older, more gray haired investors, this seems incredible and they can't believe it.
00:25:25.380 - 00:26:29.412, Speaker A: But I do think it is a new market structure and a new market paradigm that's emerging. And in the same way that many traditional equity managers underperform during the kind of like 2009 to 2020 time frame with big tech just running, people really underestimate these trends in the long run. They overestimate them in the short run, and they underestimate them in the long run. And I think if you look at the long tail of returns and how exponential some of these gains are, humans have a really hard time picturing exponential gains. Like, to use a crude example, if you're a Neanderthal walking through the forest, how do you experience exponential returns or exponential gains? Like, it's mostly linear. Everything in nature is kind of more or less on a bell curve, right? Rainfall, whatever snowfall leaves water in the river, it's all like Gauss's curve. But when do you walking through the woods experience exponential gains? Right? Or exponential returns and the power of compounding.
00:26:29.412 - 00:26:56.850, Speaker A: It's a little bit harder to conceptualize for humans, so many people sell too early. And of course, that's the worst thing you can do when something is growing exponentially. But I think just more broadly speaking, these memes, the ones that have memetic value, a broad cultural appeal beyond just a crypto native sphere, I think these are the ones that have the greatest chance of kind of breaking out into the mainstream and captivating millions of people.
00:26:58.760 - 00:27:30.044, Speaker B: Yeah, that trend you're alluding to, I always refer to it as the rise of yellow capitalism. Yellow capitalists, it's like Gen Z, even Gen Z, Gen Y to a degree. They have a propensity to gravitate towards things like crypto and even like meme coin or meme stocks back in 2021. It's another example where they feel like they're behind financially. They haven't bought a house at 30 yet. They have saddled with a lot more student debt than their parents and grandparents were. And so I completely agree with you on that point.
00:27:30.044 - 00:28:01.690, Speaker B: I think. One question I wanted to, that you mentioned earlier, just how you think about returns as someone on the venture side of investing, is this opportunity going to bring venture scale returns? How do you think about that in the context of today, where we're in this early stage of a bull run? Private valuations have probably gone up a lot, whereas one could conceivably invest in a fair launch token at a lower valuation and to your point, achieve venture scale returns. How does that calculus work in your head? How do you think about all that?
00:28:02.460 - 00:28:38.992, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I think not many investors think on a risk adjusted basis. I think crypto in general is such an aggressive risk asset, that kind of, like old school, sharp ratio school of thinking is not the most appropriate here. It's more like an absolute or total return kind of like framework. So I think just by virtue of investing in crypto, you're taking a lot of risk. It's kind of comical to me sometimes when I talk to people and they say, like, hey, I'm playing it safe. I'm all in on bitcoin.
00:28:38.992 - 00:29:21.564, Speaker A: I'm just like, man, this is a high volatility asset. This is not like real estate or bonds or something else like that. But I think, broadly speaking, people, of course, if you can generate the same returns liquid better, but people are underestimating what's going to happen when I think some of the thesis around high throughput blockchains plays out. And at their end state, how many billions of people are actually going to be using these systems. I genuinely think it's going to be similar to the Internet. Four to 5 billion people around the world will touch a blockchain every day, whether it's directly or indirectly through applications. That's much more likely on their phones.
00:29:21.564 - 00:30:39.556, Speaker A: I think at their end state, next generation blockchains have the potential to onboard literally billions of people. So then you start to think about what does the world look like when all the top consumer apps and tech applications run on crypto rails? Because it's better, it's cheaper, it's faster. And I think this is an end state that we're actively investing for. And I think it's one that people underestimate. On the venture side, there was actually a really good letter written by a very well known VC in silicon valley, and he was basically explaining that AI is not super suitable for early stage venture returns anymore. Basically that the ship is kind of sailed because you have, broadly speaking, huge batches of know founders that are pretty much getting rendered invalidated by one product or feature ship from OpenAI, right? It's like they're shipping one feature and half of YC batches, like bit the dust. So it's such a balance sheet race to get the GPUs and it's such a capital intensive game at this point to acquire data sets, to invest in infrastructure, to hire devs and all these things that it's really not very good for venture.
00:30:39.556 - 00:31:23.720, Speaker A: And he goes on to explain in that letter that he views crypto actually as one of the few unique enclaves that can produce 100 billion dollar disruptor, as he called it. There hasn't been 100 billion dollar company to come out of crypto yet, unless you consider like finance, right, which is like a Web 2.5 company. Essentially they deal in crypto assets, but they don't run the order book on chain. So I think, broadly speaking, crypto is an incredibly exciting area to be investing in, especially throughout the bear market. We saw like VCs say, if you're in crypto, pivot to AI. I think that was the perfect time to ironically pivot away from AI to crypto.
00:31:25.580 - 00:32:43.890, Speaker B: Right, quick follow up there. What about this idea? This is something we actually talked about on a past episode with Tushar when he was on, is the thing about crypto at least the pure play cryptos, right? Like a deep end protocol. Let's take helium, for example, or any of these other guys. By definition, they are a protocol that their exact advantage over the incumbent is that they can kind of take away the rent sicky behavior, make it not free, but like a lot cheaper, maybe one 10th the cost for cell service or whatever product you want to talk about. So doesn't that, by definition, limit kind of how big the company can possibly get? Right, like you're not going to see a trillion dollar company, that's a protocol in crypto, because the whole point of crypto is for decentralizing power and making it a lot cheaper and things like that. So one is, how do you respond to that kind of dynamic that's happening here, where crypto, in a way, makes the thing more free to open and so harder to build a big company? And two, what is your view on just crypto and AI? Do you see anything interesting there? Or to your point, it's like a lot of these AI bets too capital intensive or what have you. But does crypto do anything unique there?
00:32:44.580 - 00:33:38.368, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I think at its core, if AI is an intelligence boom, crypto is a coordination boom. So crypto, what it really excels at, and the true product of crypto, in my kind of view, is coordinating humans capital devices behavior around the world from different parties and agents. And I think the best way and the easiest way that crypto does this is via shared ownership of tokens. Right? So the fastest way to have someone feel invested is to make them own something, right? And I think crypto excels at doing that. In the case of, for example, deepen networks, it's structurally the lowest cost of capital. And Cheyon from Multicoin has done a whole talk on this.
00:33:38.368 - 00:34:45.460, Speaker A: Deepen is structurally the lowest cost of capital to bootstrap a network, to incentivize new supply coming on. And if you look at the alternative, say we had to start a telecom company with an array of telecom towers, which probably is not a good time to do it because there's going to be like low orbit satellite everywhere soon. But I say, hypothetically, we have to do it. How do we compete with at and t? They can issue a $20 billion bond and they basically have an unlimited. They have a low cost of capital, they can borrow public corporate debt, they can access bank debt. They have this deep well of capital markets they can tap. How can we compete with that? And the answer is, with something like deepen, we can be more localized, we can be more tailored, we can be a niche player and essentially incentivize people to do things that are valuable to the network to get a new supply of, say, nodes or a new supply of humans, or doing something that's valuable to the Deepa network to the point that it reaches a critical mass, and suddenly that's profitable for users and kind of the whole flywheel spins.
00:34:45.460 - 00:35:35.012, Speaker A: So I think at its core, Crypto is about coordination. And I think that one of the ways in which crypto and AI kind of best fit together, and I wrote an article about this called Crypto drives an everlasting well of data for AI. You can acquire datasets at a fraction of the cost with tokens than you can say if you're paying dollars or, God forbid, equity or something like that. And I think deep in networks and deepen applications will run on people's phones, and they're going to be massive. I think people all around the world have assets and they're doing things, and they have data sets that are pristine, that haven't been accessed. Like, for example, Reddit's been scraped 100 times, the whole Internet has been scraped 50 times, or whatever. All those data sets are table stakes for these large language models.
00:35:35.012 - 00:36:15.750, Speaker A: What's really valuable is going out there and uncovering these pristine data sets that are wells that haven't been tapped, and the way to actually access those and to be much more targeted and granular is going to have to be with tokens. It's not viable to sell stock and pay people. The cost of capital is just too high. So I think that's kind of in my mind how deep in and AI fit together. But then there's a whole discussion of autonomous agents and the fact that they're not going to be calling Wells Fargo on, like, 02:30 p.m. On a Wednesday. They're going to be reading and writing the blockchains programmatically, hundreds of times per second.
00:36:15.750 - 00:36:17.700, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:17.770 - 00:36:59.652, Speaker B: I'll just summarize what you said, and then Dave will have a question, too. But what you're saying is, it feels to me like there's kind of two avenues to think about crypto and AI. One of them is what you just said, autonomous agents. It's an entity that can now access a wallet and do really interesting things in an automatic way, which is really cool. The other one is there's all this data out there that's completely, like, we don't even realize it's out there. It could be physical data. They could be just silo data organizations or private data on our phones or what have you, that can be used to train models or improve models in a way that's not possible with open data like that's on an Internet, and tokens, the only way to incentivize the sharing of that.
00:36:59.652 - 00:37:04.150, Speaker B: So I completely agree. I think that's like the right framework to think about the intersection of these two.
00:37:09.180 - 00:37:35.760, Speaker C: I suppose the other main vertical, if you like, within crypto times AI is the GPU farms. Basically things like render, where they're collating loads of people's GPUs which are sat at home and helping to fill the supply imbalance that we're experiencing right now. Are you bullish on that? Or is it a case of in a few years, maybe the supply will have caught up with the demand? How are you viewing those projects?
00:37:36.260 - 00:38:22.408, Speaker A: Yeah, so obviously there's a whole host of the projects, right? I think there's like an absolute litany of decentralized compute players at this point. Most of them are focused on imprints as opposed to training of models. So kind of like the daily pings to the model, almost like a Google search, as opposed to initially training the model, which is decentralized compute is not as well suited to train a model. It's much more suited to someone in the Midwest searching up a recipe or whatever. It just pings the model. Actually, most of the revenue around compute is involved with inference, not training. So I think it's an attractive area, definitely an attractive market, but it's a little bit hard at this point to pick a winner.
00:38:22.408 - 00:39:02.824, Speaker A: It's kind of a needle in a haystack situation where a lot of these companies don't even have any contracts. They don't have any mlus, they don't have any fixed take or pay agreements or long term fixed agreements whatsoever. I'd say switching costs remain pretty low. Still, if you have a GPU, you can plug into one program protocol, you can plug into another, one's offering better rewards, you could probably go for that one, right? So I think it's a little bit like DeFi two protocols. Say two borrow lens. One has launched a token and there's no token farming anymore, and the other one is yet to launch one. And it's farming points.
00:39:02.824 - 00:39:57.708, Speaker A: Pretty much capital will leave one and go to the other. So is it kind of like an island hopping of people just chasing rewards? I think that's going to go on for some time, but the real winners will be the ones that are able to build a competitive advantage around. Maybe it's around cost, maybe it's around providers they secure more GPUs, maybe it's around convenience and ease of use. That's something that's big in this day and age, all it's equal. I think people are not willing to pay for a lot of things, but they're definitely willing to pay for convenience and ease of use. So I think really it depends where the basis of competition, how that battlefield emerges. But I think it's going to be a bit of a knife fight because a lot of these protocols have tokens in the hundreds of billions of FTV, and they have basically revenue in the low millions or even not even a million dollars.
00:39:57.708 - 00:40:28.116, Speaker A: So there's a huge mismatch between how these things are getting priced in terms of like, if everything is beta to Nvidia, then nothing is right. And I think that's where people are just taking the trade. It's a crowded trade, I don't blame them. Nvidia's melting faces, it's ripping fine, but at some point there's going to be a collapse and a consolidation of these companies. A lot of them are going to go out of business. So it's not to say that it's not an attractive market. I do think fundamentally it's an interesting market to be investing in.
00:40:28.116 - 00:41:19.220, Speaker A: I just think people should be wary just Max betting on this entire category and just expecting it to run forever. But that being said, the trend, to your question, Dave, is it going to continue? I think it absolutely will. The more sophisticated these LLMs get, the more they're going to be helpful to people, which in turn makes people use them more, which in turn increases demand, which in turn makes them more helpful. So it's like an ascending upward spiral of GPU demand that never stops. I think the demand is going to be ravenous, so we'll see how it goes. I think right now there's a couple of projects that I'm pretty excited about, but just broadly speaking, people have to be a little bit careful. I think not everything's going to be a winner, especially when there's like over 80 of these projects.
00:41:19.880 - 00:41:59.620, Speaker C: And it sort of reminds me of what Sal was saying, that in Web three, a lot of these are protocols effectively, and you don't have that central control, and therefore it's kind of hard to build moats. And that's basically what's happening here, is it's not one entity which owns all of these GPUs, it's everyone owns the GPUs, and then they can do as they wish with them and move them between protocols. So as ever, it sort of comes to. It's really, really hard to build modes maybe on that are there specific areas, moats within crypto that you are bullish on, that you think can really sort of hold out against the competition?
00:42:00.280 - 00:43:23.032, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question, and I think probably the clearest one is the centralized exchange business. Backpack, for example, has achieved a large amount of licenses, retail trading licenses, around the world. We were early investors, and I think people underestimate how difficult that it is, for example, to enable trading in a bunch of US states or to be able to have a fiat on ramp and off ramp in western Europe or in Asia. So I think obviously, regulatory is a strong moat, but I think more broadly, in the tech sense, there's always this debate of, are you building a cathedral or are you building a bazaar? And I think some people subscribe to this idea that basically the best web two applications, and Christixon writes about this in his new book as well, the best web two applications feel like a little bit like Web one. They're almost like a portal into a more free and open and permissionless Internet, right? In the sense that Patreon allows you to regain ownership of your audiences and how you monetize them and how you interact with them, versus, like, a YouTube, which is an archetype of web two, censorship. And it's a platform where you can invest 100,000 hours and it can be taken from you like this. They actually control how your videos are monetized.
00:43:23.032 - 00:44:26.740, Speaker A: They control what you can talk about, what you can't. So I think really the most interesting aspect of crypto for me is a return to almost like the web one. Principles of a free and open Internet, and crypto being kind of the economic value transfer layer for that. Right? So if you could do calls over voice over Internet protocol, then crypto is like money over Internet protocol, and it allows the transfer of economic value in ways that have really not been possible before. So I think really, the mode that companies build, a strong mode, is distribution, and another one is around what kind of user experience, an emergent user experience can you offer. Does this feel free? Does it feel fresh? Does it feel exciting to use? I think that's very good if it feels like another version of a web two app, but it's running on crypto rails. That's a bit of a robotic horse when cars exist, in my opinion.
00:44:27.320 - 00:44:44.728, Speaker B: So this is a point that I think has been communicated by lots of people in web3, whether it's builders, investors, thought leaders and blogs. So to me, not to introduce too much spice here, but I just feel.
00:44:44.734 - 00:44:45.770, Speaker A: Like this is.
00:44:47.740 - 00:45:06.320, Speaker B: It hasn't really played out, and there's no evidence that it ever will. At least you bring up Patreon. Like, Patreon's great, but they're kind of irrelevant. I don't really use it every day. Most people don't use it. YouTube has changed many people's lives. Whether it's creators, it's created entire celebrities, billion dollar businesses are built on YouTube like feastables.
00:45:06.320 - 00:45:55.230, Speaker B: That's something I use every single day. And so the question to me becomes, is it human nature to just, like, aggregation layers to, like, one body kind of pulling a lot of other people together, centralizing it and creating some standards? Is it possible really to decentralize it? Because to your point, like web one was really chaotic. You had forums with all these random people making content, and there's no standards being adhered to. Even MySpace, the joke was everyone has a different looking page because there's no standard template and everything kind of looks like fake person or grift or what have you, whatever you want to call it. Wasn't until Facebook came around that social media had billions and billions of users worldwide. So how do you reconcile that? How do you reconcile history versus what crypto aspires to be?
00:45:55.680 - 00:46:27.624, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great point. And I think really there's a difference between the front end and what people can touch and feel versus what's happening on the back end. And I think people like centralized touch points. They like to go to one place where all the noteworthy content is. Right. And it's the main reason why, for example, there's a huge amount of people, billions of people every day, that talk to each other via Instagram, DMs, as opposed to text. Because if you're just texting someone, you have to actually have something to say to them.
00:46:27.624 - 00:47:26.760, Speaker A: You have to ask them like, hey, what did you eat for breakfast? Or whatever? Have you gone to your doctor's appointment? Whereas you can go on Instagram and there's already noteworthy content to talk about, there's discoverability, and you can send someone a meme and say, hey, did you see this? It's funny. So I think people kind of gravitated towards wherever the content is, to your point. But I think you can achieve that in a kind of like a centralized front end, but you can give people ownership of the different pieces of data and kind of the content itself on the back end. And I think the Internet excels at disseminating massive amounts of information. What the Internet is really bad at is saying who owns what? And that's what tokenization solves uniquely. So I think this is where you could have a front end where you can see all the world's information or the front page of the Internet, or whatever you want to call it. But then you could assign little flags to different blobs of data and really have this be tokenized.
00:47:26.760 - 00:48:00.310, Speaker A: And I think in general, for example, nfts for me, end up being like NFTs to content, almost end up being like MP3 to music. People just adopt it as a standard and then eventually you don't call music MP3 s or videos MP4, it's just content. In the same way that tech, at one point, Internet companies were distinct from technology, and then Internet companies moved into the cultural fold of the zeitgeist. Right. And I think crypto and Web three will move into the fold of what's broadly considered tech as well.
00:48:00.940 - 00:48:44.228, Speaker C: Yeah, I love that answer. I just wanted to come back to something you said earlier where you were talking about, I think it was a Silicon Valley VC saying that crypto basically is one of the last bastions of places where you can get outsized 10,000 x returns, or whatever it may be. I kind of feel that currently the matter is that it's only really in the private realms where a lot of that exposure is possible. And that's in large part post ICOs. It's in large part because of the regulations and fear of regulation, basically from the projects. And a lot of people say that every new bull market is started because of new ways of capital formation. I think it's too shar from multicoin that has popularized that.
00:48:44.228 - 00:49:26.980, Speaker C: But actually, I don't know if it's quite right. I feel like it's actually the bull markets are created by ways in which normal people can get into things early, because that was nfts. You didn't have VCs buying into NFTs. I think that's meme coins, I think that's liquidity mining, all these things where you can actually get in the first step. So I suppose my question to you is, do you think that it's maybe skewed too far that vcs maybe have too much early access to these projects? And would you like to see the return of something like ICOs or some other way to allow people? I suppose airdrops is another way that people are getting in the ground floor, but a way that they can actually invest early on rather than being airdrop something when it's already at 5 billion valuation.
00:49:27.800 - 00:50:34.640, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. And it also gets into how you bootstrap a community, right? And I think even for layer ones or L2s, there's a unique challenge today where back in the day, you could buy Salana at 100 million dollar market cap, like on public markets. And if Salana was a company with common equity, there's no way a public market participant could gain access to buy a coin of Salana or share or whatever that early. Just a common person with an Internet connection. Like if you're connected enough and know what you're doing, you could literally buy a salon at 100 million with a Lenovo laptop from 2010 and a broadband Internet in the middle of Kazakhstan. That's a level of democratization that has never existed, ever in the course of human history. And I think it's precisely because, it's precisely because crypto trades in public markets at a very early stage of its life cycle.
00:50:34.640 - 00:51:21.960, Speaker A: These are companies, they would definitely not be able, you wouldn't be able to buy them until they were public, which would be much later, like series C and beyond. So I think that has a very special effect of essentially opening up these venture scale returns to public market participants all over the world in a permissionless manner. And I think it really gives access to a lot of people to kind of sorts of investments that they would never have hope or a chance in high hell of ever investing in. So I think it's very powerful. But to answer your question directly, I think in some ways we're having a return to kind of more of like the ICO and fair launch approach. I think it's the most equitable. I think it's the one that gives, in many ways, the protocols themselves the best outcome as well.
00:51:21.960 - 00:52:30.748, Speaker A: Obviously, if someone could buy ETH ICO, that's the best scenario for them personally. But I think what people underestimate and underrate about ICOs was the effect they had on community building and for the protocols themselves and for the blockchains, when you can make a large amount of people life changing money, I think people really underestimate the effect that that has on an ecosystem. And conversely, when you open a new layer, one at five to 7 billion FTV, or 10 billion, as I'm hearing now, what does that have to do? What effect does that have on crypto native retail? Right, okay, sure, you can give them an airdrop, fine. It's never going to be as good as being able to buy this at a few cents a coin. So I think in many ways, protocol founders need to be very cognizant of the trade offs that they're making. By opening at such a large FTV, your early investors are going to be happy. But in many ways, you're perhaps shooting yourself in the foot, because in many ways, opening at a lower FTV is sort of taking a step back to take three steps forward.
00:52:30.748 - 00:53:15.390, Speaker A: You have that social air, you have that early group of evangelists, guys that will support every protocol. They'll provide liquidity and TVL into the defi apps, they'll sweep your NFTs. They'll mentor and advise your founders free of charge because they're already very highly invested in the success and future of the ecosystem. And I think this is what's gone remiss. And what people often, who haven't been very early to a blockchain, they don't realize the effect, for example, that the Ethereum ICO investors had on evangelizing the chain. Or for example, early Solana participants like myself, like folks that probably wouldn't be on this call if they weren't given the opportunity to buy Solana under five months.
00:53:21.040 - 00:54:00.664, Speaker B: Can you talk to us a bit about. So I completely resonate with a lot of what you're saying. I think it makes complete sense now. In reality, what I'm seeing or hearing about through the grapevine is we're in this part of the cycle now where you have all these infra projects that are just raising at hundreds of millions of dollars FTV, if not more, some in the billion dollar territory. And the funny part is, investors love it and they'll eat it up just because these things can get bid to double digit billion FTVs. And this kind of infra phenomenon that does not exist in any other industry. I've never seen anything like it.
00:54:00.664 - 00:54:30.052, Speaker B: Only in our industry self perpetuates. You build infra that touches other infra and it kind of all rehypothecates into itself. And these things just get crazy high. I mean, what's your reaction to that phenomenon historically? I think when we had Kyle on this show in the summer, he said the ratio between infrared deals versus consumer is six to one. Something like that, which I don't find surprising at all. And I think that number makes ton of sense. I'm not sure that number is ever going to change.
00:54:30.052 - 00:54:43.370, Speaker B: Maybe it'll actually go even more skewed towards infra. What's your reaction to all of that that's happening in spite of what we just talked about with respect to people getting in early on some of these deals and kind of evangelizing early on?
00:54:44.220 - 00:55:13.952, Speaker A: I think, first of all, it's a great question. And it's one that pretty much we've sort of set up the fund to take advantage of this dynamic where 90% of venture dollars in the space have gone to the EVM ecosystem. Like EVM landscape, broadly speaking. Right. ETH layer one, L2 s, or like adjacent infrastructure. I think infrastructure is overbid in many ways, because it's the kind of like high risk, sorry, or high reward, low risk. It's viewed that way.
00:55:13.952 - 00:55:48.076, Speaker A: Whether it is actually depends on who you talk to or looking at the numbers. But I think, broadly speaking, when people zig, you have to zag. If you want to produce outsized returns and you have to be contrarian, you have to be right, you have to be early. So in many ways, there's a dynamic now where people are max biding infrastructure rounds. They're funding them, because you don't need product market fit to pretty much, you don't have to come face to face with your failures as infrastructure project because you're building infrastructure. Right. That's for the applications to worry about.
00:55:48.076 - 00:56:41.500, Speaker A: They can come on top and they have to deal with Daus and Maus. If you're infrastructure, all you have to do is build a narrative and say, hey, this can be user X, Y and Z. And then basically by choosing the category and which game you're playing, you can gain a higher valuation. But I think at some point, what's actually going to happen is that, and maybe this is already happening slightly, way too many dollars are going into infrastructure, and then there's a profound underinvestment in applications. So what does that mean? That means the applications that are standout, that actually can go the distance, that are built on the right stack, like Solana, that are performant, that can actually serve millions or even billions of people one day, are super undervalued because there's less dollars chasing the same deals. And I think a great example of this is tensor blur raised at 100 million, tensor raised at ten. So that's ten times upside for your limited partners for the same deal.
00:56:41.500 - 00:57:30.860, Speaker A: I'd say team is just as talented in tensor, if not more and addressable market. It's the same or larger on a chain like Salana than it is on Ethereum. So really it's a question of what kind of upside are you looking for? And I think towards the end of this bull market, I firmly believe there's going to be new L2s, new layer ones, restaking layers, all these different things that are not able to get a term sheet, they're not able to get funded. And I think that's going to mark the end of the infrastructure build out phase. And people are actually at some point categorically not going to invest in EVM based technologies because the performance is so much higher, say on a Solana or Sui or monad of the world at least like low performance EVM. Right. So I think that's an end state we're rapidly progressing towards.
00:57:30.860 - 00:57:44.000, Speaker A: And I think just by being contrarian, doing analysis from first principles, trying to see where value is going to accrue, and taking a different approach to most of the herd, this is how you can actually outperform by a substantial margin.
00:57:44.580 - 00:57:54.836, Speaker C: How do vcs continue to do this over and over again? Not you guys, but traditional VCs. The volumes have absolutely fallen off a cliff during the bear market, and now.
00:57:54.858 - 00:57:55.424, Speaker A: We'Re in a bull.
00:57:55.472 - 00:58:12.970, Speaker C: When if you're investing now, firstly you're going to be at higher valuations, but also you've probably got a couple of years until you're actually going to be able to sell anything, by which point it's probably going to be a bear market again. So how do they keep getting it wrong? What structurally was different? I suppose with normal VCs, that wasn't the case with you guys.
00:58:14.460 - 00:58:44.196, Speaker A: Well, I think there's a lot of folks that are managing large funds, and I'm not singling out anyone here, by the way, just a broad comment. And this is true of like hedge fund managers and people in Tradfi as well, and traditional tech. A lot of people are working for the 2%, not for the 20. They're in the asset management game. They're trying to increase the amount of money that they manage and the incentive to really outperform goes down. Same. You have a 400 million dollar fund and you charge 2%.
00:58:44.196 - 00:59:24.640, Speaker A: Like you're making $8 million a year to essentially wake up in the morning and make toast and have coffee, you know what I mean? Of course you have to hire a team. It's not all just going to your pocket, but for small fund managers, we eat what we kill. We're out here to outperform, to make a name for ourselves. We can make, quite frankly, a lot more money working for someone else from a salary and income basis. It's much more about proving that we have the access, proving that we can manage risk, proving that we can be good stewards of other people's money and manage the book prudently. And I think that's kind of like the difference. And that's why there's a lot of alpha decay.
00:59:24.640 - 01:00:05.596, Speaker A: As funds get larger, they just underperform. And maybe that's to do with also the fact that series A and beyond is just not as robust as precede and seed in crypto. And the Series B market is notoriously bad. Maybe this is just a lack of maturity, or maybe there's just not enough follow on. Maybe the time to liquidity in these projects is so fast, by the time series B comes around, your precede and seed investors have sold their tokens or OTC them or whatever. So the incentive to continue helping the project is no longer there. Whereas in tradfi you're locked in a lot of those investors, they are not seeing a dollar until IPO, right?
01:00:05.778 - 01:00:43.176, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a weird phenomenon that you just described that's unique to crypto, just given the opportunity for early liquidity through the token. I think the moment when a 16 Z invested in eigen layer, $100 million, that was kind of a great litmus test for where we're at in terms of the fundraising landscape and kind of the reason why I asked that whole question about infra, because I just feel like, all right, here we go again. We're going to run this playbook back. Not to say anything bad. I mean, Eigen layer seems like a good project. One topic I wanted to kind of touch on and maybe close out on is just what's happening in this world of bitcoin. At the start of the year, ordinals came out.
01:00:43.176 - 01:01:20.730, Speaker B: A lot of people thought it was just hot gas and nothing would come of it. Here we are a year later and should change. And it seems like that it's thriving in a way that I never predicted. I just did some crunch, some data the other day, and Magic Eden actually was number one across all NFT marketplaces in terms of pure volume, purely because 80% of their transaction volume is from ordinals, which is pretty insane. On the one hand, they seemingly have executed the first kind of big company to execute a multi chain strategy, 80 20 bitcoin to Salana, NFT trading volume. But I mean, this bigger trend we're seeing now, ordinals aren't going away.
01:01:21.500 - 01:01:23.320, Speaker A: They have PMF, clearly.
01:01:23.740 - 01:01:35.950, Speaker B: I believe something like node monkeys will flip crypto punks in terms of floor price, and I think maybe multiple bitcoin ordinals will do that. What's been kind of your response to what you've seen on the bitcoin side?
01:01:37.040 - 01:02:12.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in many cases the next big thing starts out looking like a toy. Right. And I think that's a great article by Chris Dixon as well. I think people really underestimate a small reframing or a small recategorization of something that we're somewhat familiar with. It wasn't just nfts on bitcoin. It was a more profound shift than that. It was the fact that people, for the first time could do something with their bitcoin that wasn't just like stack Sats and throw some laser eyes and go on Twitter and tell people to do the same.
01:02:12.090 - 01:02:42.892, Speaker A: For the first time in history, people could use their bitcoin. They could buy bitcoin assets. They could buy assets that were denominated in bitcoin natively, right? They could help secure the network and paying higher fees. Suddenly miners are more profitable. And suddenly ordinals began to get inscribed on rare sets. I remember I talked with CK Shark, the founder of ordinal Maxi business at NftNYC last year, and he told me, legend. I'm inscribing one of the first PFPs on rare sats.
01:02:42.892 - 01:03:22.748, Speaker A: And I'm going to be honest, guys, I kind of fade it. That's a very costly. It's a multi million dollar mistake on my part. But I think it's an important lesson to learn that when there's a new dynamic emerging, right? And something like rare Sats helping miners be more profitable, like rare and uncommon SATs are now being sold by the person who mines the block and it supplements their operating income as business. That's pretty cool because the block rewards are getting halved, obviously, in a few weeks or a couple of months, like one month. So this is helping secure the network. But I think it's a new paradigm and I think ordinals were just the new thing back then and the first thing.
01:03:22.748 - 01:03:48.352, Speaker A: But now there's BRC 20s, which are doing insane volume. I don't know if you guys have been seeing, for example, Ordi doing 100 X, the volume of the entire salana NFT ecosystem. One asset, right? One asset. So players like OKX are leaning into this as a kind of a fulcrum to gain market share on finance. They're saying, we were earlier to BRC 20s. Maybe finance faded, missed a little bit. It's an important new battlefield that's emerged.
01:03:48.352 - 01:04:27.596, Speaker A: And now with BRC twenty s and the next iteration, runes R six, all these different things, it's only going to go further. I think bitcoin DFI is still in the very early innings. And the profound amount of liquidity that exists on bitcoin cannot be understated like, it is quite literally one or two orders of magnitude larger than Ethereum, which in turn is one or two orders of magnitude larger than Solana. So it's like very large amount of capital waiting. And I think, frankly, there's going to be cool opportunities there. The issue is that for me, it's kind of like a better version of ETH. You're still not going to have global infrastructure, global businesses running on bitcoin.
01:04:27.596 - 01:04:38.788, Speaker A: You just can't. It's just not possible. It's like dial up. You can have the best on dial up. It can be the coolest, it can be the most OG. Whatever, fine. People have fun with that.
01:04:38.788 - 01:05:13.612, Speaker A: There's still guys on Wall street running 2001 excel. They're used to doing vlookups and hlookups. They don't want to update their computer. Fine. Some people stay on bitcoin, some people stay on Ethereum. But my point is, for me, kind of like bitcoin is like a better version of ETH at this point, unfortunately. So Ethereum's rock in a hard place where it's getting squeezed from high throughput blockchains like Salana that are better, pure infrastructure, better, pure smart contract platforms on one side, and they're getting also squeezed by L2s on that side and then on the other side at kind of these crypto native ponzies.
01:05:13.612 - 01:05:16.688, Speaker A: Bitcoin is going to just dominate, to be honest. Right.
01:05:16.774 - 01:05:26.704, Speaker B: The more sound money, right? No one can do ultrasound money better than bitcoin. We said this in last week's pod. It's like this barbells forming around, like, high throughput Solana bitcoin.
01:05:26.832 - 01:05:28.132, Speaker A: He's kind of in the middle where.
01:05:28.186 - 01:05:48.620, Speaker B: If you're someone new, why would you enter there? But are you saying that. I understand ordinals is very much a phenomenon in the APEC region? Are you saying that it's possible ornales or BRC 20 or what have you, phenomenon comes to the west as well? Or do you think they're going to more so gravitate towards things like Salana?
01:05:48.960 - 01:06:24.984, Speaker A: I think it could come to the west, definitely. Still, the vast majority of volumes, even, like these recent sweeps of node monkeys and stuff, are all coming from Asia. But I think what's more interesting for Salana and Ethereum is a 404 scene. I think that's going to be absolutely massive. I think that is the thing that will bring back nfts. Like, if I have to go on record on this podcast, go out on one thing. I think 404s are going to unlock new use cases and new businesses for NFTs that have never been seen before.
01:06:24.984 - 01:07:12.004, Speaker A: I think just the ability to list an NFT collection on binance or on a centralized exchange as a token that's fungible is massive, and it creates kind of this funnel where, broadly speaking in crypto, there's two camps of people, people that like fungibles and people that like non fungibles. And for the first time, you're uniting both of them under the same hut. And if the token gets bid, NFTs can get arbed up. And if the NFTs get swept, the token can get arbed to a midpoint as well. So it catches both sides of the spectrum. And I think you have a situation where hybrids, even OG collections like board apes, are going to be hybridized into fungibles and tokens are catching a bid. They're the only thing people are buying.
01:07:12.004 - 01:07:17.080, Speaker A: Okay, cool, what's the solution? JPegs become tokens and vice versa.
01:07:17.900 - 01:07:52.048, Speaker C: Yeah, I do love that, because at the moment it's like NFTs are just inferior to meme coins. At the moment, you're not going to get 100 x on an NFT anymore. You could have maybe last cycle it was definitely possible, but now there's just not enough interest, there's not enough supply on them. It's too much friction. People don't have enough money to buy that NFT. Whereas if you can do meme coins with NFTs, so you can have, especially if they're different NFTs that can be created from a particular meme coin collection, then it's just like a better version of a meme coin. So it goes from being like a worse version of a meme coin to like a better version of meme Coin.
01:07:52.048 - 01:08:31.824, Speaker C: So I do really like that take. Maybe just the final question. But bitcoin ETF, we're seeing a huge amount of volume coming in, and it's really driving the price, hopefully going to be all time high soon. You mentioned Ethereum struggling with its narrative. Maybe ETF could be that narrative smaller asset if it's going to be seeing anywhere near the amount of inflows that bitcoin has been seeing. And also, I feel like the tradfi boomers normies, they don't really understand what's going on. I just watched some horrendous clip on CNBC or something like that, and they don't have a clue what they're talking about, and they're not going to care that Ethereum is not as good an infrastructure layer as Solana because they don't know anything in the first place.
01:08:31.824 - 01:08:38.390, Speaker C: So can etfs save it? How much ETF is going to dominate, control this market?
01:08:39.880 - 01:09:29.856, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think, first of all, with the bitcoin ETF, it introduces an interesting dynamic where I was talking about passive flows earlier on Wall street, and the fact that so many people are buying the spy, and it's a cap weighted index. So that causes a disproportionate amount of capital to go to the largest companies in the space. The bigger get bigger, basically. And this has happened with big tech and fang companies back for the last decade. But I think it creates somewhat of an interesting dynamic with bitcoin, where I think bitcoin dominance could go higher than ever before structurally, because there's so many people that are just like, hey, I want to invest in crypto. Before they had to pretty much go and go on Coinbase, get down and dirty off ramp to a noncustodial wallet, kind of figure it out on chain.
01:09:29.856 - 01:10:13.788, Speaker A: Now they can just bid ibit. So it's kind of like maybe creates a situation where bitcoin dominance goes higher than before. But I do think the bid is like sneaky strong in terms of the amount of inflows that are going to happen. Because the way large asset managers are thinking about this, it's not on price per coin or valuation, they're not valuation sensitive. These people are thinking about allocations, percentages of allocation, one to 3% for bitcoin, and they're going to accumulate one to 3% of the portfolio in bitcoin. Whether it's 63,000 a coin, 89,000 a coin, 220,000 a coin, they're going to just accumulate it. The way the game theory works with the Nash equilibrium is that the best time to be buying bitcoin was yesterday.
01:10:13.788 - 01:10:54.028, Speaker A: So basically, buy as much as you can buy before your friends. And that's just the way, kind of like, I think we're going to go into a bit of an spending arms race, so to speak. But in terms of the broader ETF narrative, I do think an Ethereum ETF gets approved. I do think eventually a Solana ETF will happen as well. It's not a question of if, it's when. I think these guys make money on AOM and they want to offer a large menu of ETFs. So I don't know if that's enough to save Ethereum, to be honest, to be completely honest guys, if that's the best thing Ethereum has to look forward to as an ETF they're in a bad place.
01:10:54.028 - 01:11:28.980, Speaker A: They're in a very bad place because that's something you can't control. And frankly, it's not enabling delightful experiences on chain. And I've talked to Armani about this as well. He always says the best thing is when people are innovating and they're enabling new and delightful experiences on chain. Stuff like ordinals, stuff like 404, stuff like just trading on Salana. I think it's great. So, broadly speaking, public market passive inflows into bitcoin and then crypto natives, of course, we're on our own planet.
01:11:28.980 - 01:11:30.600, Speaker A: Just Max degenning.
01:11:33.680 - 01:11:43.390, Speaker B: Amazing. Look, we covered a lot of ground on this episode. Any kind of closing thoughts or topics you want to touch on?
01:11:45.220 - 01:12:04.084, Speaker A: No, I'm really excited. I think we're kind of going into the jaws of what looks to be a pretty insane bull market. Retail is showing up, but pretty recently, I think institutions have been pretty much leading this one. Finally, the narrative of, like, institutions are coming is actually playing out.
01:12:04.122 - 01:12:04.950, Speaker B: That's fun.
01:12:05.320 - 01:12:33.710, Speaker A: So I'm pretty excited for the whole asset class to increase. And I think one thing that I've been thinking about a lot, and I'll kind of leave you guys to think about this and maybe you don't have to answer, is kind of like, if we're sitting at, I don't know, 2.5 or maybe, I think it's like 2.7 trillion market cap today, and we're going to go to ten. Bitcoin is going to be maybe three or four. What's the other six or seven?
01:12:36.420 - 01:12:37.904, Speaker B: Very good question.
01:12:38.022 - 01:12:40.770, Speaker A: Good to think about 100%.
01:12:41.780 - 01:12:57.984, Speaker B: We'll definitely ruminate on that. But, yeah, I love it. And yeah, you're right. Institutions are coming. That's a meme I saw back in 20, 17, 18, rather, after all the bags went down. So it's good to feel just to see that materialize, finally. Well, Mr.
01:12:57.984 - 01:13:05.370, Speaker B: Legend, always great to have you on the show. Really appreciate you taking the time in this very hectic season we're in.
01:13:05.980 - 01:13:06.392, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:13:06.446 - 01:13:10.596, Speaker B: Looking forward to your future tweets and investments.
01:13:10.788 - 01:13:12.710, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for having me on.
