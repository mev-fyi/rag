00:00:14.240 - 00:00:56.566, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we talk about next generation blockchains. I'm your host, Saul, and today I'm joined by my former colleague, Lucas Cheyenne. Lucas is a researcher at Galaxy Digital. He broadly covers Solana, but most recently has gained some notoriety, I guess, for writing a really good paper on AI. It's called understanding the intersection of crypto and AI, and we're going to chat about all that. Lucas has pretty broad background. He's spent a lot of time in China focusing foreign policy and has a finance background, but these days is really deep in the trenches in crypto, and so we're super excited to kind of chop it up today.
00:00:56.566 - 00:00:59.034, Speaker A: Lucas, how's it going? Good, salt.
00:00:59.074 - 00:01:03.746, Speaker B: Great to see you and thanks for having me on. It's always been a dream to be on unlayered.
00:01:03.930 - 00:01:46.914, Speaker A: I appreciate that. Yeah, no, it's great. I feel like I see you at quite a few events just around the city, too, but it's always good to catch up and just talk about what you've been writing about, thinking about. Maybe it would be helpful for our listeners to understand, because obviously, I think one thing that's clear, and you're seeing it a lot in crypto Twitter, is this notion of crypto and AI and these projects being kind of one of the biggest narratives coming out of this cycle that we're in. A lot of the top performers are in that space. What did you try to focus on when you wrote this paper? Understanding intersection of crypto and AI?
00:01:47.374 - 00:02:42.284, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I think that framing is great because I really started looking into this last July, and at the time, the narrative for crypto and AI was really starting to pick up steam. And as is usually the case in crypto, theres a huge difference between the noise and the actual signal of what was happening. And so my goal at the time was really to dive into, all right, if crypto and AI is going to happen, why would it happen? And where are we seeing the intersections today in terms of the actual tech on? So in my report, I really break it out into three different layers. I think the first layer that we're seeing is really this hardware layer. A lot of people, and if you follow crypto, you've heard of these applications and protocols. What they're really doing is they're just providing the base hardware, whether it's memory storage, GPU's, so that these AI processes and workflows can actually run on chain.
00:02:42.284 - 00:03:06.256, Speaker B: And I think it's probably the most oversaturated kind of sector of the AI crypto space right now, but it's also a really critical one, given shortages and chips, some of the stuff that's happening on the regulatory front. So there is, like, real reasons for why these products might be used, but there's definitely maybe a little bit of oversupply right now in terms of the number of protocols building in that space.
00:03:06.400 - 00:03:11.408, Speaker A: And can you give us just a few quick examples just to anchor us on different projects there?
00:03:11.576 - 00:04:13.872, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So the most basic way to think about it is if you are training or running an inference, like querying chat GPT on the backend. Once you do that, you have a GPU that's actually running the processes and giving you the output. Right now, what we're seeing is very large AI companies like OpenAI are just buying as many GPU's as they can, because to train these models is incredibly expensive and requires a lot of GPU's, especially if you want to do it fast. And so we've seen a bunch of these kind of two side marketplaces launch up, where basically what they do is they allow anybody with a GPU to provide somebody who wants to rent that GPU, or to rent that GPU to somebody who wants to. So the idea is you have all these gamers, or maybe you have old crypto miners that used to mine Ethereum on Asics, and they have all this, like, mid tier GPU supply that is kind of locked up. And so as we continue to see demand for AI processes increase, the idea is GPU, the demand for GPU will increase.
00:04:13.872 - 00:05:06.120, Speaker B: And these centralized providers that we see today are probably not going to be able to meet all that supply. And there's also a question of whether they should be providing all that supply. Shouldn't there be other permissionless, trustless options to get access to this type of GPU? So the OpenAI, I think, debacle last fall, and then we also saw an executive order come out of the White House talking about regulation on AI. I think that's really spurred a lot of introspection and thinking, both by people who are already building in this space, but also by outside AI, people who work at OpenAI and stuff, thinking, all right, if we're gonna create a more decentralized version of AI so that we don't have to worry about centralization factors or about one company owning the best model, how can we do that? And I think the first thing that usually jumps to people's mind is decentralized compute marketplaces, for sure.
00:05:06.192 - 00:05:27.184, Speaker A: And in projects in this space, I'm just looking at your market map here, like Nasana IO.net comma render Akash. These are the names I've heard talked about the most with respect to crypto and AI, I guess, aside from bittencer, which we'll get into what they do as well. Okay, and then you said there's another category you're getting into the next.
00:05:27.224 - 00:05:59.104, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So once you have the hardware, then the question is, how do you actually run AI processes on chain? Because blockchains are compute constrained and AI is resource intensive. And so you really need to reconcile those two differences. And there's a new set of, I would call them like people are calling them connective tissue layers almost. I think that's a good way of thinking about it. And basically what they're doing is they're reconciling those two differences. So they're allowing you to run the compute off chain.
00:05:59.104 - 00:06:59.196, Speaker B: So for example, run an inference, or chain a model using GPU's and then post back onto chain a proof verifying that the person who said they trained that model did it the way did it with the model they said they would or with the data that they said they would. So it's really a way of making sure that you can have access to unlimited computer while also being able to prove on chain that you did nothing malicious or nefarious. One of the biggest areas we're seeing this development happen in is something called zero knowledge machine learning, ZKML. And that's just using zero knowledge proofs basically, in order to facilitate that process. We're also seeing a lot of things called co processors kind of pop up. And that's basically instead of just providing you like the actual proof, um, format or framework, it's like adding an actual, like an actual workflow. So that if you don't have much experience like generating those or coding of that, you can just kind of like plug into it and use the process itself.
00:06:59.196 - 00:07:31.400, Speaker B: So, um, I think like Ezekiel and modulus labs are like definitely two of the leaders in the ZKML space in terms of the actual like tech of the zero knowledge side. And then I think we're seeing companies like ritual. Allora. There's a lot I would even, maybe even put bitten, sir, into this category that are doing the more full service. You just need to plug into our software and we handle all the backend. And you can now run inference, you can run compute, you can do any sort of AI workflow that you want. So that gives us the hardware to run these processes.
00:07:31.400 - 00:08:27.464, Speaker B: We now have this connective tissue to bring AI workflows on chain. And then you finally need a consumer of all of these products. And this is where AI agents come into the mix, in my view. Once you've built out this hardware layer and you've built out the connective tissue layer, you can actually build really complex agents that are able to do complex tasks. And so for agents, the best way to think about it for people who aren't familiar is it's literally just an AI model that has been trained on some set of data, whether it's yourself or maybe they trained on defi data, so they're really good at generating yield, farming strategies or something like that, and that you as an individual can interact with to carry out and execute tasks for yourself. And it's especially interesting when it comes to the intersection of agents and blockchain, because what you can do is you can give those agents their own wallet to then go execute tasks on their own, pay other agents to execute tasks for them, et cetera, et cetera.
00:08:28.884 - 00:09:18.234, Speaker A: And on the smart agent side, I think the big famous example here is Morpheus, which has gotten a lot of support from ogs like Eric Voorhees. Let's talk about this topic for a little bit. I think what gets hard to understand for me is we already have agents, it's called without crypto. So then to what extent do we need crypto to intersect with smart agents? And I think a good, I guess the point is, and we've had prior podcasts where guests will talk about, we have credit cards, right? We have credit card numbers, we have ways to pay with an agent, virtually. Help me understand what the point is of combining agents with crypto rails.
00:09:18.654 - 00:10:45.834, Speaker B: Yeah, and I agree, because I also get a lot of pushback from people who say, okay, great, you can't really spin up wallets for agents in the tradfi scene, but that doesn't mean that we can't build rails to do that eventually. So I think there's definitely adequate pushback generally. For myself, my view is the reason that it's hard to envision why you should use agents with crypto at scale right now is because we're still so early in the AI crypto infrastructure development phase, and I probably should have started with that. My general view is we're still building out or still even just experimenting with the foundational primitives that will then that then others can iterate and build more complex AI applications and infrastructure on. And so I think right now, basically we have a ton of infrastructure providers trying to figure out what those primitives are. And then you have a ton of application builders who know that there's AI functionality they can integrate with their products but they don't know what the full scope of that functionality is and they don't know which primitive they should be using in order to integrate it because if they choose the wrong one maybe theres a risk that then they have to go through that it doesnt pick up steam and they have to rebuild their stack to integrate with another one or something like that. So I think because the infrastructure side is still so early its hard to envision the more product consumer side of these things.
00:10:45.834 - 00:11:25.586, Speaker B: And Im hoping that maybe in the next six months to a year, just looking at talking with agent teams and seeing where they are in their development progress, it feels like in the next six months to a year we'll start to see. Oh okay cool. These agents are, can be used accessibly on chain right now and interact with each other. We can't do this in the traditional financial world right now. So that, that ease of access I think is hopefully something that happens. But I do think like as agent protocols exist right now they're, they're way too complex. Like you have to be an incredibly sophisticated developer or you probably have to be a incredibly sophisticated end user.
00:11:25.586 - 00:11:29.202, Speaker B: I mean you know like I'm, I'm not interacting with these things, I'm trying to understand them still.
00:11:29.258 - 00:12:50.704, Speaker A: So there's a long way to go definitely. And at the end of the day a developer of one of these protocols or whatever you want to call it, these agents that also have a token or you know, even these inference platforms, they have to compete with literally just OpenAI's developer platform which is so easy to use and it has the best models with the most data. The thing to remember here is I agree, we need to decentralize all this power as far as creators of foundational models goes and networks through which people deploy agents. But the reality is the best products are currently not in crypto. I think that could change with incentives with better data collection at, at the edges of different networks. But how do you think about that? There's basically this interplay here where most developers are probably going to skate towards things like OpenAI and then these crypto products have to compete both on just having probably an inferior AI product initially and also all this complexity you've now introduced by virtue of having a token and adhering to some of these ideals of max decentralization. And some of these teams are completely an on.
00:12:50.704 - 00:12:53.044, Speaker A: Like yeah. How do you think about all that.
00:12:54.344 - 00:13:40.746, Speaker B: I don't really think about it because we work in crypto and that's basically the stats. You know, I think about it this way. I included in my paper as well a kind of graphic on this, similar to what we saw with DeFi. Like, early on in DeFi, it was like pretty basic primitives that were cool and interesting, but could be easily replicated in traditional finance. And it wasn't immediately clear, like, why use these? But what when I started to get excited about DeFi was when we started to see the DeFi Legos play out, and we started to see these protocols iterate on each other and then also figure out ways that they could interact and be composable together to create unique financial products. And that's what I'm trying to. That's what I think is going to happen on the AI side as well.
00:13:40.746 - 00:14:50.436, Speaker B: I think we're just so early right now and building out this stuff is very difficult. We don't know what the primitives are going to be that we're not yet at the place where we can start building these Legos and maybe expanding the design space of what's possible relative to these centralized entities. I don't know for sure whether that's going to happen, but that's something that I'm going to be closely watching over the next year or two is as we see infrastructure side built out, are we seeing improvements in terms of on the product side, and are they at all competitive with things that chat GPT offers? I think the data stuff that you mentioned is really compelling, but I also think it takes a really long time to gather that amount of data where it can be competitive. So maybe in two, three, maybe the next cycle, we'll start to see a lot of these data protocols that are using incentives in order to get people to sell their data or provide their data really take off. I also just think generally it's going to require a huge shift in how people think about their data. I think right now people think about their data as in, oh, Facebook has my data and like, that sucks, but that's the status quo. That's the way the world works.
00:14:50.436 - 00:15:12.624, Speaker B: And it's easy for me, and I think it's going to take a, you know, it takes a lot of education, it takes products that people want to use in order for them to think, oh, actually, there's a different way, there's a different business model. I can, I can own all my data and I can selectively choose who I want to sell it, and maybe I do want to sell it to Facebook and Twitter, and I don't care if they have it, but at least I'm making that decision instead of somebody else.
00:15:18.264 - 00:15:57.204, Speaker A: Right? Right. Let's actually talk about some of these, because you mentioned them in your report, like ocean grass, hivemapper, and then there's guys like demo. To me, what's really cool about them is you can take a foundational model and fine tune by kind of tapping into this crowdsourced data. And to me, I think you can actually get a pretty big lift without a ton of data. Like, you don't need to collect the petabytes of it. Right. And it actually gives you a better product than what you could do off the shelf with an LLM.
00:15:57.204 - 00:16:32.724, Speaker A: Are there any other kind of projects that have. Because I think this report came out about a month ago in February, and there's now like every week it seems like there's new kind of things happening here. Are there any other cool projects? I feel like this could even deserve its own section. I think this will be probably one of the most emergent and powerful intersections of crypto and AI is just incentivizing to your point, that sharing and giving people rewards for sharing their data instead of just having it all siloed inside of different applications.
00:16:33.504 - 00:17:36.068, Speaker B: Yeah, I, to be honest, I would have liked to include data in the report because I agree. I think it's like one of the biggest pieces of this whole thing. I just seen so many people write about it already. I just felt, you know, I felt like I didn't bring a unique angle to the conversation as much. But, but I do think in terms of the data side of things that some of the cooler things I'm seeing, or newer things I'm seeing is, I think we're seeing like, we're seeing tokens, we're seeing projects start to try to implement bit tensor like models with data, create very complex incentive farming schemes to try and get people to provide their data. I think another really interesting thing is things like what the graph protocol is doing where they're basically saying, hey, we have indexed most of the blockchain at this point, but what we have not done it is index it in a way where it's easily readable by machine learning programs. There's projects that are going onto the graph and other data providers and basically re indexing the data.
00:17:36.068 - 00:17:52.304, Speaker B: So it's very simple for anyone working in AI to just have their model train off of that data or use an inference using that data. I think that's going to become increasingly important. As data providers realize the easier we make it for these AI projects to use our data, the more likely they're going to use our data.
00:17:52.844 - 00:18:38.864, Speaker A: For sure. For sure. It's just interesting to note as well, if you step into the web two world, Reddit's going to IPO soon. And I think part of that has to do with just the fact that people are realizing how valuable Reddit's data is. And some of these deals they're striking with unnamed AI companies, $60 million a year plus to have them read through all this human generated, or for the most part, human generated data and then use that to train fine tune models that can deliver a lot of value to consumers. Now on X.com is Elon caught a lot of flack for upping the charge on the API access for tweets and things like that, but he seems to have really quadrupled down on an AI centric vision.
00:18:38.864 - 00:19:07.264, Speaker A: And along the same lines, thats going to be a big revenue driver. And in some ways, that revenue then flows back to creators where they can now earn more through Rev share on the ads, potentially even have a higher percentage of, of that Rev share. And so it's just, it's interesting to compare what's happening in web two versus web3 because those guys aren't necessarily asleep at the wheel. They're moving pretty quickly on AI centered strategies as well.
00:19:07.604 - 00:19:49.070, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great point. And it's probably something I should have covered a little bit more in the report is like, how are web two companies doing this versus web3 companies? But like, the example you just gave with Twitter, I think is also a great example, though, of like just how far AI and crypto has to go. There's no product even close that could really even facilitate any sort of process like that right now. Maybe forecaster or something like that, and maybe there's a cool thing they can do with frames and things like that. But if suddenly being able to use your data on Twitter becomes a new use case, it stays. Definitely going to set back some of the progress being done here.
00:19:49.262 - 00:20:03.034, Speaker A: Yeah. And then you have like guys like Zuck that are pivoting their entire metaverse division or parts of it over to their AI efforts. Funny. No, we had a bunch of metaverse projects come out in crypto. I wonder how they're all doing now.
00:20:03.614 - 00:20:47.594, Speaker B: Well, you know, I bet you like, totally unironically, I bet you a lot of them have pivoted to AI. You know, I've been, I've been actually looking into Makerdao recently, um, I I wrote a big report on their governance before they started this transition to Endgame. And I'm, I'm looking into Endgame. And I talked to Ruhn the other week and he was like, I was interviewing him and I was like, what's the one thing I should know about Maker, Endgame now? And he's like, we're basically an AI project, you know, and, and he's not saying it sarcastically. They're, they're actually trying to build a really substantive AI model that can govern at their dow. But for somebody who hasn't been following Endgame that closely, you're probably like, whoa, everyone's pivoting to AI.
00:20:48.014 - 00:20:58.114, Speaker A: Oh, wow, that's weird. I mean, what exactly does he mean by an AI project now? Yes, I guess I've missed out on what's been happening here.
00:20:58.414 - 00:21:49.054, Speaker B: So maker is in the process of totally transforming their governance structure as this plan called endgame. And they started it last year, and it's just a massive, hugely ambitious plan that is only Roon is capable of having this type of vision. So right now they're in the process of basically building an AI model that can use this. They call it the atlas. It's kind of like their constitution to train off of and then make maker much more accessible to anybody that wants to use it and doesn't understand it. And so the most basic way is like, the simplest example would be like, if you're a new participant to maker, say you just got some and you want to vote in a new vote, but you don't understand what the implications of the vote are. You don't understand how the vote even, like, came to vote and what that process is.
00:21:49.054 - 00:22:35.584, Speaker B: You could just use, it's called gate g a I t. You could just use that and query that and it would give you all the information you need. The more complex things that they're trying to get into are, are like the AI's ability to literally tell people, like, this person is violating the rules and, like, you know, that there needs to be action taken. And so it's a, you know, I think the vision is beautiful. You know, essentially, if he could build an AI model for governing a DAO, that would be incredibly impactful to the rest of the space. But there's just so many questions about, you know, who's, how can you actually implement this? And are we at that stage yet where the models are able to kind of handle the nuance and subjectivity of a governance process?
00:22:36.644 - 00:23:02.244, Speaker A: Gotcha. Gotcha. I mean, yeah, there's different ways you could tackle that too, where perhaps you have a council of different agents that all have different biases or focuses and then put those to a vote in a way before, instead of just anointing one specific model. But are you saying that this approach that he's taking is about just increasing engagement by having this assistant of sorts with information?
00:23:02.984 - 00:23:44.022, Speaker B: I think it's, I mean, just generally endgame is really trying to solve, well, one growth of Dai, but second, like voter apathy, the politicization of the DAO, increasing bureaucracy, difficulty with whale voting and things like that. The idea is if you just make the DAO as accessible as possible, more people are going to want to get involved with it or are going to be less difficult to onboard. And then couple with that with all of these kind of yield farms that they're spinning up and a ton of tokenomics changes that they're making that should draw people in and then the AI should keep people in because it no longer becomes a burden to participate in governance that make them.
00:23:44.198 - 00:24:32.280, Speaker A: Gotcha. Yeah. So it sounds like he's kind of taking all of these documents, proposals, the constitution, you said shoving that as like a context for the LLM, I guess, that's generating these outputs and then allowing people basically creating an easier interface through which one can get up to speed and then ideally vote with the most information that they could possibly have. It's interesting, daos and a lot of crypto projects are often great experiments to see how you can kind of tweak governance and tweak how people participate in different communities. And I wonder if you will see kind of these experiments manifest in like outside of crypto in the real world, because voter apathy is a thing outside of crypto.
00:24:32.312 - 00:24:32.456, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:32.480 - 00:24:57.314, Speaker A: Like any election that's not the presidential election, you know, you're not really getting high participation down ballot when in fact that is probably the most impactful area that would affect one's day to day life. And then it gets into the question of, to what extent are we going to start leaning more on artificial intelligence and tools to better understand what's happening from the voters perspective.
00:24:58.174 - 00:26:02.066, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the big thing that always comes to me when talking about this is, are we making people more stupid? I don't think so. I hope not. But I do think it's a good example of why, you know, the data aspect is so important, because ultimately, if you have a model that is telling people how governance works, you, the first question you should be asking is like, who built that model and what did they put into that model, you know, and if you can maybe take maker's governance model, for example, and you can have it interpret the laws, or you can have it interpret an upcoming vote based on like your own preferences versus somebody else, it just adds a lot more subjectivity to how the model governs the protocol or the application. And that's not really something you want, because as much as we want people to be able to interpret the rules, if you're using a model to tell people what the rules are, it becomes difficult when people are like, well, the model told me that this worked. And they're like, well, the model's wrong. And they're like, well, the model's the constitution, right?
00:26:02.090 - 00:26:35.714, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not a primary source. And then there's all kinds of things you could do in the middle there to nudge people in one direction or the other. This is always kind of an issue I've had, not an issue, but just something I've noticed with algorithms, where you even see it in like GPS applications, where I feel like the meta has changed, where they're almost kind of not always suggesting the fastest route, and in fact they're not. Oftentimes I have to scroll down and find the faster route. But maybe it's because they don't want a bunch of traffic going, going one particular direction. I don't know, I just noticed that it's interesting. That's a great.
00:26:35.714 - 00:27:21.394, Speaker A: And then you could do that with models that are summarizing thousands of pages of documents and have no idea. Yeah. So another area I want to touch on is the rise of, let's call it like chat based interfaces, natural language interfaces. I think a ton of projects are doubling down on this. Dawn. Wallet is an example, even dialect is an example, where you're talking to an agent to do some task. I'm just wondering, do you think that's endgame for how people will use applications? How do you think we're going to see interfaces change as AI products become more embedded in crypto user experiences?
00:27:22.234 - 00:28:33.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I was thinking about this. I have it on my list of to dos to talk to a website UX designer, because in my mind I was initially thinking, okay, interfacing with a LLM or like a chatbot will be much easier for the user. But I do think there's a lot of cases where probably it's just better to point and click where you don't want the optionality and you just want, there's only two options. So I don't need to type this in I just need to click yes or no, you know, so, um, but I, but I do think, like, because the backend of crypto is just so complex for like, the normal user, and because there's such a focus on like, account abstraction, servicing intents and everything like that, that fits perfectly with what these chat bots and llms do. Because if you can just type into an LLM like, hey, I want to swap five soul for ten ETH, it's like that's kind of like you're surfacing an intent, right? And then on the backend you can have these agents, maybe the agent you're interacting with, that chatbot is only just a chatbot. All it can do is understand what you're asking. And then on the other side, what it can do is it can identify the right agent to then execute that task for you.
00:28:33.540 - 00:29:10.440, Speaker B: And so I think, like dawn wallet dialect right now are like the early iterations of what this is going to look like. And then as we see that connective tissue layer built and these AI agents can begin to interact with each other and outside products better, things like Dongwall will sound a lot cooler because you're no longer just be saying like, hey, I want to swap five ETH for ten bitcoin or, you know, whatever. I want to swap some ETH for something. Instead you'll be saying, hey, I have $10,000. I want to earn 15% over the next two years. This is my risk preferences. I cannot lose this money no matter what.
00:29:10.440 - 00:29:19.044, Speaker B: So I'd rather earn less than risk more. And the agent on the back end will say, hey, I got you. I know a guy, actually, another agent, my friend.
00:29:19.624 - 00:29:59.954, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it makes a ton of sense. I think the way I see it is these natural language interfaces are going to look really silly in about, I don't know how long it'll take. A few years, five years, whatever. It's going to look like websites in 1992 or 1998 where they're just like ugly, not really user friendly. It's like hobbyist. I just find that people don't want to write essays when they want to do something. I'll watch people use chat GPT and just see how few words they'll put on the screen and be like, yeah, there's no way natural language is going to be a thing.
00:29:59.954 - 00:31:09.794, Speaker A: I think the intent based stuff is interesting where you can customize the actual UX and like the design based on what you think the user wants to do. And so you'll change like the layout and the buttons and whatever the interface is that feels like probably some form of that is a future. But the problem is, I think a lot of these thought leaders talking about it still assume people are going to type out what they want to do, which to me the future is, it just infers it based on your context and then kind of over time adapts as you do things. I think like concretely a good example of this is like Unibot. That was the most interesting UI game changer in crypto I've seen in the last year, where you're in Telegram and so it just gives you this keyboard layout and you get in two or three clicks, just buy something. And then if you paste a contract address, it just knows and it just buys it for you. Right? Like that feels to me that kind of creativity plus what you can do in the backend with agents, to your point, whether it's one or whether it's one calling on another, on another, I think some combo of that is actually the future of how interfaces will change.
00:31:09.794 - 00:31:23.834, Speaker A: But I think too many people are not taking that leap to that next step of how you make it easier and instead are almost force fitting, like what you can do with an LLM into just every application, which just feels completely wrong.
00:31:24.854 - 00:32:07.856, Speaker B: That's a really good point and I think that's great nuance, to be honest. I think your vision, what you just articulated about how it'll actually end up in a few years, that makes a ton of sense to me. And I also think it highlights. One thing it makes me think of is it also highlights an advantage of crypto because it also just opens up the possibility for people to do whatever they want. I have a wallet and I'll choose myself if I want to do more text based or more click based. And actually, while I'm doing that over a few months, like the wallet will train itself to update the UX so that it's more like, to my fitting. I also think it opens up on the data side or on the shared economy side of things, the hugging face type stuff that's trying to be built on chain right now.
00:32:07.856 - 00:32:26.628, Speaker B: Because you're right. Like people don't want to write out an essay, but prompt engineering is a massive field. So, you know, maybe you just go onto a marketplace and you find the prompt that you want and then you use micro payments on the you backend to pay a tiny bit and that reduces the complexity so you don't have to write those essays. But overall, I totally agree with your view.
00:32:26.796 - 00:32:29.904, Speaker A: Yeah, your UI is going to be quec based, I would assume.
00:32:31.684 - 00:32:32.236, Speaker B: Quex.
00:32:32.300 - 00:32:59.304, Speaker A: It's going to see all those in your wallet and be like, all right, so another area I want to touch on, I admittedly don't know. I know almost nothing about Bittensor. I've played around. I've been on the website of Reddit docs, and like many crypto projects, after doing a deep dive, I walk away more confused than I was going in. Can you describe what is bittencer? You put him in this category of artificial general intelligence on your market map. How would you describe him?
00:32:59.924 - 00:34:30.714, Speaker B: Yeah, so, like, the simplest way I try to explain Bittensor is it's, instead of proof of work, it's proof of model. And what you're basically doing is you have a validator set that is sending requests to a bunch of modelers, who in this case are the miners, and then those modelers are responding with outputs, and then the validator set is grading those outputs and whoever has the best output, or you can customize it based on what you want to do for your specific subnet, which is like your own specific little ecosystem, but you distribute the rewards according to how good the answers are. The idea initially with Bittensor, and it's evolved quite a bit, but I put in the AGI was the idea was if you have a ton of people doing this, you're going to be building a ton of intelligence as all these models improve themselves. And over time you get this agents dynamic that we were talking about where suddenly you have models that are specialized in almost everything and you have a sort of AgI, I think it's called a mixture of experts, where it's like you have a ton of different experts and they work together themselves to give you an answer. So that's like the basic framework for Bittensor. And I really think if you just think about it as proof of model, that's the core concept there that can really help understand it. It has evolved now to the point where initially it was only like, I think there was only eight subnets.
00:34:30.714 - 00:35:06.774, Speaker B: So like eight distinct proof of model ecosystems. For example, one incentivizing, like a LLM chatbot, one incentivizing an image generator. I think they've changed the ecosystem. So now there's, I think, 32 subnets, and you have like distinct teams building different products on each of those subnets. And they have their own custom incentive mechanism, or not custom incentive, but they have their own way of delivering rewards to the miners. So it's evolving into like a very complex system. Just remember, proof of model.
00:35:08.114 - 00:35:38.286, Speaker A: Interesting. I just wonder how they would ever compete with guys like Microsoft chat, DPT or OpenAI rather, where they have hundreds of millions of dollars and they're billions of dollars even and they're trying to build AGI. By the way, how does this differ from upshot, which used to be like an NFT pricing product and now it seems like they've completely moved into the same category. Here is artificial general intelligence protocol.
00:35:38.470 - 00:36:14.774, Speaker B: Yeah, I would put them as very similar. Like, basically there's little like tweaks in the design in terms of like how tokenomics and how they incentivize people. But yeah, they're trying to do similar things. And upshot itself right now, I think is like really focused in on like the defi side of things. But their vision is to enable anything, if I, if I understand it correctly. And they've also launched Allora, which is kind of like this connective tissue layer where you can now basically build any sort of incentivized intelligence mechanism that you want. So I think.
00:36:14.774 - 00:36:18.946, Speaker B: Sorry, Saul, I just forgot what your question was.
00:36:19.090 - 00:36:21.314, Speaker A: Oh, the difference between upshot and bitten, sir?
00:36:21.474 - 00:37:30.628, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. I don't personally, like, I think there's a little bit of differences in terms of how they incentivize people and like the specific things that are happening on each them. But the big difference for me is like community, I think like what sets bittensor apart? And when you ask like what can compete with OpenAI and Microsoft and stuff, like the best chance we have of that is building like cult like diehard communities that are all about decentralized AI on crypto. And if you go into the Bittenster Discord and you talk to some of the teams building on their subnets, you'll see like these are some very serious people. Obviously there's a financial incentive to it, um, which actually helps, you know, bittenters paying out like I think millions of dollars a day for people to send models. Um, but, but you know, they, they have a view like, hey, this is a viable future for decentralized AI and we're going to build on it. So, um, until I don't see kind of those types of die hard people or those types of like really intelligent ex, like open AI people who have moved over to this side, I think it's a viable way forward and I think it, I think it's, might be able to compete very far in the future.
00:37:30.628 - 00:37:45.500, Speaker B: The biggest issue I think for both upshot and for bittenter is, or in my view is like scalability because it's very difficult to create incentive mechanisms that scale to any sort of process that.
00:37:45.532 - 00:38:09.130, Speaker A: Makes a ton of sense. I'm just like, looking at this overview here. I don't know, Matt. It just feels like there's a lot of hype behind these narratives and these projects, and it's hard for me to see where the demand for, or at least from the developer side is going to come from, even like, ZKML. It's an interesting thought experiment.
00:38:09.162 - 00:38:09.482, Speaker B: I just.
00:38:09.538 - 00:38:17.294, Speaker A: I'm not sure how much. How important is it to, like, verify outputs of a model with. With privacy guarantees?
00:38:19.274 - 00:38:21.360, Speaker B: I agree. Yeah.
00:38:21.392 - 00:38:36.284, Speaker A: Like, given just the massive computational additional overhead that it takes to do that, I don't know. But again, this stuff is really exciting to people, and I'm sure a lot of these projects will kind of do well.
00:38:38.104 - 00:40:10.824, Speaker B: I think if you talk to ZKML team, if you talk to Modulus labs, they'll tell you, hey, listen, we are not 100% sure how this is going to turn out because it is too expensive right now and it is too fast, and we don't know who the end client is and we don't have product market fit, you know? So I would just definitely go back to what I was saying at the beginning where we are so early in this AI crypto integration, that there's not even the base primitives yet, and like, yeah, bitten. So it could be an afterthought in a year or two, but it'll probably have contributed like some element in terms of the incentive mechanism or the way the subnets or the subtitles are designed that helps advance and iterate towards a much more practical application of it that hopefully can compete over time. I mean, my general view with crypto is if it doesn't have practical advantages over centralized alternatives, no one's going to ever use that. And it's definitely the case with AI for sure. And I say this in the report, if you ask me what's going to happen in the next six months to a year, in my mind, it's like, oh, oh, we're going to see a lot more developers using, like, copilot to increase their efficiency, and we're going to see, like, people using chatbots to understand protocol documents better. But those are the exact same things we're seeing happen in web two. It's not distinct to crypto and AI, but what it does do is it should help accelerate the pace at which development happens in crypto and AI, and hopefully accelerate the pace at which we can roll out products people want to use.
00:40:16.704 - 00:40:39.634, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. It's quite the comprehensive overview you put together I'd recommend people check out the full report, get the full details from that. Let's jump kind of in the tail end of this jam sesh we're having here to broadly like, what's happening in Solana, what you're finding interesting these days, how you're staying sane in all of this, the market mania that's happening.
00:40:43.654 - 00:41:47.672, Speaker B: I think Solana is in an interesting place. I think, for me, one of the more interesting things is watching it evolve from a single client to a multi client, because I think one of the most exciting developments on the roadmap for Solana is rolling out fire dancer. But what we're also seeing is we're transitioning to multi, or Solana's transitioning to multiclire as fire dancer is being rolled out, and that is slowing down the rollout of fire dancers. So, you know, I think we're in an interesting transition phase where the teams are figuring out how to work together with each other and work productively with each other. And that's really positive. I'm definitely excited by some of, like, the deeper tech conversations happening on Solana. Things like figuring out asynchronous execution, figuring out concurrent leaders, trying to figure out, um, how do we do economic back pressure? Do we need economic back pressure? I I listened to your podcast with Toli where he was talking about how his favorite part was figuring out if they even need proof of history anymore.
00:41:47.672 - 00:42:42.420, Speaker B: So I think, um, I think for those who aren't watching Solana, they don't realize that, uh, there, there's a, there's a lot of developers now operating in Solana, and there's a lot of people at the core protocol level who are thinking deeply about, like, what are the next major tech innovations? And, um, like we've seen with Ethereum, as they move from, like, a single client to multi client, it slowed down the progress of development. And so I'm interesting to see, like, just how much does progress slow down. Ken Solana continue to remain one of the best high performing blockchains. It definitely has the community behind it. I was at Moundao, and I'll tell you, like, people are very, very, remain very active and excited about building on Solana. They see the unique benefits that it has. So, yeah, I think it's an awesome time in Solana in terms of both moving forward with, with figuring out some of the core tech updates they're going to make, and then on the product side, still trying to find, you know, what's going to be that breakout app that people think all right.
00:42:42.420 - 00:42:43.412, Speaker B: This is why I need to use.
00:42:43.428 - 00:43:20.544, Speaker A: Solana, it seems like, because I know you got your start in Solana on the NFT side, that area has cooled down a lot versus. What's heated up is just long tail asset trading, altcoin trading at Solana. What's been your kind of response to that transition? It seems like it's going to be the home of that probably for the entire bull run, which is very new. Unusual that you always. That was always east thing. Um, do you think a lot of that speculative activity has been subsumed now by just like, meme coins and what have you on, on Solana, the liquid side versus the NFT side?
00:43:21.684 - 00:43:58.214, Speaker B: Yeah. So I've been, I've been thinking about it a little bit. I think a big factor contributing to it is one like bitcoin and ordinals. I think that is sucking a lot of the NFT speculation out, out of these other ecosystems. And then I think the second thing is. Yeah, I mean, I think once people realize that instead of trading a highly illiquid picture, they can trade a much more liquid token that is maybe that also has a community element to it. In some ways, it's just an NFT with a much bigger number of nfts minted.
00:43:58.214 - 00:44:42.814, Speaker B: It's just a better way to operate and a better way to do things on chain. So I don't think nfts are dead on Solana in any way. I continue to think that, like, tensor is one of the most amazing products in crypto. I think what's happening with compressed nfts open the doors for a lot of things. I was really excited to see Driphouse working with world coin. I think we might just need to rethink how we think about what the main NFT use cases are on Solana, because there'll always be a place for some ten k PFP NFT collections, but there will also be a place for using nfts as a way to reward, as a way for. Sorry, I just lost my train of thought.
00:44:42.814 - 00:45:06.882, Speaker B: There's also a way to use nfts as a way to reward people who watch your content and things like that. It doesn't need to just be more speculative financialized nfts. We can start using nfts as know $0.01, things that aren't worth very much, but people attach meaning to simply because they follow a creator and was airdropped it from them for sure.
00:45:06.938 - 00:45:40.434, Speaker A: That's kind of like the main one of the thesis behind Rip house as well. It's interesting I wonder why. How did ordinals end up kind of flipping soul as like the non ethanol premier NFT chain or what have you, bitcoin for that matter, because it's not, it's slower. The NFTs are even more expensive than they are in ETH, in many cases, even harder to use than Ethereum in a lot of cases. So how did that happen?
00:45:42.014 - 00:46:23.450, Speaker B: I don't know. I could postulate, I could theorize on why I think it happened. I think would part of, part of the reason, what I think happened is ordinals happened during the bear market on Solana. When the bear market came, nfts got demolished. Yeah, and, but what was unique about Solana is even though they got demolished, you still had a very core communities that kept together. You know, they, they were actually in it because they enjoyed being on Solana and like, they wanted to build out a community that would be there for a while. But because there wasn't really good opportunities for trading, when ordinals came about, you suddenly saw probably the most wealthy chain have opportunities to trade nfts.
00:46:23.450 - 00:46:43.186, Speaker B: I think a lot of Solana people are like, okay, well, we dont have a lot of liquidity. We dont have a lot of volume on our chain. Its a bear market. Theres a new shiny object over in ordinals. We should probably start moving our NFT efforts over there. And we actually saw early on some really big, what you would call Solana. NFT thought leaders transition over to ordinals.
00:46:43.186 - 00:47:18.754, Speaker B: And one of the big, actually, I think the most, or one of the most top projects on ordinals was founded by a Solana person. And one of the other, I think, top 20 projects was also founded by a Solana person. So there's kind of a deep interlink between Solana and ordals, which I think is a good thing. I would love Solana to be more connected with bitcoin. I think that helps Solana. And I think that just kind of absorbed a lot of the NFT speculation and activity during the bear market. And now that we're back in the bull market, it doesn't really make sense to trade nfts on Solano for the reasons we just discussed.
00:47:18.754 - 00:47:48.672, Speaker B: Um, and there's still a ton of volume and liquidity on ordinals. And the meme coin markets on ordinals are very underdeveloped and not very easy to use or good to trade. And so the best way to trade is to trade nfts. I definitely have a theory that once, um, we start seeing things like runes and other sort of kind of like meme coin like things come up on ordinals that, I mean, on bitcoin, we might see ordinals and nfts take a little bit of hit because people won't have to use them to speculate.
00:47:48.848 - 00:48:23.414, Speaker A: I see, I see. What about this emergent like hybrid standard that you're seeing with four hundred four s and turning nfts, having them have a liquid side, so to speak, where you could trade them on a sex, you could also just trade the NFT itself on something like a tensor or magic Eden, do you think that'll kind of have an impact here? Because now you're borrowing from some of this liquid token hype that Solana has and marrying it with the UX and the rich infrastructure you have around marketplaces and wallets and tooling for Solana specifically.
00:48:25.074 - 00:48:38.734, Speaker B: I hope so. I'm not going to lie. I haven't looked into it enough to speak about it, educate or smartly, but I really do hope so. And it's definitely something I've been wanting to look on because I think it's an interesting newstamp.
00:48:39.214 - 00:49:06.062, Speaker A: Totally. To me, that might actually be like the next primitive that captures a lot of people. Yeah, I think a lot of people thought it was ordinals and that might be true. I just find there. The thing is, it has to be easy for new people to use or easy enough. And I think ordinals, it's just like, it's just a little much. I don't see millions of or hundreds of thousands of people kind of aping into them.
00:49:06.062 - 00:49:48.254, Speaker A: Yeah. Although granted they're really popular in the APAC market. But what I do think will happen is if you can marry kind of these two sides of the non fungible side, like the emotional attachment people get to jpegs with this liquid speculative side for people that just want to make it more of a business transaction, which was actually the thesis of blur and tensor. Right. Like they're almost just kind of optimizing for trading floor nfts and giving you all the candlestick charts and making it look like liquid trading. To me that feels like it'll create cambrian explosion of just interest. And you can actually move away from the PFP thing to a degree by doing that and making it just look more like a meme coin.
00:49:49.154 - 00:49:50.294, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:49:50.834 - 00:49:52.242, Speaker A: I'm keeping my eye on that.
00:49:52.418 - 00:49:57.494, Speaker B: So do you think it infuses more of like a community element as a result of it? Basically?
00:49:57.974 - 00:50:17.286, Speaker A: Totally. Totally. I think so. Although granted, like, it's hard to predict until it comes out and we see what people do with it. You know, it's hard to say for sure, but it's interesting, man. I will say Solana does have its share of blue chips. I think mad lads is kind of running back the BAYC playbook this year.
00:50:17.286 - 00:50:40.434, Speaker A: Clearly they got a massive allocation for just wormhole and probably a bunch of others, um, on the, on the horizon. So, you know, NFTs on Solana aren't dead, but, um, it is a weird world now where magic Eden kind of topped all the marketplaces in volume and 80% of that was from ordinals and 20% from Solana. So never really. That was not in my bingo card for predictions for this year.
00:50:40.594 - 00:51:09.682, Speaker B: This I. That's actually, I'm glad you brought that up because that, that is one thing that I do think about. NFTs on Solana, they're definitely not dead. I mean, if we, if we've seen anything from the teams that have built, like, what magic Eden has done in pivoting to bitcoin, like, what tensor has done in terms of, like, going from being like, a three person team to the largest marketplace, like, we definitely have some of the highest quality NFT builders, and I think that they are going, like. And, and when you talk to them, like, they just want to build on Solana. They don't want to go elsewhere to build. And so I.
00:51:09.682 - 00:51:19.674, Speaker B: I definitely feel confident that they are going to be able to take maybe some of these new standards or come up with things themselves that continue to make Solana a really attractive NFT ecosystem.
00:51:20.014 - 00:51:28.478, Speaker A: No doubt the builder quality is second to none and probably only improve as more people get into the ecosystem and excited about it.
00:51:28.646 - 00:51:29.394, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:30.574 - 00:51:37.474, Speaker A: Well, Lucas, we covered a lot of topics today. I really appreciate you taking the time. Are there any closing thoughts before we finish off here?
00:51:39.054 - 00:52:05.162, Speaker B: My only thing would be like, I hope people are sleeping. I hope people are drinking water, and I hope people are eating. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, other than that, I mean, thank you so much for having me. I, you know, please follow me on Twitter. I'm trying to build my Twitter following, and I think crypto and AI is very early and I think we're just beginning to see the base primitives come out.
00:52:05.162 - 00:52:16.744, Speaker B: And so even if you're skeptical of it right now, which you should be, I would continue to watch it because I think in a year or two, we'll start seeing some pretty interesting products emerge.
00:52:17.284 - 00:52:24.024, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Well, Lucas, thanks again for coming on, and we'll make sure to have your link to your Twitter and everything in the show notes.
00:52:24.404 - 00:52:26.244, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me. Saul, good to see you.
