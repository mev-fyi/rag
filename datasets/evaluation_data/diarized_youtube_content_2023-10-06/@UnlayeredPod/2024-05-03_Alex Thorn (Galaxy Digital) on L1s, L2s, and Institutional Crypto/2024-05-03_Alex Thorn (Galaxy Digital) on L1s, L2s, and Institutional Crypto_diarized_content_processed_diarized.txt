00:00:14.240 - 00:00:30.624, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered. Today we are joined by Alex Thorne. He is the head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital and formerly headed up both blockchain and venture efforts at Fidelity. But most importantly, he's been a bitcoiner for over a decade now. Alex, what's up, man? How's it going?
00:00:30.774 - 00:00:37.468, Speaker B: Saul, great to be here, Dave. Good to see you. Great. Great to be on unlayered, man. I'm a fan of this podcast and I've been listening since day one.
00:00:37.556 - 00:00:43.028, Speaker A: I can't believe it's already been a few months since we launched this thing and we already have some competitors, it seems that popped up.
00:00:43.076 - 00:00:43.428, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:00:43.476 - 00:00:46.020, Speaker A: So it's a very exciting space that we're in.
00:00:46.092 - 00:00:52.036, Speaker B: Next generation blockchains, often imitated, never replicated, unlayered.
00:00:52.180 - 00:01:13.892, Speaker A: Kind of on that point, actually. You've spent a lot of time, I think, looking at other layer ones. We've all witnessed that the rise and fall of multiple layer one ecosystems. Do you have a view broadly on layer wares? I know you did a report, or actually we did a report back when I was on the team at Galaxy. Have those views changed since you wrote that? What do you think?
00:01:14.068 - 00:01:37.212, Speaker B: We were just thinking about that. The report was called ready layer one. Ethereum and its smart contract competitors. The thesis, this was December 2021 that we published this. And I think the thesis was that Ethereum, it was Ethereum's game to lose, basically, in terms of. And that wasn't a controversial opinion. I mean, I think when it comes to the global decentralized world computer use case, we had set bitcoin aside.
00:01:37.212 - 00:02:23.190, Speaker B: We said bitcoin doesn't compete with Ethan, despite with the ultrasound money. Boys say Ethereum doesn't compete with bitcoin on what bitcoin is good at. So we'll just set that aside. And then we said in terms of a smart contract platform, that Ethereum was clearly the leader and that it was up to these challengers to dethrone it in an innovator's dilemma. Right. Can the upstart overthrow the incumbent and all the stuff that goes with that? I think we were just thinking about this yesterday, and I think that thesis is only strengthened now with the L2 l two season that we're in and the broad decline of many of the Alt l one communities since the bear market. I think it's only gotten stronger.
00:02:23.190 - 00:03:11.914, Speaker B: The case for Ethereum, again, not on technical merits, not on any of the true fundamental, just purely on the adoption alone, that I think it's only gotten stronger, honestly. And I think this is one of the things that I've always been interested in Solana about, as an example, given the sort of focus of this show, is that it is meaningfully differentiated from a technology standpoint. It's not an EVM clone, right? It's not. And so that has always remained interesting to me. And I think even in this bear market, that Solana is one of the only other platforms that has an ongoing community. If you look at the list of ones we wrote about in that report we wrote was ten competitors and was like Cardano and Phantom. And did none of these things matter at all now? Right.
00:03:11.914 - 00:03:23.814, Speaker B: And look, to be fair, Solana matters a lot less than it did, but it is technologically interesting and it does have a resilient community, and most of them don't.
00:03:23.854 - 00:03:24.006, Speaker C: Right?
00:03:24.030 - 00:04:01.832, Speaker B: I mean, a lot of that, those Alt L1 s were just additional block space, like spilling out over, outside of eth, right. And there was fees were high and you needed somewhere to go. And I feel like with the l two season, I'm calling it, even though most of these things are, you know, not decentralized and not ultimately not good yet, the market doesn't care that much. You talk about base, right? I mean, it's literally a op stack clone, totally centralized. It's given more block space to ETH people, and that's good for them, apparently. So I think it's only strengthened that thesis that it's Ethereum's game to lose in that general smart contracting sector.
00:04:01.928 - 00:04:36.272, Speaker C: What would you say to the suggestion that in crypto, we've only really had minimal product market fit so far? And I would say it's in some fairly limited extensions of Defi, and then also probably Gamblefi is the best way to clarify it. And given Ethereum's greater liquidity, it's obviously winning at those two things. But do you think, as we have more use cases proven out, do you think that that thesis of yours will stand the test of time? Basically, for example, if Deepin starts proliferating, gaming, social payments, things like that, you.
00:04:36.288 - 00:05:22.334, Speaker B: Know, I stand here waiting with arms open for these use cases to present themselves, right? I've been hearing about these supposed mythical additional use cases for years, right? I mean, even take like, Solana as the example, right? It was high throughput, supposed to be able to put, you know, financial stuff on chain at the tradfi scale. Solana is an NFT platform today, as we know well, right. It's almost exclusively the activity on Solana is NFT related. And that was the case during the bull market. Well, you didn't need 60,000 tps for that, right? And the same thing. People come to me, I was talking to some investors who invested in some recently launched high throughput l one s, and I was like, why? Like, we don't need more block space right now. We need applications people want to use, which is kind of what you're referring to, Dave.
00:05:22.334 - 00:05:34.846, Speaker B: It's like these, these actual. We need applications, right? We don't. This. I mean, there's that block. I don't know if you guys saw the. Put out a story on, like, the blockchain protocol ecosystem, and they did one of their markets, and it's just like, all the l one, and there's just like a bajillion of them, right?
00:05:34.870 - 00:05:35.918, Speaker A: It's like 300.
00:05:36.086 - 00:06:01.750, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm asking this guy, he's like, you know, well, what? But, dude, there's some use cases that, like, you know, we can't do without, like, this higher TPS. And I'm like, dude, that's the same thing every, all l one investor has been saying for literally six years. That's what people said about eth. That's what people said about Solana. Like, where are these supposed mythical use cases? Like, so I stand, like I said, I stand with open arms, waiting to see them. I'll acknowledge them when they appear.
00:06:01.750 - 00:06:27.180, Speaker B: But I just don't see the world really demanding blockchain use cases outside of native crypto assets. I don't see it. I'd like to see it. Tokenization is a great example. I've been following tokenization since 2015, and I guess now we have a little bit of real world assets leaking their way into DeFi, but there is no challenge. Defi is posing zero challenge to tradfi. Today.
00:06:27.180 - 00:06:57.856, Speaker B: It's almost exclusively exists so that people that own crypto assets can do financial services. For example, the guy, the curve guy, if he had had, I promise you, if Fidelity would have loaned him dollars on his curve holdings, he'd have done it there. Like, the only reason for Defi is because there's assets you can't use elsewhere. At the moment, it's posing zero challenge to the traditional world. There is no overlap. It is solely an enclosed community. If we throw the spaghetti on the wall and see what's, like, games, not one game.
00:06:57.856 - 00:07:19.824, Speaker B: Show me one game that has adoption, right? There isn't even one. We all get the thesis, you know, digital collectibles and, you know, own, truly own, and then trade your fortnite skins. Like, we get that that makes tons of sense. But. But there isn't one. There's not even one that people love at scale. Right? When I see that one, then I'll agree with you that that's a use case.
00:07:19.824 - 00:07:33.458, Speaker B: Like, but I don't see it. And, and again, deep in, like, dude, nobody needs no one. I don't care what anyone says. No one needs helium. There's no one on earth that can't get a cell phone. Dude, you can get a cell. You can get cell service in the Sahara desert.
00:07:33.458 - 00:08:01.646, Speaker B: Okay? There is no need for it whatsoever. It is completely a solution in search of a problem. Now, do we like it? If we had rebuilt stuff from scratch, would we have it be more decentralized? Absolutely right. We're not wrong. But it's like you're hunting around with the solution in search of a problem on so many of these things. That's why I stay very. And to me it's like, we know there's a use case in demand for bitcoin and it might be a narrow use case, a non sovereign money.
00:08:01.646 - 00:08:23.016, Speaker B: Sure. And then I just look at the entire other pile as like, okay, it's a broad based bet on any of these finally working. Like Defi organization, Gamefi, deepin. Sure. I think some of them will work and we're not sure what. So like, that's the thesis for any, any altcoin to bitcoin is just like, one of them will probably hit and it won't be on bitcoin. So I don't know.
00:08:23.016 - 00:08:24.364, Speaker B: That's a long rant, Dave.
00:08:29.904 - 00:09:01.516, Speaker C: I think out of those, the one that I would really push hard against would be the deep in argument. Because currently you have these industries, infrastructure industries, which are absolutely dominated by behemoths. And if you want to get your foot in the door, you need to spend billions, hundreds of billions just to be able to access the competition. And I don't think that's good for customers. I don't think that's good for consumers. And you mentioned helium. Obviously that's one of several options.
00:09:01.516 - 00:09:53.454, Speaker C: But I think one thing that they are doing, I mean, firstly, it might not be possible to roll out 5g using these traditional centralized players just because you have to have the cell towers so close together that it's hugely, hugely expensive. And secondly, it's about costs ultimately to the customer. If you just have one massive corporation that can achieve this, they can charge whatever they want, whereas suddenly, if you can introduce competition, that's great. And likewise, if you can reduce the upfront costs of the company building out, as you can in the case of helium, by 95%. Because ultimately, the people who are building out the network shouldering those costs, then you can offer a lower cost to the customer. And I think they've just rolled out their $5 unlimited package. So I would push hard against the deepen argument, but I do largely agree with a lot of the other stuff that you said.
00:09:55.034 - 00:10:10.406, Speaker B: No, I hear you. I just don't think of yourself as an advocate for free markets in this analysis, Dave. Think of yourself as a person trying to buy cell service. It's not expensive, dude. It's not expensive at all. It's dirt cheap. You can get $15 a month cell service.
00:10:10.406 - 00:10:19.454, Speaker B: Right. Ryan Reynolds sold his company Mint Mobile. They were offering $15 a month. There is no demand. I refuse to believe that. Sure. Okay.
00:10:19.454 - 00:10:32.950, Speaker B: Yes, we agree. Monopolies. You know, there's probably some math we could show that, like, if at and t were broken up, it'd be a little cheaper, dude. And also, there is no issue rolling out five g. I refuse to believe that there's 5g all over New York City. It's not expensive. Like, they're easily dropping.
00:10:32.950 - 00:10:44.820, Speaker B: It's everywhere I live. I live in a second or third tier city where I live and there's 5g everywhere. There's literally everywhere. There's no issue with this. It's completely made up. Helium opium that. There is a demand for this.
00:10:44.820 - 00:11:03.332, Speaker B: I promise you, dude. Like, no one on earth. You can literally get a SiM card in Nairobi and go into the desert and the phone works, dude. Like, there's no need for this. From a consumer standpoint, what are you going to save? Dollar two. Keep in mind, for an innovator to overthrow an incumbent, we need at least a ten x improvement. And it just isn't there.
00:11:03.332 - 00:11:13.052, Speaker B: I'm telling you. I'll be shocked. Shocked. And I'm willing to eat these words if helium is a success. Shocked. I think that's just totally. That is total hopium, dude.
00:11:13.052 - 00:11:19.864, Speaker B: I completely disagree. Completely sorry. I will say that, you know, it's early in the morning. I'm being silly.
00:11:20.244 - 00:11:36.102, Speaker A: We love it. The ten x framework is actually something I reference a lot when I say, how does crypto improve x, Y or z application? Ten x over incumbents. I totally agree with that point. One quick point though, is that the 5G in New York is actually not that good. I work.
00:11:36.158 - 00:11:39.674, Speaker B: It actually isn't that good. You're right. It's actually. Service in New York is actually kind of slow.
00:11:40.174 - 00:11:50.974, Speaker A: And as ridiculous as it sounds, I actually reactivated my iPad, which is only four g. And it has more like regular service in certain areas of the city.
00:11:51.054 - 00:12:09.678, Speaker B: No, I mean, we're down, you know, I'm down like in battery park area. And actually the service is terrible here for some reason. I don't know why. So. Yes, okay, fair, fair. But again, like, I just don't see the, um. I just simply don't see that, like, dude, first of all, helium, let's also be fair, okay? Helium launched in 2019, dude, it's been four, almost five years, okay? Like, are we.
00:12:09.678 - 00:12:33.984, Speaker B: Oh, man, it takes so long to build a. Blah, blah, blah. No, dude, this thing's a failure. They're on their third reboot attempt of it. Like, I mean, come on, how many, how many? Like, you know, in two years when they say, oh, actually we got to go after this thing now. Are you going to be on that train too, Dave? Like, how many times are you going to give these people an opportunity to fuck up and do it correctly? Like, honestly, like, my God, dude. Like, it's not just.
00:12:33.984 - 00:13:24.938, Speaker B: And I like the idea, to be clear, again, I'm a massive supporter of decentralization as I hope the audience understands. I'm being particularly critical for fun, you know, like I'm actually super, super interested. And if helium or something like it, if we take connectivity or whatever other use cases we want, could be, could be successful. I just want people to be realistic about like the problems and the solutions, right? And when you think about a blockchain, like, you know, a blockchain is ideal for settling value between unknown parties, right? Or even enemies, right? The. The meme, one of the memes is bitcoin is for enemies, right? Not only parties you don't know, but maybe you know and can't trust, right? And actually are enemies with like, that. That final settlement is what blockchains are great for. Like, let's be realistic about which use cases then makes sense for that, right? Like, we don't need.
00:13:24.938 - 00:13:55.134, Speaker B: So that always the joke when people are like, oh, my God, no one's using bitcoin until I can buy coffee with my bitcoin. It's a failure, dude. Nobody needs their coffee payments stored on a global decentralized, immutable ledger for the next hundred years. Like, that's actually not a huge use of this technology, right? Like, it could be. Don't get me wrong, if you don't have financial services or payments options, then sure, global open free money network makes sense regardless of it. But let's be very, very real about when a blockchain makes sense for a use case. Also, it's a great, great point I want to bring up about gaming.
00:13:55.134 - 00:14:31.670, Speaker B: Dude, nobody needs their skins on an immutable database. Nobody needs that. The only reason to do it is because we already have a global decentralized international marketplace on this Internet of value. So yeah sure bringing more assets into it makes a lot of sense. But no one is out here except for ninja that one time they like wiped his Fortnite account or whatever, or Vitalik with his what was his sword or whatever bricked by the developers. Like it's minor. I want people to focus on what the really, really big opportunities are and sure I get at scale a deep in a decentralized connectivity network.
00:14:31.670 - 00:14:52.602, Speaker B: Again, it's something I wish we had. Is it going to be good enough to go anywhere? I just, and don't tell me cost. Dude, cellular is dirt cheap worldwide. Dirt cheap. Literally you can buy a sim card for like $2 at an airport in any country on earth. Like there's no cost savings to be had for the consumer here. Maybe it's a dollar, maybe it's 10%.
00:14:52.602 - 00:14:54.666, Speaker B: I refuse to believe that there is though.
00:14:54.810 - 00:14:59.186, Speaker A: It's definitely cheap overseas. I'll concede that. Us. I guess it depends.
00:14:59.290 - 00:15:27.070, Speaker B: Well you can get those cheap carriers. Like my at and t is pretty expensive cause I've also refused to re up my thing and I've been hanging on to my grandfather at unlimited data plans, which apparently I don't need to because they offer it. Again, it's pretty expensive, but you can get like what are they? I don't know. My mother in law is always telling me about some cheap one that she wants to get and we're like, no, dude, you need like one that works like actually a good one, you know, but there's like all these like cheap mint mobile. Was that example that Ryan Reynolds sold to T Mobile? Like those $15 a month plans? Like there's tons of cheap plans.
00:15:27.222 - 00:15:31.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's usually like low usage, like maybe a gig a month or something.
00:15:31.702 - 00:15:51.254, Speaker C: Yeah, that's again where I push back. I'm not sure I've ever seen unlimited for $5. I think I'm over in the Europe and I think it'd be more like 20 to 30, something like that. And also I don't think that mobile carrier is something which has a huge moat. I mean I think when you're shopping around you just go onto these comparison sites and go for the cheapest one. And so if you've got something which is.
00:15:51.294 - 00:15:54.934, Speaker B: Yeah, they're all, by the way, I just googled, too. It looks like they're all like $30 a month for unlimited.
00:15:55.014 - 00:15:57.270, Speaker C: Are you pulling back from this argument?
00:15:57.462 - 00:16:18.950, Speaker B: No, no. I mean, I'm saying, dude, literally every person in the world, people on, every person in the United States, people on food stamps still have iPhones with service. Like, there's no, the poorest people in America have cell phones. So, like, I'm just saying, like, there's, there's a very, very. I don't know who you're really targeting here. Sure. Would they rather pay 15 instead of 30? I'm sure they would, but, like, that's, that's the case.
00:16:18.950 - 00:16:20.526, Speaker B: Like, that's the use case, that that.
00:16:20.550 - 00:16:29.126, Speaker A: Is a fair point, that it doesn't gain new, a new user base necessarily. It just reduces cost by factor two to three. It seems like for that particular user.
00:16:29.150 - 00:16:54.808, Speaker B: Base, which seems like a cool startup that, like, they should sell to, like, you know, at and t, that's what I would say. Have you been to me in a vacuum today? That's what I would say. You've created an interesting hotspot that maybe you can sell to the big carrier. Good luck as a venture investor. That would be my guess. But also, let's be real. Right? Again, to my point about helium specifically, dude, didn't everyone who ran those, the prior iteration of this project, they all lost money.
00:16:54.808 - 00:17:15.324, Speaker B: They never worked those hotspots. Nobody ended up using it at scale. Like, I'm just saying, how many reset attempts at this are you willing to give the same team? I mean, come on. I have to be skeptical of it overall. Like, you know, when somebody fails, like, not saying they can't come back and succeed, but I mean, like, we're starting from that base. Like, let's be, let's be fair.
00:17:15.984 - 00:17:20.848, Speaker A: That's fair. Let's actually kind of invert this take.
00:17:20.896 - 00:17:21.724, Speaker B: Sorry, guys.
00:17:22.904 - 00:17:50.810, Speaker A: How do you see adoption coming forth? And let me preface this by first saying, like, I think it's a bit interesting that we started with DeFi because historically, financial markets don't come until much later, but we inverted the order of operations here. And that was like the first use case on layer one blockchains like Ethereum. And obviously bitcoin is kind of like that global monetary digital ledger, as you've mentioned before. So, like, how do you envision adoption kind of happening?
00:17:50.962 - 00:18:23.022, Speaker B: Well, it's a great question, and it's a tough question, I really should say when I say it's a great one. Look, DeFi, you're right. I would say, actually, the fact that DeFi is one of the big use cases this early in the crypto story is actually a testament to the lack of other use cases. Again, it was like, well, we have these assets, we built these networks, and in the case of bitcoin, the asset is the product. But ETH wasn't founded that way. It was supposed to be oil for the world, computer, gas to pay the. It wasn't supposed to be an asset.
00:18:23.022 - 00:18:44.974, Speaker B: It was supposed to be a platform. Well, it turned out there wasn't anything good to build on the platform. So they were like, crap, let's build stuff for people that own the asset. Right? Because that's the only people on the platform are people that own bitcoin. They own eth. Right? Like, so it's the financialization of these, of the app layers, to me, is a reaction to the lack of real world use cases. And you're always going to have DeFi.
00:18:44.974 - 00:19:06.288, Speaker B: That's my point about DeFi today. Like, I used to say in 21 and 22, that DeFi was obviously interesting, but it was, at the time, it was just deep pocketed whales re hypothecating to each other. There was no organic usage. No one, no one was taken out a loan on Defi to buy a house or whatever maker. Dow argued originally when they launched, was like that. You could literally buy a boat because you could borrow off your crypto. No one did that.
00:19:06.288 - 00:19:21.074, Speaker B: Like, no one really was using it for finance. It was all because you owned crypto assets and there was nowhere for you to do finance with those assets. Right? So they built. And to me, that that is still the case. And I think it is. I don't see anyone moving from tradfi to Defi. I don't see anyone.
00:19:21.074 - 00:19:44.082, Speaker B: Not plenty of talent is. I don't see anyone saying, gosh, you know what? I was going to do this thing at JP Morgan, but instead I'll do it in Defi. No one is saying that. Right. And I hope that that can change one day. I would love to see, you know, non sovereign or self sovereign finance become more of, more integrated into our actual global financial economy. I think we all would like to see that.
00:19:44.082 - 00:20:25.042, Speaker B: I don't know what. Obviously, we know why it hasn't on Defi yet. There's regulatory, and yes, there's throughput issues, which I don't think are going to be a big deal again. You can spin up innumerable l two s once somebody figures out how to make these l two s decently decentralized block space is not a restriction in my mind, to any of these use cases, really, despite what some new l one investors have told me. So, stepping back to broad adoption, I think, honestly, the most likely case is for bitcoin and maybe ETH as a stakeable asset or just owning them. The ETF, that's going to be the broad adoption to start. Right.
00:20:25.042 - 00:20:52.602, Speaker B: If we think about. This is what I really admire about the Solana community. And while I'm coming out, the mega spicy take to Dave's deep end question, like, the Solana community is trying to build blockchain use cases, and I respect the heck out of that. I'm just continue to be mega bearish on. I just haven't seen any take off ever, and I've been looking since 2014, so I'm not running the nail in the coffin on it, but I really respect that because it's not solely about an asset and building defi for that asset.
00:20:52.658 - 00:20:52.850, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:52.882 - 00:21:20.360, Speaker B: Like, there's a lot of people who think that it can be things like decentralized physical infrastructure or gaming use cases and all that stuff makes a lot of sense, and it's admirable. I'm just like, I don't even want to say I'm cynical. I guess I'm cynical. I'm not skeptical. I'm just straight up cynical about it. I've seen so many pitches on these types of things, and so few, if any, ever actually come to fruition. I think the primary use case for crypto is owning it and trading it today.
00:21:20.360 - 00:21:43.178, Speaker B: And that will be where. And that will be good enough. That will get a bitcoin. ETF will get 20% of investors worldwide to have exposure to bitcoin, and that's adoption beyond that. Again, I like digital collectibles, but the, do we really think big brands are going to have, like, token gated parties? Like, I mean, come on, dude, that's terrible idea.
00:21:43.306 - 00:21:43.882, Speaker A: Coca Cola parties.
00:21:43.898 - 00:22:05.450, Speaker B: You need people to go to parties, not the other way around. You don't keep people out of parties. Anyway, I'm just saying, like, on all these big, you know, the big other sectors obviously have been defi nfts gaming. You know, I guess you can say d pin now, but, you know, that's. I love that you guys, you guys, broadly, web3 type, particularly, like, you know, you had Kyle on your show. Like, was that last week or the week before? Like, D pin. This didn't exist.
00:22:05.450 - 00:22:14.006, Speaker B: You guys just invented this, like, six weeks ago. This. This phrase D pin. Right, right. Like, this is like, no one was calling it dpen in 2019. When. Where did this phrase come from? It's a good one.
00:22:14.110 - 00:22:17.142, Speaker A: It was from the selkist report that he does it every year.
00:22:17.238 - 00:22:19.646, Speaker B: Was it last year's one this year?
00:22:19.670 - 00:22:21.270, Speaker A: I believe it was this year. I could be wrong.
00:22:21.342 - 00:22:23.022, Speaker B: Or like 22, 23.
00:22:23.198 - 00:22:24.910, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty sure he coined.
00:22:25.102 - 00:22:27.126, Speaker B: So it's nine months old or whatever.
00:22:27.230 - 00:22:30.782, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Stood the test of time in some ways.
00:22:30.918 - 00:22:42.070, Speaker B: I want all these things to work. To be clear. Like, when I talk smack about helium, I have no ill will towards that team, and it very well might work. I mean, I'm not. This is just this. I mean, you know what? Honestly, deepen's not even close to the worst one. It's.
00:22:42.070 - 00:23:03.766, Speaker B: It's tokenization. I can't tell you. We joked. We looked at 18 and 18 and 19 when I was doing venture. I think we looked at 30 or 40 tokenization platforms. Um, and this is like the harbors, the templums, the currencies, the securitizes, some of these are still around and have found ways to make money, no doubt. I don't, but at the time, this is such a hot idea.
00:23:03.766 - 00:23:26.180, Speaker B: And we joked that we had looked at more tokenization platform issuance platforms than there were token issuances. Like, there was like two ever. And we looked at 40 and every person was like, oh, we're gonna tokenize real estate. We're gonna tokenize. And it was like, dude, like, show it to me. Where is it? You know, it's like, it's like Ahab's white whale, you know, forever in search and never finding or the holy grail, right? No one ever finds the holy grail. It's.
00:23:26.180 - 00:23:48.012, Speaker B: Everyone's looking for it. It's like, I hope they eventually find it. I would love to own my assets on a public blockchain more than just at a trusted third party, which, as Nick Zabo says, our security holes. Like, I totally agree with that. I just don't see it yet. And I want to be really realistic about. Again, I'm also not in a venture role, so I don't have to have these grand visions of what could happen.
00:23:48.012 - 00:23:56.744, Speaker B: I'm here looking for traction on the ground today, and I just don't see it in many areas that people, blockchain evangelists think it'll happen.
00:24:04.864 - 00:24:45.068, Speaker C: I wonder how much of this isn't people's desire not to use these tools, but is rather the friction that's being created through largely regulation, you know, trying to move your money onto crypto rails is painful trying to tokenize real world assets, because I agree, probably real estate's too non fungible, but something like bonds, for example, you know, or stocks, if they had coin on, easily tradable on crypto rails, I'd be buying coin right now. As it is, I have to set up a Robinhood account and I just can't face it. So as a result, I'm just going to have to watch it moon over the next few years. So I think there is demand, at the very least from the crypto community that sat on those crypto rails.
00:24:45.116 - 00:25:05.664, Speaker B: Just the existing crypto community is big. I mean, there are millions of people that own crypto and that alone is a reason for it to exist. This is one thing where I tell people, I'm like, you don't have to. We don't need that unicorn use case. I mean, it would counterpoint to what I talk about, when do you need a blockchain? Is that, well, who cares, dude? There's millions of people that want to use a blockchain. Forget whether they need it, they just choose to use it. And that's a big market.
00:25:05.664 - 00:25:32.414, Speaker B: And I agree. And look, stocks and fungible financial assets make tons of sense. Everyone knows this. The DTCC, which is the central repository for stock certificates in the US, they wrote a paper in like 2015 that was brilliant. And it was about how essentially their entire existence should be disintermediated by the blockchain. And they're totally right. Like, it's, as we all know, it's public blockchains are phenomenal for recording and affecting the transfer of digital property.
00:25:32.414 - 00:26:06.458, Speaker B: Like that's. They're phenomenal at that. And so, yes, the primary barrier is regulation. And of course with regulation comes incumbents, right? I mean, the regulators regulate the incumbents and sometimes advocate for them, right? So no doubt if there was a fully green field here, we'd be doing a lot more on public blockchains right away. Regulation is one of the core. And I don't, I don't want to say I shouldn't even say regulation. I should say like, you know, rules, existing laws and rules are hostile to decentralized, free and open source software overtaking their moated financial system.
00:26:06.458 - 00:26:22.838, Speaker B: That absolutely is true. The DTCC was completely right, by the way. And they have a great paper. I actually encourage everybody to go read that paper. It's literally, was it 2015 or even 14? It was one of the earliest blockchain papers and they hit the nail on the head. And again, we've seen no movement. Right.
00:26:22.838 - 00:26:30.514, Speaker B: Been. They were like, oh, crap, we're about to be totally disintermediated. Well, good. Luckily for them, that wasn't true, but it should have been true.
00:26:30.854 - 00:26:48.046, Speaker A: One interesting thing, kind of on a different topic, but I read a statistic recently, like bitcoin ordinals, either volume or the amount minted or something, that's down like 97%. That's been an interesting saga from speedrunning.
00:26:48.070 - 00:26:50.972, Speaker B: The NFt story six months.
00:26:51.108 - 00:27:10.508, Speaker A: Yeah, the mania, you know, could this change everything? And then, interestingly, all like, the discourse in bitcoin, the bitcoin community, like, half really like it, half hated it, which I think is kind of a recurring theme with, with bitcoiners generally anytime anything new is introduced. What's your kind of take on all of that?
00:27:10.636 - 00:27:27.700, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. And you're totally right. I mean, bitcoiners are notoriously ornery and hostile to technological change on bitcoin. I think in a lot of ways that is. That's a positive. I think when you look at most other communities, they're aggressively interested in upgrades. So that's a differentiator.
00:27:27.700 - 00:27:46.016, Speaker B: I would say it's the most conservative development ecosystem in crypto bitcoin. So, yeah, that is a recurring theme, Saul. So I think that stat was from corintelegraph and ultimately from DAP radar. I saw that story. I think we did some work. It's not down as bad as they thought. That was trading volume.
00:27:46.016 - 00:28:25.700, Speaker B: And it's not down 97%, but it's probably down like 70% from the peak. But also keep in mind, a lot of that volume was B's. It was BRC 20 tokens, which is really terrible, stupid token standard. When we look at it, we really look at image based ordinals because we think of, I know it's simplistic and I know NFT bulls will say, well, they're more than just images, but if we separate out and only look the images, which are sort of the classic digital collectible use case, first of all, it's way fewer. There's maybe like 25 or 30 million inscriptions, but only 1.5 million of them are images. The vast majority of rest is this text.
00:28:25.700 - 00:28:53.188, Speaker B: There's essentially code for these stupid tokens. That is a terrible way to do tokens, by the way. There are even better ways to do tokens on bitcoin than that. So anyway, yeah, when you calculate the volume down, it's including the peak of that BRC 20 mania, which is really stupid, I would say just broadly, like, who likes ordinals. Well, miners all are universally in favor of this type of activity. Any activity that increases fees, miners are in favor for. And many of them have been outwardly positive on ordinals specifically.
00:28:53.188 - 00:29:33.276, Speaker B: But if they aren't, they in general are happy because they make more money when people transact. I think people worried about the long term security budget of bitcoin are happy now. And I say it that way because I think there are many people who are not worried about that for a variety of reasons. And I tend to be someone who's not worried about it doesn't mean I don't think about it, but I'm not worried. But anyone who's worried, right, likes the transaction fees. And then, I mean, it goes back to this old debate, and it's true on all blockchains, but bitcoin was the iconic about, what is this block space for? Right? And Pete Rizzo, he's at Bitcoin magazine. He's like the editor or something like that at Bitcoin magazine, is a long time journalist, used to be at Coindesk.
00:29:33.276 - 00:30:06.176, Speaker B: He had a great piece about a year or two ago about this dynamic. And he said that there were monetary maximalists, network maximalists, and platform maximalists. And these were sort of the three strands of maximalism in bitcoin, with, of course, the monetary maximalists sort of dominating the current culture. Right? Which is that the idea being that bitcoin is a primarily a monetary asset. First, it is a commodity money that challenges the global central banking domination of fiat money. Like that. That is sort of the dominant culture cultural view in bitcoin now.
00:30:06.176 - 00:30:47.996, Speaker B: But there used to be a strong platform maximalism, which was that. No, no, bitcoin is primarily a platform upon which to build stuff. And this sort of like, you know, even since eth's launch, this fell out of favor. Right? I mean, but, you know, Vitalik was a bitcoiner, right? There was, Satoshi had suggested when people said, should we do, what was it called, bit DNS, like, on bitcoin? He said, no, you know what? Actually, it's probably better to do that on a different chain, is what Satoshi said. But there were people who were thinking about building stuff on bitcoin. And sort of the dominant view became that most of those things you needed to make bitcoin a very composable platform would be too risky to its other good use cases. Right, if we were to.
00:30:47.996 - 00:31:12.146, Speaker B: And so people didn't build stuff on bitcoin primarily. Right? And I would say that. And then the idea behind the network maximalism was like, well, it's actually a peer to peer network. And think of it like that way, primarily. But I think between the platform and the monetary thing, this is something where ordinals really stands out. It does represent a little bit of a resurgence of the platform maximalist concept. I would say it's merely a strain in the bitcoin culture.
00:31:12.146 - 00:31:47.486, Speaker B: It is not dominant at this point. But the old view, people used to say that altcoins were test nets for bitcoin and that anything great that an altcoin came up for would eventually be incorporated into bitcoin. Well, that's just objectively not what happened. Right? Clearly not what happened. But I think that was what a lot of people wanted for bitcoin back in the day. And whether or not using ordinals is how it happens at all, the mere fact that there is this ordinals concept now, I think, has given. It's breathed some fresh air into that concept for people that still believe in it, right.
00:31:47.486 - 00:32:07.478, Speaker B: That you could build stuff on the bitcoin could be a place where you build rather than an asset that you own. I don't know how it plays out long term, but I've been. In that sense, I'm pretty encouraged. I mean, I like people doing weird stuff on bitcoin. That's fine with me. I don't want. I don't want us to have you break the 21 million hard cap.
00:32:07.478 - 00:32:10.598, Speaker B: I don't want bitcoin to become censored. Censored.
00:32:10.646 - 00:32:10.806, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:10.830 - 00:32:24.072, Speaker B: There's plenty of red lines that I have, but if you're not crossing these red lines, I really don't care if you pay fees, I'm fine. If you use bitcoin, and it's an interesting one, it's definitely different. Right. I mean, it's. The ordinal stuff is definitely different for bitcoin, and it challenges a lot of narratives.
00:32:24.128 - 00:32:24.320, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:24.352 - 00:32:29.864, Speaker B: I mean, people really are building some stuff on bitcoin now, and, like, that's pretty new.
00:32:29.984 - 00:32:59.264, Speaker C: How important do you think it is that bitcoin maintains its number one spot? Because, you know, if Ethereum does manage to overtake it, suddenly you have a yield producing asset. And then if we're talking about what's going to be a better store of value, arguably, over the last 40 years, the best stores of value have been stocks and real estate, and both of those do produce assets. Is there a risk that bitcoin could lose its meme status almost as the global reserve currency and digital gold?
00:32:59.924 - 00:33:34.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I really do think it's pretty unlikely, at least in the next ten years, that Alt L1 gas token or primary asset that powers a different blockchain would become more valuable than bitcoin. I think that's unlikely. I'm not going to say it doesn't matter. I think if it weren't the biggest, that would hurt its status. I certainly dont disagree with that. I dont know if in the long run, in the biggest version of this possible future, if it is that big a deal. Gold is not the most valuable asset.
00:33:34.314 - 00:34:00.064, Speaker B: Its big, but stocks are bigger. I think it depends on what bitcoin becomes. But if we were to say it is, it's only going to be digital gold, but it does achieve digital gold status. Let's say that, right. Well then it shouldn't be the biggest. I mean if the ethereum, honestly, if it's bigger than Ethereum, Solana, et cetera, Defi world, then that's really more of a story than that. Those have failed.
00:34:00.064 - 00:34:56.084, Speaker B: Because I think if we're going to have all financial services on a blockchain, there's no way one single digital gold asset should actually be worth more than all of that. So I guess I'm of a few minds. I mean, I do think it matters. I do think, don't get me wrong, if Ethereum flip bitcoin, there'd be a lot of smoke. People be throwing a lot of smoke. And it would, you'd see a lot of cope and seethe on the bitcoin side, you'd see a lot of like grave dancing from ethereums and it, and it would just like, you know, it would harm, I think, the bitcoin story in the short term, but I don't think it's the end of the world. It is just one asset, right? I mean, in order to flip bitcoin, dude, ETH has to have like literally 75 potential blockchain use cases that everyone's juggling, claiming is going to be good, while none of them are really hitting, you know what I mean? Like it's, it's a lot, it's a big giant, you know, card, uh, carnival that they're running over there on the Ethereum blockchain.
00:34:56.084 - 00:35:25.778, Speaker B: And, you know, and they still haven't surpassed the one asset. So I don't think in the end, like, you know, and again, a yield bearing asset, like you can be productive with your eth, right? And so look, I mean, imagine you're sitting in a non yield bearing asset. Now what are you like, crazy? Yields are 5% in a money market fund. So I hear you. I mean, there's a lot that makes sense. I don't think of it as a store of value doesn't have to earn yield to be honest. Like, it depends on what you think of a store of value.
00:35:25.778 - 00:35:30.862, Speaker B: But store of value is supposed to be relatively stable and credible asset.
00:35:30.918 - 00:35:31.230, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:31.302 - 00:35:40.334, Speaker B: Gold doesn't earn any yield. Right. But it's been used for thousands of years for wealth preservation. So I don't know, does that answer it? I'm kind of saying, like, yes, but no, maybe.
00:35:40.414 - 00:35:44.422, Speaker A: So there you go. Cover all your bases.
00:35:44.558 - 00:36:02.044, Speaker B: Exactly. I'm still thinking back how I came out super spicy on this D pen question. I want to apologize to my dreamers out there who are trying to build for a better, decentralized future. I'm super in support of that. Just like being spicy on this particular use case.
00:36:04.544 - 00:36:22.644, Speaker A: So one of the many kind of hats you wear in your current role is interfacing with the world of institutional crypto. Are you noticing any themes or interest areas? I mean, obviously we're all kind of waiting for this decision on the grayscale trust, but anything else and kind of what do you think is going to play out on that front?
00:36:23.544 - 00:37:05.992, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think, look, in crypto investing world right now, like, in markets, like, there is a distinct lack of catalysts. I mean, that's why you saw volatility basically compressed to historic lows. And obviously it came up a little bit as we moved lower last week. But really, there's just not much going on, honestly. You got some of these court cases which could have positive or negative catalysts, whether it's grayscale and the SEC or the coin based stuff or who knows what else. Otherwise, we're looking at a macro situation that was supposed to be deteriorating. Instead, stocks have had one of their best years on, on record this year, but now looks like it may be deteriorating again.
00:37:05.992 - 00:37:12.360, Speaker B: Right. It's not clear. You get problems with China. You get the rate situation. The Fed still doesn't look like they're about to halt hikes.
00:37:12.392 - 00:37:12.536, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:12.560 - 00:38:00.186, Speaker B: Like a lot of people waiting for, you know, shoes to drop on macro, and then you just look at, you just don't see that much positive stuff on the horizon to propel crypto forward. Now, new apps that launch that are wildly popular, that could be a catalyst. Right? Like I said, I mean, a grayscale victory. I mean, our view on this is like the best case scenario for Grayscale is that it's essentially just kicked back into the SEC process and maybe there's some mean language from the judges about the SEC, which would make it slightly better, but the case does not result in an ETF being approved. So we got to be realistic about what a win here looks like for the market. It's not that impactful. Like I said, I think the best case scenario is that they say a bunch of mean things about the SEC.
00:38:00.186 - 00:38:34.040, Speaker B: In the opinion, it's probably about as good as you would get from a knockout victory there. But also, you have no idea when these rulings come. Take as long as they want. So it's very, very hard to prognosticate market impact when you have no idea when it's going to happen. Let's be real. I think the market is pretty convinced that it will be a grayscale victory at this court. Elliot Stein, who's a senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg, pegged the likelihood at 70% likely that grayscale prevails in its case there.
00:38:34.040 - 00:39:16.728, Speaker B: But we don't know what's going to happen. That could be the opposite for all we know. I mean, court cases are, and we're saying this is because there's so many potential catalysts out here that are court related, and it's like you really have no way to know what's going to happen. And I was saying, one of the things that surprised me about the SEC's approach is that they're just willing to roll the dice in so many court cases when they could undertake comprehensive and formal rulemaking process. Right? And look, they could win in these cases, some of them, but they could also lose, and they could. And losses for the SEC, depending on the case and the circumstances, could result in significantly curtailed power for the regulator. So, like, it's kind of, and the reality in court is you really just don't know what's gonna happen.
00:39:16.728 - 00:39:39.154, Speaker B: Like, almost anything can happen. So, like, it's kind of crazy as a strategy, in my opinion, to have so much of their regulatory strategy right now be related to court cases. And the same thing is true for the market in general. And these catalysts, again, we can't count on outcomes. We don't know when they'll come. We don't know what they'll be. They can also take really long time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
00:39:39.154 - 00:40:02.344, Speaker B: And then outside of that, when I talk to, that's what they're looking at. They're looking some potential cattle. So you have the possibility of futures ETF's people are thinking about in the fall. You've got all these court case outcomes maybe you have legislation, although, I mean, it's looking a bit precarious. But you have the market structure bill and the stablecoin bill in the us house, that could be a catalyst.
00:40:02.384 - 00:40:02.752, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:02.848 - 00:40:25.922, Speaker B: But outside of that, no one thinks that there's no upgrade for eth that's going to change the game. No one's like, oh my God, when that big Solana upgrade comes, that's going to totally alter market structure. I wouldn't say there's very many native crypto catalysts that people see on the horizon. I would say the having bitcoin having is in April. That historically has mattered. Theoretically it should matter half as much every time.
00:40:25.978 - 00:40:26.218, Speaker C: Right?
00:40:26.266 - 00:41:01.342, Speaker B: And on an absolute basis, like having from 900 coins issued per day to 450 is a pretty small change on an absolute basis at this point. So its impact on actual supply side economics, like supply and demand should not be that big. But the marketing event, the quadrennial story, the fact that could still be positive. And then, of course, next year you have presidential election. And I think next year is the year for it to be pretty spicy in markets. You could have a bitcoin ETF, you could have presidential election. It shakes things up.
00:41:01.342 - 00:41:08.854, Speaker B: You could have the bitcoin halving, et cetera. So I think markets are poised to be more interesting in 24 than they've been in 23.
00:41:09.014 - 00:41:40.944, Speaker C: I think I share a slightly similar sentiment to you and that I think macro could change and hopefully that will produce some bullish tailwinds for crypto. But it's hard right now to see what the crypto internal changes are going to be that are suddenly going to drive loads and loads of people, as we had with defi Summer, really the last time. Obviously, at the moment we've got some excitement around friend tech. Um, just wondering if you think maybe that's going to be the thing to, to really drive people into crypto rails.
00:41:41.104 - 00:41:48.752, Speaker B: Yeah. On chain summer. Right. What Coinbase calls. I was calling it l two season. Yeah. I mean, I, like I said, an app could, could propel.
00:41:48.808 - 00:41:49.000, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:49.032 - 00:42:03.974, Speaker B: Or like, let's say, you know, Call of Duty ads, nfts finally, or whatever. Right. Like, or that a crypto native game has a breakout hit and becomes just like, worldwide famous. Right. Unpopular. Like, those could alter. And to be honest, those could also happen at any time.
00:42:03.974 - 00:42:30.358, Speaker B: I don't think friend tech is it. There's. There's obviously demand for some kind of better social media situation, whether it's because of Elon Musk and X or people's longstanding problems with Facebook's properties and whatnot. Like, I mean, I haven't been on Facebook in like 15 years or something. Ten years. There's obviously demand for some, some improvement in the social media experience, right? Like for no matter which side of the. Whether you think they don't censor enough or they censor too much.
00:42:30.358 - 00:43:08.640, Speaker B: Like everyone's mad at big tech, right? Both political parties in the US both mad at it. So in that sense, I think something like friend tech, which doesn't approach all of those problems, but does something I would say is more about creator economy monetization problems, which people also have issues with. I think just the excitement around it shows that there's demand for change here. I don't think that owning a key to a influencer's private chat is going to be the killer use case, but we'll see. Maybe they'll come out with some new stuff. I think I really liked about it more than anything is that the. I just learned about these, but the add to home screen, the progressive web app.
00:43:08.640 - 00:43:10.336, Speaker B: Big reason why it's been successful.
00:43:10.400 - 00:43:10.696, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:10.760 - 00:43:16.976, Speaker B: And that doesn't have to be approved by the various app stores either. So that's quite interesting. I wonder what else people will build with that.
00:43:17.160 - 00:43:48.696, Speaker A: Yeah, it's only I think recently that you could do push notifications with Pwas. And so that was like the key thing, I guess, that the developer decided to leverage for. And I agree. I think we'll start to see a lot more of these crypto apps. A lot of them are already switching over to pwas as we speak. Kind of use those to enable the wallets. That, plus the embedded NPC wallets, which I'm very bullish on, I think will basically be how almost everyone uses crypto on their mobile phone until we kind of figure out count abstraction.
00:43:48.696 - 00:43:50.464, Speaker A: And that's more of a mainstream thing.
00:43:50.624 - 00:44:05.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I don't, don't even. Let's not even talk about account abstraction. I'm literally waiting for someone to explain this to me offline. Like, I've got someone writing a report on this. I haven't bothered to follow this concept, to be honest. But yes, I agree that the embedded NPC stuff is really powerful.
00:44:05.604 - 00:44:21.826, Speaker B: And. Yeah, I mean, I look, I mean, friend tech is easy to use. They did the main thing right. They hope maybe other features will come soon, but they started with the speculation and that's, you know. You know, Dave, you mentioned Gamblefi, which I love that I used. I just call that gambling. But yes, absolutely.
00:44:21.826 - 00:44:33.570, Speaker B: Massive use case for global decentralized blockchains right. And actually, I'm actually shocked that it hasn't been a bigger part of the crypto story over the years. Right. You'd had those, like, prediction markets.
00:44:33.602 - 00:44:34.034, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:34.154 - 00:45:07.970, Speaker B: Auger was going to change the world. Back from the day again, I still love the idea, but it didn't change the world. And I'm actually kind of surprised because the global decentralized gambling is as old as humanity, but it's an incredibly regulated activity. So, like, cross jurisdictional global jurisdictional arbitrage platform, which is what public blockchains can be kind of surprised it hasn't taken off more. But obviously, that's a big part of friendtech. I'm taking the high road here and saying it's emblematic of people's desire for change in social media. Well, it's also gambling, and people like gambling.
00:45:08.162 - 00:45:51.434, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I think it's kind of a thesis on social, at least in terms of how crypto will help out or improve social ten to 100 x. Like my thesis has always been at must rely or heavily use kind of financialization or speculation, because those in crypto, to your point, are way better than doing it through the traditional rails, because it's global and permissionless. And I think that's kind of what friend tech was able to put front and center was this idea that your shares, or keys, as they call them now, could kind of moon as a creator, and then you have all the bots come in and all the excitement and activity. I mean, the app itself, there's nothing to do on it. It's literally, especially if you don't have a key, you can just look at the potential rooms you can buy.
00:45:51.434 - 00:45:53.282, Speaker A: Right. There's no discovery even.
00:45:53.458 - 00:46:03.306, Speaker B: I agree. Then as part of the l two thing, this is another thing I've always appreciated a lot about the Solana world, and I know it's actually kind of changing.
00:46:03.370 - 00:46:03.594, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:03.634 - 00:46:07.682, Speaker B: There's some talk of, you guys are going to have to become layered at some point.
00:46:07.738 - 00:46:07.930, Speaker C: Right?
00:46:07.962 - 00:46:34.640, Speaker B: There's some talk of layers, even with Solana. In some ways, maybe not, but I. Yeah, well, even leaving a side scale with hardware, which I think is a reasonable thesis for building a blockchain, it's that there are composability issues. And a world that's l two s all the way down, is like a world where it's hard to do stuff across these l two s. I don't want to add. Going to metamask and, like, add, like, whatever. Like new thing all the time.
00:46:34.640 - 00:46:54.592, Speaker B: It's annoying. Right. I get that. I don't know if they're gonna solve that one day by, you know, making the l two s all feel like l one or something. I don't know. But, like, that's something that is interesting to me because even, like, you know, you're on the op stack and it's like there's a bunch of others, but they're not actually connected. It's sort of like the cosmos.
00:46:54.592 - 00:47:10.242, Speaker B: It's like turning the cosmos thesis on its head, right? Like it's app chains, but there's no hub. Or I guess eth is the hub. Like. But, like, you know, like, you can't easily. It's kind of the same problem cosmos had, which was like, no one's actually connecting to the hub. Right. I don't know.
00:47:10.242 - 00:47:39.654, Speaker B: It's like, that's something I worry about, and, well, I don't worry about it. I think about it in terms of scaling blockchains and, like, you know, just, I like a layered approach, personally, because I want to maintain the fidelity of the underlying l one. You know, as a bitcoiner, that's very important to me. I, like I said, bitcoiners don't want to sacrifice the fidelity of the l one's properties in order to gain things like, you know, ux improvements. Right. That's too high a bar. And in that sense, a layered approach is safer.
00:47:39.654 - 00:47:52.490, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, you know, you can't, like, move from. I can't move from base to, like, arbitrum, really at all. I have to go all the way back through the l one. So it's like, is that really, aren't we creating, like, silos now? It's just kind of a weird. We'll see how it plays out.
00:47:52.562 - 00:48:07.852, Speaker C: Yeah. You think of something like a price discovery, you know, how does that happen when you could be offered different prices across all of these l two s, l three s, and obviously, you can maybe try and join it all together and finally come up with some answer, but you're going to have massive latency. The purple.
00:48:08.028 - 00:48:37.304, Speaker B: Well, you're just going to have market makers across all of them setting the prices. They're going to be on all of them. That's honestly, I don't think I agree. It's just clearly inefficient. If you're breaking the market into a bunch of different liquidity pools, there should always be one liquidity pool. I mean, american capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world because it's like Nasdaq and Nyse. It's like two places if there were 50 places, then it would be all disaggregated and annoying.
00:48:37.304 - 00:48:56.484, Speaker B: But you would still have high frequency market makers setting the prices across all of them. Right. Someone else, you, the user, would not be able to go across all of those fragmented liquidities, no doubt, but you're not going to be the one that has to do it. There's going to be pros that, arb that and bring those prices in line and all that. But again, yeah, it's just patently efficient.
00:48:56.824 - 00:49:19.354, Speaker C: Have you found it surprising that base, I think, is now already doing more transactions than optimism and arbitrum? Because just from, if you just look at it, you're saying, okay, well, it's far more centralized and it doesn't even have a token, and yet it is seeing a lot more uptick. So, yeah, just wondering how you're seeing that. And do you think it's going to last?
00:49:21.214 - 00:49:35.366, Speaker B: That's a great question. I don't know. It's been surprising. There's some meme value. I mean, I think it's, you know, you've got a large public company promoting it. I don't. I don't know.
00:49:35.366 - 00:50:07.592, Speaker B: I mean, yes, I've seen that daily. What was it, dau? Maybe the chart, the train? Or is it transactions? I can't recall. But yes, I think probably most of that is friend tech. Um, but I've been surprised, and I don't know how long it will last. Um, I think, look, people don't care. Do you need decentralization for your social media? Like token maybe? I mean, more than, like, you probably need it more than if you were, you know, trading in a, in a physical real estate where you actually have to know the party directly anyway. Okay.
00:50:07.592 - 00:50:36.104, Speaker B: Like, you know, but, and you need it less certainly than you do if you have global decentralized money. Right? So, but, like, I mean, I think some people are going to realize people will eventually gravitate to the higher fidelity, the things that are fast and secure. And typically that means decentralized. And so the game has been trying to be decentralized and fast. I know this game Solana has been working on a long time. My point is that base is not very decentralized. Right.
00:50:36.104 - 00:50:54.834, Speaker B: That might even be a charitable way of saying it. And I don't know, people don't care right now for the use case they're using it for, but eventually that will matter. And so I can't imagine if in its current form, that base is the solution to the global block space problem.
00:50:57.174 - 00:52:11.622, Speaker A: Yeah, I think what it does is it provides a good user experience that doesn't require dollar five of gas to do anything on chain. And what they have going for them is the coinbase wallet and Coinbase, the website, both make it really easy to bridge fiat dollars into base and out of base. So I think that's going to probably propel them to be, in my view, like the next BSc, the go to default, just slightly more scalable EVM solution for both developers and users. And I think it's higher level, though, the key challenge for Solana, that these EVM chains, l two s and eth as well, just has a ton of money parked there already. And it makes it really easy to just move into any of these ecosystems and move out without needing a ton of bridge liquidity. And that feels to me like, I guess the question is, do we see that changing? Do we see new monetary flows going into a completely new layer, one, whether it's Solana or even these challenger ones, like how, how did they solve that problem? Because that feels to me like the actual key challenge here as we try to skate towards, you know, retail adoption.
00:52:11.718 - 00:52:25.182, Speaker B: Yeah, it is a challenge that's sort of a Lindy effect, you know, and yeah, I think to the extent that, like all l one communities have been successful is they've sort of just built their, rather than vampire, although maybe they vampire attack a little bit on the existing ones. They just built their own.
00:52:25.238 - 00:52:25.430, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:25.462 - 00:52:51.274, Speaker B: And Solana's done a good job at this. There is a. But, yes, I mean, you're competing against Ethereum and bitcoin communities where there's a lot of value locked there, and that's going to be very hard to. This is why we said Ethereum and smart contract competitors. Ethereum is game to lose. It is. Ethereum has by far the most developer and financial mind share in crypto, I would say.
00:52:51.274 - 00:53:16.172, Speaker B: And look, a person can only work on primarily. Well, it's not actually true, but for the, you know, you could say pretty much a person only work on one thing at a time. Right? Like you can't have, I don't know of a single Solana and eth core dev. Right. No one's core dev ing both. Right. And so you're competing for the same developer mind share, and theoretically at the app layer, you're also competing for developers and builders.
00:53:16.172 - 00:53:32.934, Speaker B: And then of course, you're, you know, you can't double spend capital, really. I mean, you could recursively loop loan it and whatnot. Sure. And defi, I guess for every rule crypto often has an exception. But in general, right, you can't double spend. So you gotta have. If your cash is in point a, it can't also be in point b.
00:53:32.934 - 00:53:45.246, Speaker B: So, like, there. There's. There's competition there. No doubt. That's the wind. One of the weirdest things about this space that's super interesting is that people own financial interest in the early stage. Tech at scale.
00:53:45.246 - 00:53:48.634, Speaker B: It's strange. It causes all types of interesting stuff.
00:53:53.744 - 00:54:19.682, Speaker C: I'm not sure how long you've been in the space, Alex, but I feel like. I feel like maybe once people have been here for so long, it's kind of hard to keep looking at all of these new. New chains, new inventions, new narratives, which are going out. It reminds me of Kobe, for example. Listening to him when he was still around for the last year or two, it just sounded like he'd sort of given up. So I feel like you've been here for a while, and yet you've got your own research hub, you've got your own podcast. So what is.
00:54:19.682 - 00:54:22.346, Speaker C: What's keeping you going? What's keeping you optimistic?
00:54:22.450 - 00:54:49.970, Speaker B: Yeah, it really is hard not to become cynical, I think, because that's what I was saying before, you know, like, I think the key for me is making sure that I'm always willing to be proven wrong here and again. Go back to my rant on deep end. Like, I'm willing to be proven wrong. I'm hoping that I will be right. I say this about tokenization all the time, too. Right? We looked into all this, and there was reasons why it didn't make sense, or we didn't think it would happen anytime soon. We were right.
00:54:49.970 - 00:55:09.014, Speaker B: It didn't happen soon. Maybe it is starting to happen now. Gosh, I hope it does, because a public blockchain is a significantly better place to record and transfer value. I think that's just a fact. It's very, very good for that. That's pretty much, in my view, almost all that it is good for. But there's a lot to unlock there from that.
00:55:09.014 - 00:55:34.810, Speaker B: Um, and so, yeah, but it's, you know, the reason that happens when you're in crypto for a long time is that we've already talked about this stuff, dude. Like, we've been talking about this for eight years. People come around, they're like, oh, man. Like, what about the Ethereum name service? I'm like, satoshi literally proposed that right name coin. It was the first altcoin. That's literally, like, now. Does it mean it was a bad idea? Ens is a huge project.
00:55:34.810 - 00:56:02.106, Speaker B: It's a legitimate idea. Right? Like, on ethnic whatever. So. But it's kind of like, dude, everything old is new again. Like, if you. That's why I tell people, researchers that I work with, like, dude, like, if you don't know about the history of bitcoin, you really don't know about crypto, because so much of what is being done now was thought up by bitcoiners or rejected as something not to do on bitcoin that resulted in the creation of the altcoin that you random anon just heard about.
00:56:02.170 - 00:56:02.370, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:02.402 - 00:56:34.934, Speaker B: Like, it all stems from the. If you go to bitcointalk.org and reread the old threads, like, every single. Almost every idea that people are doing in crypto today was contemplated already ten years ago. That doesn't take away from the ideas and certainly doesn't take away from the technological innovation that we are seeing. There's plenty of innovation since then, no doubt. But I'm just saying it can get hard to hear people, you know, think, boys, mansplaining some concept to me that I read about ten years ago as if it's some new idea.
00:56:34.934 - 00:57:00.602, Speaker B: And that happens a lot. Right? So I would say, that being said, you know, I would say that's. That's some of the reason you get, you know, some cynicism from people that have been in crypto a long time. That being said, I am very excited by a lot of innovation happening, and. And I. And I'm really interested in adoption. And what I mean by that is I spend most of my time trying to determine if adoption is occurring.
00:57:00.602 - 00:57:19.522, Speaker B: When I see it happening somewhere, I want to know why. Right. And that story has been interesting and changing the whole time, but it's a grind, right. Every quarter in crypto is like five years in human time. Right. I mean, it's like I started going gray. This is literally from last year.
00:57:19.522 - 00:57:46.762, Speaker B: This is just 2022 on this beard. So, um, yeah, it's exciting. It's. I will say it's all. I'm. I don't want to at all make it sound like I'm critical of young, new people getting excited about crypto use cases. Um, and, in fact, that's one of the things I like most about my job, is that I work with a lot of young, energetic people who are super bullish on crypto, and they also help, you know, it's a.
00:57:46.762 - 00:58:21.452, Speaker B: If you sit around in your boomer aloneness, waxing poetic about how we already talked about this ten years ago on bitcointalk.org, dot yeah, you're going to get cynical and burned out. I think if you get into these communities and realize that there is still a lot of excitement about crypto at all levels of career experience in all sectors. Every day I meet new people who are very, very bullish on crypto also. They're all a lot smarter than we used to be. Like, you know, somebody I talked to, they're like, yeah, I just got into crypto. Got into crypto back in 2021.
00:58:21.452 - 00:58:40.340, Speaker B: I'm like, dude, that was 5 seconds ago. And then I'm like, wait a sec, that was two years ago, right? Actually. Wow. If you've been following it for two years, you actually might know what you're talking about. Right. To me, that makes it seem like you're a noob, but you're not because that was two years ago. So, like, people are a lot smarter on crypto than all people like.
00:58:40.372 - 00:58:40.540, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:40.572 - 00:58:45.976, Speaker B: We're all getting smarter about what it is, how it works, what it's going to be good for, and that also helps keep me energized.
00:58:46.080 - 00:59:11.388, Speaker A: Right, right. We obviously covered a lot of topics, a lot of spicy takes throughout. Maybe a bit of a closing question here. Something I think about a lot is, and kind of piggybacking on this broader point we just made. You know, I've been in crypto a while. My first interaction with it was through bitcoin. I think a lot of people's first interaction in 2017 might have still been bitcoin, but starting to be more these altcoins that came out, the IcO boom.
00:59:11.388 - 00:59:37.350, Speaker A: And then to your point, 2021, I think a lot of people just literally went directly to either DeFi or an NFT, straight to eth. I mean, if you had to make a guess, like, whenever this next kind of cycle comes about and adoption ratchets upwards, what do you think is going to be the key? Are people going to even touch or care about bitcoin? Are they going to go, is it going to be an eth? Is going to be an l two, or maybe one of these really scalable all l ones? How do you see that playing out?
00:59:37.412 - 01:00:08.086, Speaker B: That's great. I don't know. I don't know. I think it's more likely to be bitcoin related than people realize because of regulatory reasons, I think including the launch, potential launch of a bitcoin ETF. So I think a lot of people's, quote, unquote, a lot of new entrants, exposure to crypto in a next bull run will be through a regulated financial product, like a bitcoin ETF. And so it'll be bitcoin, um, which is different than I think. I totally agree, Saul, with your.
01:00:08.086 - 01:00:31.942, Speaker B: Your mini history there, of. Of how it worked, right? And even in the ICO era, like, you had to buy bitcoin to then take it to buy eth, right? Like, I mean, like the way the sort of onramps worked, right? And most trading pairs were bitcoin denominated, actually, which they're not now. Right now we have stables. And so, like that. That has changed, like, bitcoin's utility in crypto markets from on off ramp to, like, now just asset.
01:00:31.998 - 01:00:32.214, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:32.254 - 01:00:36.830, Speaker B: And that probably does dampen demand for it in comparison to prior ones.
01:00:36.862 - 01:00:37.054, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:37.094 - 01:00:59.942, Speaker B: But I do think because of regulatory stuff and by the way, because defined nfts, everybody already, like, knows about. Right. They're not going to be novel the next time. I think Bitcoin has a better chance of being the reason again. But I will also say there could be, you know, new apps or categories of apps we don't even know about. It could be deepen. It absolutely could be.
01:00:59.942 - 01:01:24.248, Speaker B: It could be games. I mean, I continue to think the biggest black swan, Dark Horse is like a Call of Duty quality game that has crypto in it. Like that would absolutely just shock rock the entire space and the world. One, one breakout hit would be a game changer, no pun intended. So that could be the reason. It's really hard to know. But I don't think it's not going to be enthusiasm around infrastructure.
01:01:24.248 - 01:02:04.694, Speaker B: We have all the infrastructure, so it's got to be app level. And I think it's more likely to be asset bitcoin or ETH asset as the sort of breakout thing because we're likely to have better and easier market access vehicles. And that's the people that are new entrants in this dude, all the people that like this stuff, there's no dgens on the sidelines that haven't heard about crypto that aren't already interested in it. It's not going to come from crypto native Defi summer type use case. I don't think we already have all that. It would need to be a game changing new space like that on chain. Or more likely, I think the, you know, the new entrants are going to be traditional investors.
01:02:05.274 - 01:02:18.274, Speaker A: Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. I guess we'll have to all keep our eye out for the ETF's potentially down the line. Alex has been an awesome discussion. Thank you for joining us. Today and sharing your wisdom from all these cycles you've been through.
01:02:18.394 - 01:02:31.306, Speaker B: Hey, and I want to tell it, you guys, push back. Dave, you're giving me some good clap back. Like, you know, I tell people, I tell my researchers, like, I really believe in argumentation as a way to arrive at truth, that basically you have to try on arguments to see how good they are.
01:02:31.370 - 01:02:31.594, Speaker C: Right?
01:02:31.634 - 01:02:52.602, Speaker B: Like, you actually have to. That's why I like opinionated discussions. Because I don't want to say that the trope, like, strong opinions, weakly held, but it is kind of like that. Like, I think people that I'm very supportive of talking a bunch of smack and having somebody tell me I'm wrong. Like, that's. I'd much rather do that. And I'm so I'm throwing this disclaimer out.
01:02:52.602 - 01:03:07.444, Speaker B: Like, everything I said could be wrong. I'm happy if it is right. Like, come and tell me. Put it in the comments. Otherwise, been great as always. I'm a big fan of you guys, and you know you can't go wrong. Three dudes in black teas got the uniform.
01:03:07.444 - 01:03:10.504, Speaker B: Thanks, guys. Great to be here.
01:03:10.664 - 01:03:20.044, Speaker A: Awesome. And for our listeners, we will be chatting about our episodes on Thursdays and Twitter spaces. So feel free to jump on stage and chat about this episode.
