00:00:14.410 - 00:01:01.520, Speaker A: Welcome to Unlayered, the show where we explore next generation blockchains. I'm your host, Saul, alongside my co host Dave. And today we are talking to Patrick Bush, senior investment analyst in digital assets at Van Eck, and also one of the co authors of this very robust, in depth and perhaps, depending on your interpretation, bullish report for Salana titled Vanek's Base Bear Bullcase Salana valuation by 2030. It went viral and made its ways around the Twitter sphere, especially in Salana communities, in the last couple of weeks. And we are super excited to dive into the architect behind this report and all the great analysis of Salana's, I guess, longer term prospects. So, Patrick, thank you so much for joining us today.
00:01:01.890 - 00:01:09.250, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me on. It's great to be here. Really interested to have the conversation today. I love talking crypto.
00:01:09.670 - 00:01:37.660, Speaker A: Oh, 100%. Yeah, you're in the right spot, I think. One thing I wanted to start with as we talk about this topic is just how do you think about analyzing digital assets from your seat? What sorts of things do you focus on in order to try to get down to whether it's like a fundamental value or just a use case for this chain in the long run, how do you actually do this diligence process and what do you pay attention to?
00:01:38.430 - 00:02:13.986, Speaker B: Yeah, the first way to think about it is, I liken it to traditional capital structure in a company. So if you have something like some sort of tranche of where the value goes, you might have like debt equity or whatever else kind of forms those might take. I think tokens are like the next kind of iteration. They're the thing that accrues the least amount of value and is the most speculative. And so it depends on the system. Like, some of the tokens are more like securities. I don't think they're securities, but it depends.
00:02:13.986 - 00:03:20.426, Speaker B: And so some have stronger value accrual. So it's kind of like the first way in which we look at these things, and then next is we kind of like to think about, how is the economic system designed? That's one of the things I love about this space, and why I got into the space is I like, kind of figure out how things work. I like economics in general. I like incentive structures, how people, macro, utility, all the boring stuff that no one else does. But so we think about, okay, where is the token value accrual in the system? What's the token really related to? So by that, I mean specifically, there's a lot of entities that, or a lot of projects that have dual kind of structure, right? You look at a VC capital raise, what do you see? You see, like, a labs entity, you'll see a token deal, and oftentimes, the person invests in it, will get money in that equity, but that equity in that entity, that labs entity. And so oftentimes, you have to untangle that relationship. Like, how vested is that team in and accruing value to the token? There's some teams where you're like, okay, the token kind of exists as a meme to them.
00:03:20.426 - 00:04:03.340, Speaker B: It's kind of a way that they can just make the team richer or potentially even just sell the token to fund a labs entity. But really, the sweet sauce, the money all will, in the end, if it is successful, may just go to the labs entity. I don't want to out any big projects, but there are some where we're very concerned about that long term. And so going back to the value case, if we've established that, that's kind of like, the first part of the process, and then we start saying, okay, what's its economic system? What does it do? How does it accrue value? What's its capture rate? What's its mechanism, which that brings revenue to token holders, and that's, like, the basis of all this stuff.
00:04:04.270 - 00:04:28.530, Speaker A: And so how long have you guys been looking at digital assets specifically, and has your thesis changed over time? Do you guys also like other ecosystems that are maybe taking a different approach, whether it's kind of the app chain world or even just the modular world on Ethereum, or has this focus on Solana and this deep dive opened your eyes to, let's call it the more integrated approach?
00:04:29.830 - 00:05:01.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us, Vanek has been interested in crypto since 2017. The original thesis is very much like the boomer rock thesis, where everyone looks at gold and says, oh, well, bitcoin could disrupt, or just could disrupt gold? And Venk is a gold firm first and foremost. I think over half the assets, they grow, like, 80, depending on how the market is. 85 billion in assets. Well, I mean, with Salana, obviously, we ten X that value. Right? Because we were all ten x long. Just kidding.
00:05:01.050 - 00:05:45.994, Speaker B: But the original thesis of the firm was like, okay, we're going to move off of the gold standard. We're going to move to a more fiat based system. We think gold is undervalued. And then from there, once you started seeing this use case for this new basic economic system that was outside of the financial system of all the major countries in the world, you had suddenly an asset that was potentially parallel to gold with digital, right? And so that's kind of like why they started going it. So the CEO, Jan Vanek, who's been completely instrumental making all this happen, decided to invest in bitcoin and exchanges. So he began like a picks and shovel approach in 2017. Now, he wasn't of the first wave, but he definitely did it before.
00:05:45.994 - 00:06:35.898, Speaker B: It was cool for the rest of the big money class to look at this stuff like he was buying when JPMorgan was saying, they'll fire you if you have bitcoins, but that's like the genesis of this. And so what's transpired since then is just the real birth of use case for smart contract platforms. So it's always like a really interesting way which do these things, like, you have a permissionless system where not only can agreements be made, but they can be made automatically, and then you can build together smart contracts to build functionality that approximates what a company might do. And so that's like a really fascinating way. And moving from just like, okay, it's a fancy system outside of the system, but now it's something that's entirely novel, it's new, it's something different. It could actually function on its own. And so because of that, they started looking at different ways to invest in it.
00:06:35.898 - 00:07:10.690, Speaker B: Matthew Siegel, the head of research, came on in, I believe, early or mid 2021, and it became, so what for a company like us is like, okay, we want to manage people with investments who want to invest in the space. And so it began with like a managed type L1 fund, which launched in February of 2022, obviously not the most apt timing. And from there it went to a hedge fund. Like, I myself, I came in from the proprietary trading world where basically a big rich guy had a bunch of money. He'd say, here's some money. Figure out how to make money out of that money. You don't have any advantages.
00:07:10.690 - 00:08:02.194, Speaker B: Maybe like fast Internet speed line we could pay for, but that's about it. Like, teach yourself how to trade. And that's why I was at chopper and DRW, and that's why I got exposed to bitcoin in the first place, because it was that trading community, that libertarian paradigm appeal to a lot of people. And that's how I got into it. And so going back to how we're looking at these things and valuing them to us, you look at a layer one blockchain that's going to be very differently valued. That's something like a token for a DeFi project with layer one blockchain, it's pretty clear that this is like a platform. It's a platform like an Uber or Amazon or like an Apple store where you're going to have economic activity on it, and there's going to be some sort of take rate of that activity by that layer one protocol.
00:08:02.194 - 00:09:11.786, Speaker B: And so the big question is, how much will that be? One the activity on there, what will the take rate be? Why will it be a take rate? How will that work in practice? And that's kind of like the basis of all these valuations. So we value this based upon where the puck was moving. We say, hey, in seven years, 2030, whatever arbitrary period, 2030 sounds good, right? There's going to be like x amount of revenue for these end markets, whether it's like a banking business or all the financial businesses, right? We say, okay, we think maybe like 5% of those could be on blockchain, right? 5% of all the revenues could be on blockchain. Just like some percentage of all the taxis are going to be on Uber. And so we say, okay, here's what it's going to be. And then we're going to approximate some sort of take rate and that value. And so what I've done is look in the past and say, okay, look through the different blockchain explorers and some of the tooling and some of the things you've built in Doom say, okay, if you're a user coming into the system, you don't really think about paying Ethereum versus paying uniswap.
00:09:11.786 - 00:09:43.010, Speaker B: You kind of see that as one cost, right? And then, so how that split between Ethereum and Uniswap was the basis of analysis. So something like Uniswap has extremely high take rate by Ethereum. It's something like 40% less than. Look, and that's a while ago now, but it's just because the state becomes contentious. The state is valuable and dear to a uniswap, and people will pay the most for that state when uniswap trading allows you the most arbitrage opportunity. So that's conducive to a really high take rate. Long term, we don't think that will stick.
00:09:43.010 - 00:10:27.800, Speaker B: So when we have something like finance, banking and payments, it's probably closer to like a one 2% take rate, like you see, like at a credit card, maybe like a high price ETF. And then applying that same logic, we look something like Solana. Now, Solana's like take rate. When we approximated it, it's been like orca was one and a half percent. So one and a half percent of the entire cost of the transaction with the Solana. And that's just because the abundance, because the ability to have cheaper state, so that's kind of like the basis of all these things, was just like economic value, and then take free, and then within that, trying to untangle, unpack impact from our invisible knapsack of blockchain expertise, as the cool kids used to say. How that happens.
00:10:29.610 - 00:11:19.750, Speaker C: Yeah, I love the way that you guys think about it. And it's so difficult if you try and do, like, a bottom up valuation, because everything's quite. There's a lot of convexity, and the price of the underlying asset affects the TVL and affects the revenue and all these sorts of things. So I think you're going about it in the right way, which is top down which of the markets, which you think crypto could help to disrupt, and then what sort of percentage, what share do you think they could take? I am really interested in this take rate, and certainly the difference, I think, between your ETH valuation, your Salana valuation, you were assuming, I think, 20% take rate for Salana versus how much take rate there would be for ETH. I'd just love to dig into that. And why you think that ETH would be able to maintain such a high premium into 2013?
00:11:20.650 - 00:12:03.090, Speaker B: No, that's a good question, and that's something we don't know. And our thinking has definitely evolved in this. As we've seen, ethereum kind of parcel out all the different value adds of its system. So if you're, like, offboarding execution as a business, you're offboarding data availability. You logically think there's a take rate differential that would probably be unfavorable to Ethereum. So, in the original model that I written on theorem, I assumed of the value capture of l two s, Ethereum would take 10% of that, 90% of that. So if you're thinking like a funnel down from l two to l one, like a waterfall, the l two might take like, say, 2% of the end markets, and then Ethereum would take 90% of that.
00:12:03.090 - 00:13:11.574, Speaker B: Now, that really depended upon our view on how many l two s there would be. So, my background is econ, but one of my favorite classes in college was this class on offensive realism, which is like a geopolitical international relations class. And it was this guy named John Mearsheimer, who's very controversial but brilliant, and he talks in the class about different geopolitical systems. So at that point in time, it was like the unipolar moment, unipolarity, there's like one dominant power. And that was kind of birthed out of the bipolar system. It was like the US and the Soviet Union, but in past, typically you'd see multipolarity, you'd see a group of dominant countries, right? None of them were hegemons, but they're all kind of dominant, their own little spheres. And so if you apply that logic, I figured that because there was no real way for the l two s to distinguish themselves, they're all open source software.
00:13:11.574 - 00:13:50.600, Speaker B: You potentially see hundreds or thousands of l two s. And particularly if you got bridging right, rather than if you had a really good highway of connecting these l two systems of value that was close to trustless. That basically rests on the trust assumptions of the L1. Then they would be interchangeable and they would be not able to distinguish themselves. And that may or may not be true still. But that was kind of the thinking where it's like, okay, well, all these things are compete for ETH state they're going to be posting down there. There's no way to infiltrate themselves, do it on fees, but commodify the block space.
00:13:50.600 - 00:14:38.714, Speaker B: But whatever that value capture might be, a big portion might go to ETH. And the pushback is, what if it's like a tripolar system or like a pareto kind of outcome, maybe like two or three, like really dominant ones, and they should probably be able to push back against Heath and maybe even like, you know, maybe the pushback. Pushback might be like, what if Ethereum starts enshrining some. What if Ethereum picks a winner and says, like, okay, we want these like ten or five or however many to get the same kind of advantages. And those advantages might be programmatically, but they could potentially do something like that. And so that's kind of like how we think about the take rate. And so in terms of the Ethereum versus the solana take rate, that construction is entirely arbitrary.
00:14:38.714 - 00:15:02.602, Speaker B: There wasn't like some deep seated mathematical understanding of that. It was just like, okay, Ethereum taker, it's going to be this. Solana is going to be this. I think Ethereum's philosophy is that they're going to have very dear block space. They're going to go for money ness, and because of that, their block space is going to be extremely valuable. Everyone's going to want it to some extent. And because of that, they can have a tire take, right? And so the one fifth is arbitrary.
00:15:02.602 - 00:15:29.720, Speaker B: For all we know. Salon be like 100th, it doesn't matter. Right. So that's like what we thought was in line with how you see traditional systems at the very least, like Salana had to differentiate itself through price. People say like, okay, the consumer application won't bring any more users unless it's like five to ten X better than something else. That's like some kind of VC babble speak that here all the time. So I thought that would be a good starting point.
00:15:30.730 - 00:16:24.326, Speaker C: Yeah, I love the thinking behind it. I think my view is that where we've seen product market fit so far in crypto is people remaining on a single chain. And I think it's very difficult to abstract away completely the UX issues if you have to start moving around. And I think has the announcement maybe of something like eclipse changed your mind at all on maybe becoming this trifecta of winning l two s because they'll be introducing local fee markets, as you have on Salana, so you have less of an issue about high demand, increasing fees for all. And also they're using celestia for DA rather than ether one, which again is obviously a part of the Ethereum revenue. So, yeah. Has that announcement potentially changed your views on Ethereum at all?
00:16:24.508 - 00:17:26.774, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely pushed us to think more deeply about that initial question, like how many will there be? How many does there need to be? We're actually going to be talking with eclipse really soon to kind of understand all different things they've done and how we view a change in your model. But it's definitely opened up the question that we need to probably reassess what Ethereum is able to do. And I think it's not atypical. I've been hearing from a lot of people this bear case pushback against Ethereum over the last six months, and that was based upon the l two dynamic, the da dynamic, and then potentially seeing something like a high throughput layer go on top of it. And then finally it was also based upon the fact that it's like narrative formation. Who understands what Ethereum is going for? And so I think you've seen that kind of come through in price. Like ETH has kind of just been, it's been the banana on the bus race between the different fruits.
00:17:26.774 - 00:17:37.920, Speaker B: Right? Maybe Solana is the orange, Ethereum's been the banana just sitting there. Right. But yeah, that's kind of how we see it right now.
00:17:44.290 - 00:18:29.134, Speaker A: Can you talk to us a bit about, throughout your analytical approach to comparing, I guess, l one ecosystems, or you guys call them smart contracting platforms. It's probably a better term, I think one thing I see oftentimes in the crypto Twitter sphere is anytime someone brings up something like TVL, for instance, it's like you have 50 people saying, that's not a valid metric. It doesn't mean anything. And this week especially, maybe those criticisms are true. Salana did like half a billion dollars in Dex volume on TVL of like half a billion. And ETH is obviously way more and did almost the same amount of Dex volumes. And so people bring up this point of capital efficiency, which maybe that's mean.
00:18:29.134 - 00:18:56.040, Speaker A: It's not super clear to me that orca is that much more capital efficient, but maybe it is. I guess my point is, how much value do you put into something like TVL? I noticed in the concluding paragraph of you guys'report that was almost a criticism of Solana. And it's something that I criticized before, too. There's not massive pools of capital here, but perhaps we're seeing firsthand that the critics are right, I guess. How do you think about that?
00:18:57.210 - 00:19:22.746, Speaker B: No, I think TBL is incomplete. I think you have to pair it with how many stable coins are on chain. And then to the other point that people talk about is capital efficiency. So we're looking at something like a GMX versus a DydX. Like you see, there's a lot higher turnover on the dydx capital that's there versus something on like a GMX. At least that used to be the case for a very long time. So it's definitely incomplete.
00:19:22.746 - 00:19:59.146, Speaker B: But it's definitely a good rule of thumb to just kind of see how interested people are in using the chain locking value to it. But it also presupposes that the dominant paradigm is using deFi, right. If you lock it in a contract, it's counted, someone's going to be tabulating that. And how it's tabulated is also controversial as well. Do you include liquid staking derivatives? Probably not, but I think DeFi love does a good job on that. As an aside. But, yeah, I don't think it's, like, perfect, but it's a good way of saying, okay, how interested people in it.
00:19:59.146 - 00:20:24.130, Speaker B: It doesn't tell you anything about the 2030 case. It just kind of tells you what the users are today. And if the users that you're looking for and that big bowl case aren't there yet, then the TBL is kind of meaningless, right, because that's kind of how we're thinking about it. But I think at least for interchange comparisons for what we see today it kind of makes sense, but long term, not potentially.
00:20:25.190 - 00:20:35.846, Speaker C: So you mentioned before on Ethereum about its moneyness properties and that that would attract people to use Ethereum and potentially give it this.
00:20:35.948 - 00:20:46.202, Speaker B: I thought maybe it was like, it's kind of difficult for people to understand. That was my point. It's kind of tough for people to be like, oh yeah, this is obviously money. Like, duh, I want to buy this. Right? It's a bit different.
00:20:46.336 - 00:21:02.990, Speaker C: Do you have any thoughts on how important moneyness is going to be to these valuations going forward? For layer ones? What sort of is going to make something good money or bad money? And then also, how can you possibly feed something like that into a valuation?
00:21:03.510 - 00:22:01.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that last part is most important because if you start ungluing these different revenue items from Ethereum or start downgrading them, then the DCF makes less and less sense. And I've talked to other analysts about this, and it's almost like the underpants gnome paradigm where you're just like the first case, Ethereum is useful and then there's a bunch of question marks and then the next case is, it's valuable, right? There's no real certainty in how it gets there. And so that glue that holds together thesis must be some property in moneyness. And obviously, like anyone else, what's cool about moneyness in a system like Ethereum or bitcoin is that, you know, the inflation, you kind of have an understanding that this is going to be what the value is going forward. No one can censor it, no one could take away. I think it's really important going forward. I think the important understanding of why bitcoin or any of these things is interesting is because it's non sovereign money that no one can take away from you.
00:22:01.860 - 00:22:28.730, Speaker B: Someone's not going to censor you, you're not going to be sanctioned. Right. And I think what that means is that you want credible neutrality. Those are the four things ETH talks about. But the problem is that you need to have credible neutrality. Like when ETH talks about decentralization, there's a lot of different reasons why that's good that don't have to do with credible neutrality. But credible neutrality is one of the things that stems from that, supposedly, and that's one of the properties they want to go for.
00:22:28.730 - 00:23:03.080, Speaker B: So I think having the money to be credibly neutral is really important. And when you have the ability to arbitrarily change things, when things are not ossified, you kind of violate that paradigm. You don't want to be able to do that. I think the more that something becomes set in stone like bitcoin, the more money ness it has. It's clear, because you can't really look at bitcoin say, yeah, this thing's going to generate x number of revenue. You even know if bitcoin is going to generate enough revenue to keep the miners sustainable through this happening, the next happening, you don't know how many miners are going to go bankrupt in 2024. It could be a lot.
00:23:03.080 - 00:23:53.430, Speaker B: That could be like more the predictions 2024 than what's talking about. Right? But going forward, at least you know that bitcoin has money. You know that because no one's building these pie in the sky models that tell you that bitcoin is going to use for a lot of things. And so I think that's a really important discussion that Ethereum needs to have when they talk about it's like changing the way in which the structure is up to code. So it might favor something over another project, like maybe like the sovereign role of stuff or maybe like trying role of. Or maybe looking at them doing things to stop Lido, right? Like those things violate predominant neutrality. And I think a system like Ethereum, you have a lot of researchers, a lot of people who want to do better for the world.
00:23:53.430 - 00:24:31.538, Speaker B: But the problem like double edged sword is that may take away from money ness because to do better for all, they may want to change things. They may want to continually change things. And for a system of money, you don't want that going to like, I don't really think that there's anyone who's going to say it's money now, maybe in the future, probably not. I think like whole techno optimistic paradigm doesn't lend itself to that. I think he just wants people to use it to do cool stuff. I don't think there's any real push from his standpoint to make it into money, at least how I've understood him talking about the last two years.
00:24:31.704 - 00:24:56.300, Speaker C: But is there a difference between media, like a store of value, like bitcoin, hard money, and then a medium of exchange? Because I think those two things get conflated into this money ness paradigm, but I think they're two very different things. And do you think that both accrue premium, one accrues more premium than the. Because. Because potentially Solano is more of a medium of exchange, if you like.
00:24:56.830 - 00:25:35.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's hard to unwind them though in most practical use cases, at least for something like Solana. So I say that because there's potential for a lot of different token syncs on Solana. The cheap one, of course, is rent. Like, every account, every single byte stored in Solana, you have to have some sort of Solana for rent, or you have to have enough to be rent except for two years. And so I think it kind of lends itself to people pushing this narrative. Well, we want to make it a little more scarcer, dearer. But for medium exchange, it's going to be useful for doing things on Solana.
00:25:35.314 - 00:26:06.142, Speaker B: All the DeFi is probably going to be base price in. And so I don't know, is that enough to hold it together to make it, like a real medium? Like, that's a key question. And you're seeing other ecosystems kind of grapple with that right now. Optimism and arbitram in the future will have to go through, like, right now, you know, is doing that. No one talks about Adam. Adam is like, we have the SDK, we have the so what? Through IBC, we have this really system. We're trying to build the business, but no one really seems to care about this business.
00:26:06.142 - 00:26:50.846, Speaker B: The business is flawed. The business is ICs, or securing the exchange may not be necessary, but maybe Adam should be there because it's like the most useful medium exchange throughout the cosmos. Right? The downside of that, of course, is like, well, if you're a medium exchange, you're the base token asset. If people are buying other assets, they're selling. And so you're seeing like, an explosion in Kajira or injective, maybe, like, Adam's getting crushed because people enter the ecosystem by buying Adam on Coinbase or Kraken, and then they're, hey, I got to buy my meme coin. I got to buy whatever's going up and then selling it. So that's kind of like a two edged paradigm, and that lends itself to the money, this property or this medium exchange, store value or whatever that kind of happens in bit.
00:26:50.846 - 00:27:54.286, Speaker B: It's a little bit cringe to say tradfi, but think about when there's a big global financial cris, right? The first parts of that, the table is set when the company in Thailand or whatever, the emerging economy of that new world, starts borrowing in dollars. And then what happens is, the problem is when there's some sort of hiccup in the global financial system where they need those dollars. So in the first paradigm, people are selling their dollars to invest in whatever companies are over there, and people are borrowing in dollars, and it's great, right? But then when the dollar becomes dear when there's less dollars in the system. For whatever reason, there's a big flight to quality. And that money in this property kicks in and it starves those companies and countries of the dollar, and it causes melee pandemonium. Right? So applying that, I think that might be how it goes for crypto, right? Like the first order is like, okay, this is a cool token, let's get into it. This is the base asset.
00:27:54.286 - 00:28:03.560, Speaker B: Let's lend it. And then the next one might be like, okay, you see it's money in this property when shit hits the fan, right? So that's kind of, I think, a good test.
00:28:04.730 - 00:28:26.014, Speaker A: So in the report, I think one of the interesting, actually, the timing of it was interesting just because I think it was right before things really went parabolic for Solana, rather just skyrocketed in terms of price appreciation. Perhaps it was part of the reason, perhaps not. But I think one of the interesting things you guys did was you kind of broke down.
00:28:26.052 - 00:28:38.900, Speaker B: I just want to say that it burns me inside that I didn't buy any bonk or any salana before I wrote the report. And I love Salana for a long time. And it's just like, I see blanc up like 30%.
00:28:42.070 - 00:28:46.520, Speaker A: It went up 50% in one day yesterday, I think 20 x.
00:28:47.050 - 00:28:53.350, Speaker B: No, but see, I was buying the middle curve coins, so that piece is going to play out, don't worry.
00:28:54.250 - 00:29:42.054, Speaker A: Well, that's actually a good kind of segue into this question I'm about to ask, which is, I think at the time you wrote this report, some of the top gas guzzlers on Solana were know the pith oracle chainlink and some NFT stuff, magic Eden, some defi stuff. I think the current gas guzzlers are much different today, just given all the new activity. But my point is, it feels to me like this space has gotten so overheated in this past two, three weeks, it's almost like the money is looking for something to do. And one of those things to do is let me just go buy bonk. A lot of these projects that we've been highlighting, they haven't even dropped their tokens yet. They're not going to probably do it till next year sometime. I think pith just is available as of today or something.
00:29:42.054 - 00:30:08.720, Speaker A: There's one, but I guess. How are you reacting to kind of like, post the report up to now? Massive, massive spike in interest. A lot of Solana assets, especially on the long tail side, are skyrocketing. I don't want to say it invalidates kind of the thesis you guys had. But certainly it's just like, how would you kind of reframe some of the discussion you guys got into, given what you're seeing now, given this most recent data?
00:30:13.170 - 00:31:06.480, Speaker B: My first reaction is, just like anything else in crypto, it's so prone to hot money flows and memes. It's really tough to make anything of this other than people are coming around to it. Typically, people like to joke. When you see Jim Craver saying something, you take the opposite. Yes, but it's like when crypto, the time when you sell, it's not financial advice, but the time, supposedly, when you sell is when your mom texts you, hey, what's Xcoin doing? Right? And so with that paradigm in mind, it's like, okay, when Kathy wood goes on CNBC and it's, hey, like, Solana has a really high potential. She's smart in a lot of ways, but I don't think she knows anything about Solana, to be honest. I think she was just told by her crypto team, it's good and high.
00:31:06.480 - 00:31:30.538, Speaker B: Like, that tells you something. And then to your point, yeah, it's all speculative. I didn't even know this, but I have a wallet that I interacted with, like, radium and saber, God rest them in peace. And orca from, like, 2021, I saw I have a clanozor on it. And, yeah, right? It was sweet. I didn't do anything. I had, like, $200 on this, or I have probably $1,000, but whatever.
00:31:30.538 - 00:32:11.142, Speaker B: But you look at Clanosaur's value, and I think I looked at today, it was like 30, 80 floor. But if you look at clanosaur, like, in March, it was like 100, right? So I don't think you've seen the full weight of speculative froth. Another way to look at it, it's like, okay, what's the chief meme coin on Salana? Bonk, right? Probably. What percentage of that of Salana's market cap is it. Is it considerable to comparable to Ethereum's mania coin market cap? And then you say, okay, that's today. But what if. What if you go to, like, you know, no, 2021.
00:32:11.142 - 00:32:41.082, Speaker B: Like, what percentage of market cap is Ethereum's system of meme coins then? And so you have blocks up. Like, I think they looked. It was like 2500% over the month. And it just hurts inside. It hurts, dudes. But it's like, yeah, it's up 2500%, but what's the base on that? I looked at the value. I think the last time was, like, 260,000,000, fully diluted.
00:32:41.082 - 00:33:02.134, Speaker B: So think about that. Salon is, like, what, 30 billion, 33 billion. Now, I can't remember precisely, but that doesn't seem like a ratio that tells you it's like a speculative frenzy and froth. Yet, yeah, short term, definitely. You look at funding rates, anything, like it's gone off the charts. Bananas, bonkers. But, yeah, I don't know.
00:33:02.134 - 00:33:35.278, Speaker B: Think about how the valuation, the valuations doesn't change. Valuations is like, it's an exercise to glue some sort of understanding of how fundamentals of these things might work, why they might be valuable, not to give, like, a set in stone number. Right. Just kind of use that and use it as a comparison metric, and then you glue it all together with a qualitative dissection of all the different components that makes it interesting. And so that doesn't change. From the standpoint of people buying and selling, anyone's guess is as good as mine. But it seemed like there was froth.
00:33:35.278 - 00:33:55.590, Speaker B: It seemed like it was overheated. And I said that when it was, like, $37. So it's like, okay, how does it go? When's that? Let's stop. No one knows. But back to the original thing. Nothing changes the valuation. Maybe you could make an argument that is overvalued in this relative time frame.
00:33:55.590 - 00:34:30.802, Speaker B: If you look at modular versus monolithic, going back to the original question, you look at the ratio. If we just bucket. Like, if you just bucket. Modular as ETH plus, like, an L, two s, and then monolithic is, like, aptosui and Salana, the ratio has gone up a lot in the favor of the monolithics. Right? I think it's, like, you call it, like, 10%, 11%, versus, like, before the run up was, like, 5%. People have understood thesis and its value and kind of see, like, okay, this is the differentiating factor between the two things. But at the end of the day, you talk to any of the real devs are doing the same kind of thing.
00:34:30.802 - 00:34:43.778, Speaker B: Endgame eventually, to an extent. But, yeah, nothing's really changed from that. I don't know. Does that answer the question, Sal, or did I just talk about something else entirely?
00:34:43.954 - 00:35:12.238, Speaker A: No, no, that totally answers it. And I think that answer is actually something that's a view I've held for a long time, which is even dating back to FTX. Really. Nothing fundamentally changed about Salana. Like, the same stuff they've been working on and talking about, like, fire answered, making the network more robust and less susceptible to outages. That's been being worked on since 2022, and they've been making consistent progress on that front. There wasn't some crazy upgrade that changed the game.
00:35:12.238 - 00:35:58.720, Speaker A: Right. I think it's just people are coming to the slow realization that perhaps this approach to scaling is really a better ux and it's easier to use and developers are willing to use it. And I think the only thing that's changed in the last two weeks is that we're seeing, oh, yeah, it is possible to speculate and have fun, quote unquote, on Solana, because I think that's always been kind of a dig, is like, what do you do on Solana? Well, now we have a meme coin that went up thousands of percent in a very short period of time. Dex, volumes are basically top three to five now, consistently. So, yeah, no, I mean, they've really answered a lot of questions, but yet the tech is the same. So whatever thesis one had months ago, there's no reason to kind of change it up now.
00:36:03.910 - 00:36:27.160, Speaker C: Patrick, I was wondering, with the low fees and the higher relative throughput that you get with Solana, do you think that that broadens the design space and broadens the types of applications that you can build on Solana, and therefore does that increase the potential markets that it can go after and, yeah. Which areas particularly interest you?
00:36:28.730 - 00:37:07.240, Speaker B: I think it definitely does. I think it's very clear that having that high throughput design space just gives you a bigger piece of canvas to paint your killer app on. And more importantly, you want this idea of this constellation, this unified structure of applications all talking to each other and interacting. I think that's like a huge potential as offered by Salana. And where that goes, there's just so many options. I think the most interesting one is payments. Everyone's been talking about that since 2009 when Satoshi wrote his paper.
00:37:07.240 - 00:37:50.290, Speaker B: But I think it's really interesting. And I think, to me, it's like payments, and then like, what are the problems we're dealing with now? What are the problems that Venmo solves? Or fed now? It's like you have this really poor structure of financial plumbing in the current system. You clearly need something better. You need a better way of settling transactions, of payments, of value, of exchanging them. You don't need all these different entities taxing that along the like, think about all the different ways in which western Union or Venmo or block or whoever are taxing. Payments is a lot. And you compare that to Solana.
00:37:50.290 - 00:38:18.022, Speaker B: It's nothing. The biggest tax in that system will probably be like the fiat off ramp. Right. And so if you can solve for that, if you can make that cheaper and make that a big. So what I think that's like the most high potential thing, particularly if you start adding debt into a credit card debt, you start having all the different components of why credit cards work, everything from ID to the lending pools. You could do that on Salana. You can make a really high grade consumer payment experience potentially.
00:38:18.022 - 00:38:44.002, Speaker B: You can't do that in Ethereum or the L two s gnosis. Pay is trying that. Their credit card or their debit card is interesting, but I don't think you're going to have the potential network size in terms of how could work use it they do on Salana. It's not even close. So I'm interested in those two things. I think something like repo makes a lot of sense, too. You'd probably do repo like an Ethereum or l two.
00:38:44.002 - 00:39:28.258, Speaker B: Probably. But just think about, because I was like, I trade treasuries and the biggest takeaway that I have from treasuries is everybody's levered like 100,000 to one, like crazy size. Because you're basing the amount of money you need deposit as margin based upon the volatility underlying. And if you have a cash two year bond, the volatility might move, like, in a crazy day, like 1%. I guess things have gotten a little bit more volatile lately. But if you have something in a spread, like you do, the two year cash on the run cash bond versus two year future, how much money do you really need to hold the barging? How much is that spread going to really move? Not a ton. Right.
00:39:28.258 - 00:39:59.510, Speaker B: So people are effectively getting large sums of money. Where does that come from? Well, on the future side, of course, that's like the margin structure of the CME. There's no cash exchange, but the cash bond side, you need to have that. Need to have that money on hand. So you go to an entity that borrows it. Who do they get that money from? Well, people who have bank accounts eventually, right? That's essentially how the repo works. At the end of the day, you put that on chain, and suddenly you talk about people needing to hold large amounts of capital versus their crypto.
00:39:59.510 - 00:40:31.160, Speaker B: Maybe like a financial institution, they want to participate on chain, they have to hold some ungodly amount of capital. Well, right there, it's on chain. You can borrow money. USDC, you can borrow treasuries for the overnight strike period, then unwind that and send it back out. Right? So that's I think is interesting. I think just generally anything that has a platform that could just be disrupted, that takes way too much money from the transaction standpoint can be disrupted too. I think teleport XYZ is interesting because of that.
00:40:31.160 - 00:41:24.760, Speaker B: Potentially even like a helium. Helium failed in this first iteration because they went after a really dumb market, in my opinion. I say that because they looked at LoraWAn, they're like, okay, the LoRaWAN bandwidth, no one governs that, no one controls that, right? And so somewhere we can do that and it glues to iot and everyone love Iots in 2016 1718. But if you look at the implied amount of money that they would make out of that because their whole thing was like, okay, this is a low cost network for low cost devices that are extremely cheap to run and you want to charge them very little. But then they combine that together with this really expensive network that was worth 50 billion at its height. And it's like, I don't think that the underlying supply of data to iot devices will grow to be that. And I looked at a lot of different growth assumptions and it didn't seem to make sense.
00:41:24.760 - 00:41:40.060, Speaker B: But with cellular, it makes a lot more sense. It's going to be tough to bootstrap out. They've kind of shot all their tokens, but those are the things that are cool to me, like deepen something that's going to impact everyday life. And that's also probably the toughest thing.
00:41:41.390 - 00:42:36.962, Speaker A: So let's actually talk about that a bit more. You brought up teleport, you brought up helium. And broadly, Deepin is a space where it's like products and services that maybe we already use or familiar with, but we're completely changing the economics. We're introducing perhaps a token incentive to incentivize different stakeholders, whether it's on the supply side or the demand side, to come together and provide this service at a cheaper cost, ideally to the consumer. And maybe it's using some open source version of the software that normally powers this. So in the case of teleport, it's an open source version of all the software that connects drivers and riders and does the mapping and all that good stuff. So my question to you is, having worked in or analyzing crypto assets for so long, how big of a, I guess, hurdle is it really to bootstrap these initial networks? Because at the end of the day, let's talk about Uber.
00:42:36.962 - 00:43:24.400, Speaker A: At the end of the day, these are just incentives. And whether you're paying someone dollars a bonus or you're paying them in tokens. To them, it's just money. And we've seen in the past Uber kind of butting heads heavily with Lyft and just who's going to pay out bigger bonuses and be more driver friendly. And Lyft kind of in the early days was the first to do tips and then Uber kind of copied that approach and then opened it up to Uber X and so on and so forth. But that's always been the kind of the hardest part from their perspective is can you get human beings, the drivers, to stay interested and engaged and using your platform to then make a great customer experience? Do you have any skepticism around, let's try to do this, but with tokens, I guess. How do you view this thematically and how the deep end space playing out, given that it hasn't really taken off in any sector yet?
00:43:26.290 - 00:44:01.066, Speaker B: Yeah, it's easy to be cynical, I would say it has taken off, actually. I would say obviously the process for deepen, there's people running their own validators, right? Like there's hundreds of thousands. What's the number here? Like 600,000 plus. And there's tens of thousands of other ones across. And that's kind of like the first use case. But there's a cynic of me that likes it. It's a system that premises on speculation, and that's at the glue of it.
00:44:01.066 - 00:44:37.266, Speaker B: That's the core. Everything's the glue today. Sorry, a lot of vocab words, but that's the fuel that makes it run. Right? Is this idea like where you're part of this network and we have this meme that this network is going to be big one day and we're willing to invest in it in our own way, whether it's like a demo, which is not Solana. You get like a device and put in your car and it gets car data, and then eventually the car data is going to be worth a lot, but the initial part is like getting people to buy that device. Right. Helium got to a million active, but I think it probably sold more than that.
00:44:37.266 - 00:45:40.338, Speaker B: I don't know if you remember with helium they had probably sold a lot more devices, but then their third party manufacturers couldn't buy them because of the chip shortage. So helium could have theoretically been a 3 million hotspot network for its LoraWAn network. And so you have this paradigm. The idea why it's cool is that you're taking the infrastructure costs, you're taking all the capital investments you have to make as a company and putting it into the hands of people to do that because they believe they're going to get something greater of value, that the speculative token that's going to go up and make them be able to afford Bugattis or whatever, right? And so that's tapping into basic human nature. It's like the primordial understanding of how people think and want and what they want out of the world that you haven't really effectively hacked yet. And I think you're gamifying this people's emotional understanding of outcomes. And then you're glued to narrative, you're glued into construction.
00:45:40.338 - 00:45:52.780, Speaker B: And, you know, it reminds me of, it's like there's this meme brown. It's sweet. It's the one where you're a dad, you talk to your son, you're like, you're going to marry Bill gates'daughter. Have you guys heard this one?
00:45:53.310 - 00:45:57.294, Speaker A: I don't think I've seen references to it.
00:45:57.332 - 00:46:20.070, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I hope we don't butcher it. But the one is like, okay, son, I'm going to tell you who you're going to marry. And son's like, I don't want to marry anyone. Do you want me to, dad? I'm my own person. He's like, you're going to marry Bill gates'daughter. And the son is like, okay, how are you going to do that? And the dad goes to Bill Gates and goes, okay, I want your daughter to marry my son. And Bill Gates goes, oh, okay.
00:46:20.070 - 00:47:04.514, Speaker B: Well, why would I want to do that? And then the dad goes, because my son's going to be the CEO of the World bank. And then Bill Gates like, oh, okay, interesting. And then he goes to the World bank and says, I want my son to be CEO of the World bank. And they laugh in his face and they say, well, why would your son be the CEO of world bank? And dad says, well, my son's going to marry Bill Gates like he wants him. And then, so it's just like this construction of narrative that bases upon these outcomes that may or may not happen. But as these make people believe they're going to happen, to an extent, they're like self fulfilling. It's like, back to geopolitics, it's like the Thucydides trap where it's like, well, he says basically big powers have to always fight.
00:47:04.514 - 00:47:30.138, Speaker B: But that's necessarily true. But if people start believing it, they think they have to compete, then maybe it happens. And so there's this element into this, into these deep networks where if you meme it enough and people believe it. It's going to happen. Think about chain link. Chain link has been talking about all sorts of nonsense, of being involved in Swift and all these other big names since 2017. But guess what? They're making it happen.
00:47:30.138 - 00:47:57.970, Speaker B: I don't know if it's actually going to happen or if it's really that meaningful. I kind of doubt that, to be honest. But they've gotten to that point where they're talking to the CEO, the World bank, and daughter, or my son's going to marry Bill Gates daughter, put me as CEO. And now people are like, oh, yeah, okay, think about that. That's incredible. All that was done was through means. And so I think with Deepin and making these things all work, you have this potential where these things could work altogether.
00:47:57.970 - 00:48:26.618, Speaker B: Like, you could boot trap a giant deepen network. But they're fragile. It's like, why did terror stop working? Well, terror stopped working when people started selling it and they suddenly saw the emperor had no clothes. And the false vacuum point actually was not the point of real vacuum. Everything collapsed. And so with, like, that's kind of how I see that stuff playing out, is like, could it get there? I think it could. People build buildings on this paradigm.
00:48:26.618 - 00:48:50.840, Speaker B: People always talk about Trump, and Trump does this Bill Gates daughter things. When he was building real estate, no one believed him. No one thought he could do it. And then he put it all together. That's what people do in real estate, right? So it's like, why not? Why can't it work? Why can't the frogs, peoples of the world, speculate and talk about something, and eventually it happens? Because it could. It really could. And I think that's what I finally get.
00:48:50.840 - 00:49:26.270, Speaker B: And then more importantly, most importantly, is that there's like a reverse Pascal's gambit to this, where it's like you're betting on the outcome being infinity. Awesome. Why not put a few bucks on it kind of stuff, right? I think that's kind of what people are looking at for this sort of thing. So that's why I think deepen's cool. Interesting. And then the piece here is us also, that you have these structures that just seem unfair to people. Why is Uber taking 40% of the driver's money? That doesn't seem fair.
00:49:26.270 - 00:50:02.922, Speaker B: That seems absurd. Because they own a network. Because they have a network effect. Okay? What's built something better, that treats them more equitably, that puts more money in the worker's pocket, or whatever anti capitalist slogan you want to adopt? Crypto enables that you can have that you can do that, you can make it cheaper to direct people to these things. And so that's, I think, the big. So what is that you have these rent seeking, taxing entities that have enormous value, that extract value from people, users, workers or whatever, that can be disrupted. And that's, I think, like the heart of all crypto.
00:50:03.066 - 00:50:04.240, Speaker A: Very well said.
00:50:10.610 - 00:51:04.834, Speaker C: And obviously another aspect is that SaO was saying you can just pay people with money, but if you want to bootstrap a network before it exists and before there's any revenue, you need to get that cash from somewhere. Whereas with crypto, you can give away free tokens with this speculative angle associated with them. So, yeah, I think it's a genius way for capital formation to arise. How do you think that crypto is going to, how's it going to reach these 2030 levels? I suppose is my underlying question here. Do you think it's the institutions are going to come in? Is it going to be a bitcoin driven rally? Is it going to be, as you said, consumers trying to evade the 40% tax and getting over the sort of ux hurdles and the complexity that's inherent with crypto? How are we going to break through from this small little niche of people that we've been chatting to on Twitter for the last couple of years?
00:51:05.032 - 00:51:33.674, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the same thing. It's like, look at the crypto price. There's like 50 different whales trading things back and forth to an extent. There's not a ton of players, but I think it's just you get the ball rolling, like on the speculative angle. People start getting involved, people start getting interested in it. I think about my own trajectory of the space where I started in 2015. I bought some bitcoins for like $400 and I did great.
00:51:33.674 - 00:52:17.874, Speaker B: I sold them for 1000 and I converted them to Ethereum at like E .3 or something, whatever the high was. But it starts with the speculative journey, and then at some point people will start thinking, why does this have money? Why does this have value? Why is this interesting? I just traded until basically d five summer took off and I started looking into it and reading about what chain link is doing, what polka dot is doing. I actually went all in chain link. Every dollar I had. Not a went all in chain link in July of 2020, and it proved to be really bad. Not bad from the standpoint.
00:52:17.874 - 00:52:22.690, Speaker B: I didn't make money, but it didn't go up compared to, like, e. Yeah.
00:52:22.860 - 00:52:31.946, Speaker A: Trust me, you're not the first person from 2020 that in my own network that went all in on chain link and was a little disappointed with what happened next.
00:52:32.128 - 00:52:40.474, Speaker C: Yeah, it led the bull market, didn't it? I think it started before anything had happened. Really. It did, like a 20 x and then didn't really do anything when the bull market actually arrived.
00:52:40.602 - 00:53:04.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I started buying at like $4, and then Thanksgiving it was like 15, and I was like, the guy with like five whiskeys deep. That was like, guys, chain link, chain link. Look at this meme, World bank. And everyone's like, okay, all right, have fun. Go back to mom's attic kind of attitude.
00:53:06.090 - 00:53:11.820, Speaker A: What are you going to be talking about when you're five whiskeys deep? This Thursday, then that's what I want.
00:53:13.470 - 00:53:45.874, Speaker B: Probably deepen, probably the pitch to disrupt the platforms, give money back to the man. Huey Long, capitalism for the people. I don't know. I like crypto right now. Like, what gets adoption? What gets adoption? Besides the user stuff, it's this sovereign money piece that's really coming into play. Like I mentioned a little bit earlier. Yeah, right? We can talk about all the bad things that Russia or whoever did in the world, Iran, they're bad, don't get me wrong.
00:53:45.874 - 00:54:23.854, Speaker B: But if you go back to credible neutrality of a money system, you need credible neutrality. You need rules, you need order, you need to have that. And from two points, like, when you violate that credible neutrality, which the US has done, you start raising questions about the credible neutrality in that system, and people start thinking, well, we want something else. And you have crypto, which now offers you that opportunity for something else that might develop. And I think it's a huge paradigm that might start bringing active interest in crypto. It hasn't quite materialized yet, maybe it never will, but it's potentially bigger than it was before. And the other issue, the thing is that's getting popular is it's like 1900 again.
00:54:23.854 - 00:54:52.120, Speaker B: It's populism, right? There's no Williams, Jennings, Brian, or whatever his name talking about crosses of gold, crucifying us. Yet. But we're having similar talks about currency depreciation. I guess back then it was the opposite. But you're having this populist movement form people who are. Yeah, like, why am I paying X percent to this when they hate me or I don't agree with their politics or whatever. I have this other system that's like, why would I go for that?
00:54:52.570 - 00:55:34.294, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, even just yesterday in Argentina, Javier Malay, talking about moving to the dollar. So it's just another checkmark, another case in point that there's a groundswell of interest in, I guess, sounder money. And I think that's long term pretty bullish for crypto, even if in the short term it has nothing to do with crypto. We covered a lot of topics. One thing I wanted to get your take on, just as someone that's pretty plugged into the institutional world at the intersection of crypto, is like, help us make sense of whatever you want to call this bull run. I mean, it seems like an early innings of a bull run.
00:55:34.294 - 00:56:09.666, Speaker A: It feels to me like it's been driven mostly by institutional interest. It doesn't feel like retail interest is retail is even engaged that much with this. Whatever metrics you look like, look at whether it's just anecdotal, I mean, I think a few people are starting to talk about it, but still it's not quite there. Google search interest versus, like, open interest on bitcoin, for instance, hit an all time high, and the inflows just seem to be coming from bigger players. So help us make sense of what are things looking like in terms of the institutional side of crypto in this bull run, and how do you see this kind of market dynamic playing out over the next year?
00:56:09.688 - 00:57:05.854, Speaker B: Or I go to events sometimes in the city, and I go to something like avalanche, like they have like a dinner, they do a great job of BD, and I see people from institutions there. And for the longest time it was always like, oh, well, what are they doing here? There's nothing here. And I talked to them and they can't say anything, obviously. And it's just always like, well, there's nothing going on. But then increasingly you're seeing more programs, more pilots, more things that are showing that they're experimenting in the space, and they're starting to get a lot of. So what's for ways in which they can save money or attract new customers or whatever else? And so you're starting to see this play out faster and faster. Realistically, a lot of these things that they're announcing are little more than experiments or tests.
00:57:05.854 - 00:57:46.866, Speaker B: Even Visa's case, like Visa, if we unpack it a little bit, like Visa, just sees Solana as another network to settle on one of thousands. It's actually not as impactful as you'd suppose. But it's interesting that they're starting to take notice. And for me, seeing these people really get interested in it, that shows that they care about the space. I'm trying to think what else? So I think that it's good and bad for crypto, for the tokens at least because a lot of people, again, suppose that the institutions will come into the space, right. That could happen to cannot. I don't know.
00:57:46.866 - 00:58:17.594, Speaker B: Still I think it is going to happen. But the problem is they might do things in ways that do not use public blockchain systems as the art stay. They might just have a labs entity built their own kind of private blockchain or their own kind of data settlement streaming network of prices or whatever. Right. And so that's kind of like my fear. That's the bare case. But I think in terms of interest in this space, you're definitely seeing people talk about it, talk about at least investing in this is like a sovereign body.
00:58:17.594 - 00:58:50.950, Speaker B: I think. I think at the heart of it they won't say it. But I think Blackrock understands tangibly that you're violating incredible neutrality of the US based system is going to have some effects down the road and they might want to kind of diversify their offering to looking at things that people might want to invest in outside of it. So in terms of real adoption, not seeing a lot yet. Van Eck is an institution. We are doing a lot of interesting things. We have an NFT project called segment.
00:58:50.950 - 00:59:31.620, Speaker B: We have our funds, we have lots of funds in Europe. And so we're trying to push a lot of. So what? Like things that we've talked about before, everything from stablecoins, tokenization of assets on chain and for those we couldn't get a lot of. So what? But I think other players might be able to scale those more effectively than us. Right. And so I think going forward you're going to see this, but with institutions, they're just going to follow the money goes and the users are. If you get more speculative movement in price, more people come into the system, more people start interacting with it, more people start keeping money on Solana, then they'll say, well, we need to offer them services.
00:59:31.620 - 00:59:46.440, Speaker B: And I think that's kind of what you'll see going forward is slow adoption and then non sovereign money thesis play out. And then potentially like something happened that betrays token holders or they build something, it doesn't accrue value to the price.
00:59:47.290 - 01:00:18.900, Speaker C: It'd be interesting just to get your take as well on the regulation side of things because I think Coinbase have just released their KYC product on base and I know that Salana with their token 2022, that will also allow certain programs to have an allow list basically of people who have been KYC. So it feels like we're integrating ways in which you can incorporate KYC. So do you think that regulation is a big hurdle still for these institutions? And do you see that going away over the next couple of years?
01:00:19.430 - 01:01:07.026, Speaker B: It definitely is. It's a huge hurdle. Like talking to someone like Akash. Akash is doing like GPU compute stuff, right? And their biggest issue, biggest issue for a lot of stuff in general is that entities, they want to build there, they can't hold a token. Think of the corporate structure of holding a token so you can do something like who's going to be in charge of that? Is that a treasury function? Who's going to manage that? Who's going to manage the wallets? How do they justify holding that very volatile asset? How do they justify paying someone an asset? And so it's a big hurdle for a lot of people to have that. And that's like the non financial. For the financial, you start to see the solve the solution case, like decentralized identity or like a KYC list, very least.
01:01:07.026 - 01:01:46.702, Speaker B: So I think something like Coinbase having apparently 108,000,000 verified users is huge. That can be massive. But for centralized identity, we still haven't seen anything that really makes it interesting yet. But I think that could be another massive use case for crypto is this big marketing tracking. So what is where people start opting in using their wallet to be tracked, then getting paid, or by something similarly similar to demo, where all the user data is somewhere. And if you want to tap into that, you have to use that third party system. There's an interest.
01:01:46.702 - 01:02:22.886, Speaker B: There's some projects building that, but I won't mention them by name because they don't talk to me and I don't like that. But I think it's like a big. So what for the space is like, you lose tracking across the Internet when you started implementing more privacy. But realistically, how much people really care about privacy, I don't know. Probably not that much. And if you incentivize them to not be private, then think about the value of Facebook in terms of revenue per user. Imagine you're like a high value user.
01:02:22.886 - 01:02:33.680, Speaker B: You're like, I don't know, someone that provides a lot of value in YouTube. What's that split? What's Mr. Beast take rate? Is he getting a good take rate in that? I don't know.
01:02:34.690 - 01:02:39.086, Speaker A: I believe for YouTube specifically, it's like 50% or so.
01:02:39.268 - 01:03:16.566, Speaker B: 50 or 60? Yeah. A cool app that no one's built yet is like, imagine something like, I don't know. I mean, everyone's like, someone's got to build this app. It's kind of, like, douchey to say, why is no one building this? Bro? Building is hard, and I really respect builders and all the things they do, so I hope it's not taken that way. But, like, a really cool app would be like, imagine social fi, where you're gambling on people's profiles. You get to talk to them for a bit. But what if it wasn't just that? What if it was, like, cameo, where you could talk to a celebrity for a bit? Or what if you had some kind of contract way of enforcing? For me, I like to barbecue.
01:03:16.566 - 01:03:34.830, Speaker B: I like to do smoking meats and stuff. What if I was having problems with my brisket? And then I want to talk to the Franklin guy, I forget his name, the famous barbecue guy, for, like, ten minutes. Like, hey, what do I do wrong? And he got paid for that in crypto, and there wasn't some platform taking, like, 80% plus his firstborn.
01:03:36.450 - 01:03:41.250, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair. I haven't been to Franklin's barbecue. You're talking about the one in Austin, right?
01:03:41.400 - 01:03:59.590, Speaker B: Yeah, but the guy who makes this up, he has, like, a pretty rad bunch of YouTubes and smoking meat. It's such a thing. It's, like, a really difficult process, and there's so many factors involved. And I had, like, a little crypto get together a few weeks ago, and I smoked some things. Some things turned out and some didn't.
01:04:01.290 - 01:04:15.280, Speaker A: Man, I would love to go to the next one. Man. I love smoked meat, and I understand the labor that goes into it. It's hours, right? It's like 24 hours of just slow smoking it and stuff like that. The wood factors into.
01:04:16.130 - 01:04:36.882, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like the wood, the wind, the temperature, and then does the fire go out? Are you going to do it overnight? You got to prep the meat. You got to get the meat cut up good. You have to figure out the good rub you want, and then you're constantly checking it. And then I made a bunch of sides, so I made three meats and, like, four sides. I think I did collectively probably, like, 15 hours of cooking and stuff.
01:04:36.936 - 01:04:37.782, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
01:04:37.916 - 01:04:42.120, Speaker B: It's insane. Yeah. Especially hard. My wife was yelling at me. She's like, why aren't you doing work for me?
01:04:43.450 - 01:05:20.610, Speaker A: It's a labor of love, man. The meat. Yeah, but I think what you're alluding to, I live in New York, and I just don't have the patience to stick through an 18 hours cook. But I love the output, let's put it that way. I think the point you're alluding to is an interesting one I don't know the answer to, but what is the value of aggregation and curation versus the utility of networks like YouTube or cameo or what have you? Uber. And I do push back on a notion that they're not valuable at all. It's decentralized at all, and that's called a day.
01:05:20.610 - 01:05:55.760, Speaker A: I think there is some balance here. That's probably why none of these have taken off any of these decentralized social protocols or social fi, because it turns out centralization and aggregation and curation is probably most of the product, especially for YouTube. You go there to have it tell you what to watch, not to use a search bar. But I do think we are skating towards a world where that becomes decentralized. I think both things are true. It's unclear what that final product vision will be, but, yeah, I mean, it's an interesting point for sure.
01:05:56.210 - 01:06:18.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I think with. Definitely with YouTube, that's a really good point. The aggregation and then the content that you want to see, obviously, sometimes it sends you things you don't like. But I've definitely gone through some awesome rabbit holes, and it's taking me to places I want to go in surprising ways. I like synthwave. I like that I'm one of those people.
01:06:18.520 - 01:06:19.122, Speaker A: Oh, nice.
01:06:19.176 - 01:06:21.560, Speaker B: I found some cool things because of YouTube, right?
01:06:22.250 - 01:06:34.540, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And it's good at also just like understanding. All right. Yeah, I'm tired of this. Move me on to the next rabbit hole. Right? There's a lot of power to that. And we could have a whole episode just on that stuff.
01:06:34.540 - 01:07:10.920, Speaker A: It's almost like AI, which is a centralizing force, versus crypto, which is decentralizing. And for YouTube to have such good algos, it needs consistent training data, which means you stay on their platform and you browse and they connect it to Gmail and search and all. Regardless, I mean, I think we touched on a lot of really interesting topics. It's been a super fun combo. Patrick, really appreciate you coming on. Do you have any kind of closing thoughts for us as we kind of skate into what seems like the next bull run, which I can't believe I'm saying this, compared to where we were just three, four months ago.
01:07:14.730 - 01:07:47.490, Speaker B: I think it's going to be a bumpy ride. I think the political situation in the United States is going to dictate what happens next to an extent. I think there's a lot of sidewinders that could happen for both the market that we haven't thought about yet. That could be bullish or bearish, and that make sure that what you're looking at makes sense and that you set some sort of point where you have max pay and you get out and you don't let it go. You don't lose more than you can spend. You don't put your mom's money on things that go down, only up. Right.
01:07:47.490 - 01:08:20.454, Speaker B: Mom's money goes to things that go up. And you just make sure that you do your research in a way that makes sure that you understand how the token makes money and why that makes sense. And the use case makes sense. Use case makes sense. Sometimes tokens of the product doesn't mean the token will make. And I would be really cognizant of community, like, how powerful that community is. Everyone talks about Solana's community now, the cockroachers in crypto, because they had the.
01:08:20.454 - 01:08:51.414, Speaker B: They went into the extinction event and came out strong. And I think that's kind of like a good way to look at these things and just be completely aware of where you put their money. Just be sure that you're going to make the right choices, but no one does. And so I just wish you were in the best of luck. I don't want anyone coming to me and being angry because they think I like something I didn't. But it's bound to happen for sure.
01:08:51.532 - 01:08:59.362, Speaker A: Wise words indeed, though I think it also. We just have to learn through trial and error. But thank you again, Patrick, for joining us. It's been a really insightful conversation.
01:08:59.426 - 01:09:08.098, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. I'm available for $100,000 an hour, speaking fee. I do weddings, bar mitzvahs, brisses.
01:09:08.274 - 01:09:08.774, Speaker A: Oh, man.
01:09:08.812 - 01:09:10.398, Speaker B: Christmas parties, any thing.
01:09:10.484 - 01:09:29.660, Speaker C: Lock in for a breakpoint next year, then close.
