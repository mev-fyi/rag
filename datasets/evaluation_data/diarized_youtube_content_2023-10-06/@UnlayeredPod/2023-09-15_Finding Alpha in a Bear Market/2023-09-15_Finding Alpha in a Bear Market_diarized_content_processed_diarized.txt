00:00:00.240 - 00:00:12.394, Speaker A: How do you think about, like, finding projects? How do you discover them? How do you diligence them? I'm sure there's a lot of scar tissue you've accumulated over the years. I certainly have my fair share. But how do you think about the liquid side of crypto these days?
00:00:13.294 - 00:00:17.674, Speaker B: It's a great question. I mostly look for community.
00:00:18.334 - 00:00:18.774, Speaker A: Okay?
00:00:18.814 - 00:00:53.324, Speaker B: And that's why I preach community so hard, is like, it is a buzzword, but at the same time, it is, like, the main indicator that I use to buy things, whether it is a community that's already formulated or the potential of a community to formulate. And that usually comes from either a. A very, very strong founder who I can see has the ability to pivot, and who I can see has the ability to stay with it, even through the ups and the downs. That's why I bet very. I bought 55 d gods between three and ten soul. That's why. That's why I did.
00:00:53.324 - 00:01:13.370, Speaker B: Because Frank came to me, and he's like, hey, I want to run something past you. We have this idea for dust and for dead gods. Do you like it? Paper, ham, bitch, tax. It isn't working. And I saw, oh, cool. This guy has the ability to pivot, and he has the ability to be creative, and he's got a strong team around him. And the community was already there.
00:01:13.370 - 00:01:41.260, Speaker B: The community. There was, like, a lot of people that in the d gods community early just hated Frank and were mad at him, but they were still there, you know, and I said, cool, I'll take a bet on this guy. So I look for founders that are. That are. That have the capacity to either, either a, build a team really well, or b, pivot really well, or see, hopefully all of those things really well. And then sometimes there isn't even a vocal founder or anyone. But I watch as communities kind of grow and fluctuate.
00:01:41.260 - 00:02:39.828, Speaker B: You know, I think a great example right now is Harry Potter. Harry Potter, Sonic Obama, ten enu coin. You know, I was watching that when it was like a five or a $10 million market cap. And they're ravenous. They're ravenous and almost to a mentally deranged degree, ravenous. You know, it's one of the most unique things that I've seen in crypto, because as a community starts to form and take on the responsibility of the growth of the project for themselves, it almost, it doesn't guarantee anything, but it gives me so much more confidence in making an investment in something and makes me believe that it has potential and a lot of communities can do that for a short period of time, which is kind of where the nuance lies and where the, like, abstract nature of all this lies is. Some communities can be fucking loud and vocal and do all of these things for a couple months and they just die off slowly.
00:02:39.828 - 00:03:01.222, Speaker B: But some of them, when you watch them, you just have that feeling and you just know, you're like, this is something special. It's something creative. It's something you unique. You know, I was looking at the Harry Potter one at what, like five or 10 million market cap. Now it's at 50. You know, and that's probably still early, depending upon if we're in a bull market or not. You know, not financial advice.
00:03:01.222 - 00:03:38.694, Speaker B: But it's just, it's something like that that I always look for, and I always look for founders that are, like, constantly building. Because a founder that realizes that his first iteration isn't going to be perfect and is willing to pivot is one of the strongest, strongest qualities that you can ever have, especially in a market that's constantly pivoting. If you have a founder that just gets stuck on his idea and wants to keep pushing his one idea that isn't working, he could stay with it for years and it could still be not really doing much shit. So those are kind of the two indicators that I look for.
00:03:39.564 - 00:04:11.224, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I was reading Reddit the other day and yeah, they were talking about Solana, and they just, all they can see is there's this huge cult, and they just can't quite grasp what's going on here and maybe don't have the sort of intellectual curiosity to sort of find out. But yeah, I think it's those sort of signals, isn't it, that you have to listen to as an investor? Always stay curious. And if you see, you know, a fanatic fan base, look closer, because often, yeah, there's going to be some good stuff on earth.
