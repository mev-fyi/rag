00:00:01.440 - 00:00:32.830, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Gm. Welcome to this workshop around Fru combo derivatives so we can get started. We'll get right into this. So thanks for being here today. So, for this workshop, we're going to be introducing options, perpetuals and leverage, and we're going to be talking about where you can trade these. We'll go over the interfaces, things to look for, things you need to know, like risks and strategies and stuff like that.
00:00:32.830 - 00:01:48.642, Speaker A: So it's maybe a little confusing if you're first getting into derivatives, but you know, once, once you know the basics and once you play around with it, it starts to get easier. So let's get into the introduction, and then everyone will have a little bit more knowledge at the end. So what is then an option? So basically, for a small fee or a premium, they call it, an investor can place a long, which is a buy position, or a short, which is a sell position, directional bet on a crypto asset. Therefore, then an investor, or you can profit off an asset if the price rises by buying a call option, or profit off a fallen price by purchasing the right to sell the asset at a predetermined price or date with a put option. So you then have a third choice as well. You can let the option expire and only lose the premium. So if an asset rises in price, or if you're bullish on an asset, you want to buy a call option.
00:01:48.642 - 00:03:00.620, Speaker A: If you're trying to short or sell an asset at a predetermined price, you want to buy a put option. So what does this look like then? So this is just a little chart to help you. So the x axis there is showing the strike price and your profit is on the y axis there. So with a long call, which is a option contract, giving you the right but not the obligation to buy it at a specified amount, is going to be an unlimited profit. If the asset price or the market price is higher than the strike price, and then a put option, because you're going short here, this is going to be in a profit. If the strike price is higher than the market price or the other way around, the market price is lower than the strike price, you're going to be in a profit. And both of these are going to act in a way to limit the loss or the potential to the downside.
00:03:00.620 - 00:03:53.580, Speaker A: So we'll see that a little bit later. So again, a put option as the option contract, giving the owner the right but not the obligation to sell at a specified amount of an underlying asset at the specified price within a certain time. So how does this look, you know, from a profit standpoint, then in maybe another. I think this chart is good, but it's a little confusing if you're kind of looking at it the first time. So this helps a little bit. This is kind of looking at in the money and out of the money. So with a call option or option that you expect the price to rise, you're going to be in the money if the current price is higher than the strike price, and you're going to be out of the money if the current price is lower than the strike price.
00:03:53.580 - 00:05:10.270, Speaker A: So that means that maybe the strike, the price of bitcoin is, or the price of Ethereum is 1000, your strike price is 1250. If the asset goes up to 1500, you're going to be in the money with a call option, and the put option is the exact opposite. So a put option is if you think the price is going to go down in the future, you're going to want to open up a put option and you're going to be in the money in this case, if the current price is less than the strike price. Again, going back to the previous slide here, we can see that your profit again is going to be if the strike prices, if the market price is higher than the strike price on a call option, you're going to get some profit and then the opposite on the put option. So they're just inverse of each other. So what kind of option protocols exist today in Defi? And that's going to be a few different types. You got your order book marketplaces, you got your liquidity pool marketplaces, and you got your structured products where you can just buy in and you don't have to worry too much about managing your position.
00:05:10.270 - 00:06:07.040, Speaker A: So we're going to be talking a bit about some of these opyn hedge, but there's many options out there for users. I'll go over kind of what options there are at the end and then kind of how to explore these interfaces and get used to the way these options protocols look. So I just want to go over a quick options example two to kind of explain when you're going to be in the profit things you want to look for. So for this example, you're going to buy a call option. So again, a call option is when you expect the price of bitcoin or the price of an underlying asset to increase. So in this example, we're going to buy half a bitcoin at a price of 15,000, and options will always have an expiry. So you can set the expiry, maybe longer, that's going to cost you more of a premium.
00:06:07.040 - 00:06:48.698, Speaker A: In this example, we have the expiry at one month or 31 days. So the break even in this example would be around 16,800 because of the premium. Because your premium is going to increase basically your rate that you're buying, your spot rate or total cost of the options contract. So imagine then that the price of bitcoin has increased then to 17,920 since the purchase. So in this case, the option or this call option is in the money. So then your profit could be calculated as however much bitcoin you bought. So 0.5
00:06:48.698 - 00:07:37.080, Speaker A: btc in this example multiplied by the spot rate. So 17,000 1920 minus the strike price and minus the premium. So again, you can exercise this option anytime your spot rate is greater than the strike price in a call option and it would be inverse for a put option. So again, you have the option to do this before it expires. If you don't do this before it expires, then you won't receive a payout. So if you don't exercise the option, you won't receive the payout because it's just noted that you canceled the contract and you didn't exercise during that time period. So you just forego that and then pay the premium.
00:07:37.080 - 00:08:20.818, Speaker A: So the profit gained in this, if exercised would be $560 or 62%. So why use options? So there's a couple reasons why there's higher potential returns. Because again, your potential return is unlimited to the upside. It's because in a way, you're kind of leveraged more than I, you know. So say you want to buy 0.5 BTC, you only have to pay the premium, you don't have to buy the whole asset. So you're leveraged in a way, and that's what more capital efficient is.
00:08:20.818 - 00:09:00.060, Speaker A: So a one ETH call option might only cost you $200, whereas if you wanted to buy one ETH on the spot market, in this example would maybe cost you $500. So therefore it's less risky as well. So the downsides capped when using options. In the above example, the most you can lose is $200. So an ETH call option is $200. If you bought ETH on the spot, it would be $500. If it goes to $100, then you lose $400 of that and the most you can lose on your option would be $200.
00:09:00.060 - 00:09:58.710, Speaker A: And of course, with this strategy, there's no liquidation risk, so you don't have to actively manage your portfolio, you just have to be aware of the time limit that your option has in order to decide if you're going to exercise it or let it expire. So one of the biggest strategies that is used in traditional finance is the hedging side. So if you're long on bitcoin, you can buy a put option that allows you to sell your bitcoin at a favorable price if bitcoin were to crash. So this put option therefore ensures your overall portfolio from a crash in the bitcoin price so you can hedge it based on the assets that you have. If you have a lot of short assets, maybe you want to buy a call option to offset that depending on the market swings. And you can kind of take advantage of the short term market swings as well by using this hedging strategy. So that's the introduction to options.
00:09:58.710 - 00:10:27.630, Speaker A: If you do have any questions, feel free to post that in the voice lobby channel. And then I can get to that. It doesn't appear there's anything yet, so I'll just keep going. So that's options. We're also going to be talking about perpetuals and leverage. So perpetuals are basically futures without an expiry date. So this allows traders to speculate on the value of an underlying asset for as long as the contract is held.
00:10:27.630 - 00:11:28.110, Speaker A: And you can buy and sell the underlying asset at a pre agreed price, but close it whenever you deem fit. So this is similar to options, but there's just no expiry in it. So an example of a perpetual since perpetual contracts don't expire, their value can differ from the spot rate. So for example, BTC could be trading at 30,000 in the spot market, but 30,100 in the perpetual market. So imagine you place a market order to buy a perpetual futures contract of one BTC at 30,000 and it's filled by the seller. So you would put your bid onto the perpetual exchange and then it would have to be filled up by a seller. So we'll kind of get a little bit into how that works shortly.
00:11:28.110 - 00:12:32.454, Speaker A: But in this case, you're going to be long on BTC and the seller or the buyer of the short side is going to be short on it. So if we assume that the current funding rate is 0.01% and is paid every 8 hours, you'll need to pay a seller funding fee of 0.01% multiplied by the position value for your open contract every 8 hours or the next payment interval. So if after 20 days, the BTT spot rate increases to 38,000, you can close this contract and you can lock in the profit. So the one thing to note though is you'll have to continue paying the funding fee to the seller for those 20 days that you had that contract, as long as the funding rate stays positive. So your profit is going to be, again similar to the options profit.
00:12:32.454 - 00:13:43.140, Speaker A: It's going to be a difference between the spot rate minus your initial buy in price minus the premium or the funding fee, in this case of perpetuals. So if you were to buy one BTC at spot, you might earn 8000. But depending on your contract with perpetuals, if you have any leverage, anything like that, youre profit could be different. So why use perpetuals then? So it allows you or traders to hold on to leverage positions for longer durations without expiring. It gives flexibility to exit your trades at the right time. If you're on the short side, you can earn passive income through funding fees, and you can again open leveraged long short positions to offset your exposure to market risk, depending on what other assets you hold. If you hold a lot of crypto assets, you can open short leverage short positions to offset your exposure to downside.
00:13:43.140 - 00:14:46.690, Speaker A: So the first protocol I want to look at, which is probably the biggest one, is DyDX, and they offer perpetuals and leverage. So EyDx offers cross margining across perpetual accounts up to 20 x leverage on synthetic assets with no expiry and allows traders or you to go long or short on assets. So what are some of the risks with this? You can risk liquidation smart contract, oracle attacks and flash crashes. So we'll just quickly go and look into the interface here. So this is what you'll see when you go into Duidx. Unfortunately, I can't show you too much because I don't have any buying power, but just some things to note here. You're going to make your buy and sell on the left here, and then this will show you your account leverage.
00:14:46.690 - 00:15:47.050, Speaker A: So you need to be aware of your liquidation price on some of your positions and then what your margin or leverage is going to be, depending on how much risk you want to take on. But I just wanted to note here as well, this is one risk with using perpetuals or DYDX is these flash crashes. So we can see here on the chart that matic was trading for about seventy nine cents and it shot down in a flash crash to about like $0.06. So that that would have liquidated everyone who was long. So you need to be aware that these flash crashes do happen and they can cause liquidation on those assets. So you need to have some insurances against that and ensure you're not, I don't want to say over leverage, because this is pretty much going to liquidate everyone. So I'm not sure what happened here.
00:15:47.050 - 00:16:32.280, Speaker A: It caused this flash crash, but it's not good when using perpetual protocols. But this is the basic interface here. I'll show you a bit more once we get to GMX, because it actually shows you some interesting information. So the next is around perpetual protocol, and this is just a Dex that allows you to trade with leverage, short positions, and low slippage. The perpetual protocol does ten x leverage. As of right now, it's only available on optimism, whereas dy DX is on Ethereum. I believe they're going to starkware and cosmos in the future.
00:16:32.280 - 00:17:36.490, Speaker A: And again, the risks are basically the same as Dydx. So liquidation risk, smart contract risk, oracle attacks, and flash crashes. So the interface for perpetual protocol looks very much the same. You can have your long or your short positions here on the right and determine if you want to have a limit or market buy or sell, or I guess buy on both by long or short. So it doesn't show me anything in regards to the leverage position or buying power here until I log in, fortunately. So again, we'll, we'll talk more about, about that once we get to GMX, but it's fairly straightforward UI, I think maybe a little bit more basic than DyDX. So that's something to check out if you want to do a perpetual trading.
00:17:36.490 - 00:18:16.460, Speaker A: And I think the next one we'll come to is GMX for perpetuals and leverage. And as you'll see, I really like that interface on GMX. I think that's probably why it's taken off so much lately. And of course, it allows you to trade up to 50 x leverage, which is higher than perpetual and DyDX. So this is uniquely available as well on arbitrum and avalanche, whereas the other ones were optimism and Ethereum. So I do really like their interface, too. It doesn't show you any more information than you need to see your assets.
00:18:16.460 - 00:19:06.320, Speaker A: There's only four assets to choose from on Arbitrum here, and the chart is quite basic and nice. And then we can see here we can do our long and shorts on the right, and we can have our leverage slider here kind of nice as well. So we could do a buy on a long, and as we increase our leverage, our long position is getting larger. So at 50 x leverage, with $100, we'd be able to get 3.78 of exposure is quite impressive. Again, another thing I want to point out is the liquidation price here. So you can see, as we increase our exposure, though, our liquidation price is getting closer to rate.
00:19:06.320 - 00:19:36.530, Speaker A: So as we decrease our leverage, the liquidation price changes pretty substantially. So at 1.1 leverage, our liquidation price is 166. So ETH would have to hit 166 to get liquidated. If we start to increase that to ten x, it's 1143. So entry price right now is 1254. So about $100 move.
00:19:36.530 - 00:20:14.640, Speaker A: And if we increase to 50 x, it would only have to go down by $13 to get. And see, this is the power of those flash crashes, right? So matic flash crashed almost 80%. So that's going to liquidate pretty much anyone that's leveraged five x or large, or even more than that. Something to be aware of, that these crashes can really affect you. But what this does here is at 50 x leverage with just $100, that gives you 3.8 eth of exposure. So if ETH goes up to 2000, now you have 3.8
00:20:14.640 - 00:20:41.110, Speaker A: eth worth on just $100. So the potential for the upside is pretty high here. If you're able to time the market, just be aware of the risks there. So that's GMX. The last perpetuals and leverage we're going to look at is synthetix. So this allows up to 25 x leverage. And this is available on Ethereum and optimism.
00:20:41.110 - 00:21:39.290, Speaker A: And I'll just briefly show the interface here. Again on the right, we can see the long and short positions, and then again like Dy DX and perpetual, we can't see our leverage or margin until we have a position. But I just wanted to show the interface very similar again to UIDX and perpetual. Some things you might want to look at is which tokens they have, which ones you're looking at, trading, that sort of thing. Liquidity, I think dy DX is going to be the best on that, but you can find information on that on a website like DeFi llama. So now we're going to get into the options protocols. So we have Opyn or open, and that's an options protocol, and it's on Ethereum.
00:21:39.290 - 00:22:15.700, Speaker A: And they offer two products, so they have long squared Eth or squeeze, I guess. And this gives traders a leverage position with unlimited upside, protected downside, and no liquidation. So you must pay a funding rate for this position, of course, because it's an option. And then there's short squeeze or square ETH, whatever you want to call it. And traders can earn a funding rate for taking this position. And it's paid by the long square ETH holders. So there's no strikes, there's no expires.
00:22:15.700 - 00:22:47.890, Speaker A: When using open and long squared ETH always acts like at the money perpetual call option. And this provides leverage without liquidation, of course, to say you're not going to get liquidated is fine. So this protects against the flash crashes. But again, the downside risk is always going to be there. So let's see what that looks like. This is squeeze or squared, Ethan. And we can see here we have the option to go long or short on the right.
00:22:47.890 - 00:23:23.010, Speaker A: And for short, we're going to be earning a premium that's going to be paid by the long squared ETH holders. So, how does this look annualized? The return on investment is around 37.38% on a short position here. So to provide liquidity to the platform, that's. You're going to earn some premium for that. So, month return on that is about 3%. So how does it look on the long side? Then? You're going to take a long position.
00:23:23.010 - 00:24:09.770, Speaker A: So, I like this. This shows you the ETH profit or loss versus the squared, Ethan. And we can see here that the squared ETH, as of recently here, because we've had an increase in price in the last day or two, you can see that the long ETH position would have earned us 5.33%, but the squared ETH is earning 8%. So we can see we're getting a larger return on investment from a long position using the squared Ethereum. But again, we are going to have to pay a premium on that if we change the historical. Let's see how things look to the downside here.
00:24:09.770 - 00:24:40.998, Speaker A: So, in the last 100 days, a regular ETH position would have gone down 6.4%, but our squared ETH position would be down 30.43%. So this is something to be aware of. You are taking a leverage position here. And uniquely with these are. This website is quite interesting because you're not. There's no expiry on this option.
00:24:40.998 - 00:25:21.830, Speaker A: So it's a little bit like a perpetual option. So it's kind of unique in that sense. So just be aware of the specifics when you're ahead doing these investments, the charts not showing up here. Let's try a longer timeframe here. Okay. So, over the last year, you can see that Ethereum is down 67%. If you were to take a long position using this protocol, you'd be down 95%.
00:25:21.830 - 00:26:05.120, Speaker A: So with these perpetual options that don't get liquidated. You know you're going to continue to pay this premium as you hold the position. So that's the key here. The key would be to close your position so you have, you can stop paying the premium and that's where that discrepancy in price is going to come in. So you'd have to see if that leverage is going to be worth it for you. Or inversely, maybe you want to just take advantage of the shorting side. And again, if you were to provide a short position, you would have earned 38% in fee on that.
00:26:05.120 - 00:27:05.480, Speaker A: That's open. And then the last, last one, yeah, last one we're going to look at is hedgek. So this is a peer to pool options trading platform and it's on Ethereum and arbitrum and they have zero fees. You just pay the premium and the total fees are always equal to the premiums. They have no maker, they have no taker fees, there's no other fees to worry about. So as long as you're in the money with your premiums, you're going to be earning a profit. So how does this interface look? I quite like this interface and I think this is a standard options platform because it provides a period of expiration on your options, whereas open is quite a strange and unique in the sense that it's a perpetual option.
00:27:05.480 - 00:27:39.482, Speaker A: But we'll just go over the interface quick so we can see our assets on the left here, we can choose our sentiment. Bullish bearish. These ones I'm not too sure about. High volatility, low volatility. We'll just stick with the standard bullish bearish and you can set your call option here and your put option here. And there's a couple different options here as well, depending on your strategy. But say we're bullish on Ethereum, we're going to take a call option because we expect the price to shoot up.
00:27:39.482 - 00:28:57.040, Speaker A: So we can, we can see here, we can set how many calls we want to buy and we can set the strike price and we can set the period here. So if we set the period longer, you can see that our cost is going to go up because this is, this gives us the right to exercise this contract for some time period. So you know, I'm bullish on Ethereum, but it might take a while. So I'm going to set my period to 60 days and then this is my strike price or the price that I'm able to exercise the contract. So I'm going to go with a 10% increase on the strike price here. So this means that with the premium, my profit is going to be at 1456 and my max loss is going to be the premium cost. So I won't be able, if ETh goes lower than 1379, then I don't have to exercise the contract.
00:28:57.040 - 00:29:49.860, Speaker A: And the total cost in this case would be $77 for this position. So this is pretty cool because it shows you what your profit would be if ETH rose above the, the profit margin here or the strike price. So let's say ETH rose to 1600. Within the 60 days that I have, I would be in a profit of 185% or $143 in profit off on the total cost of $77. If this keeps going up to, say, 1800, I would be in a profit about 450% or $350. And again, if it goes lower than this, as you can see, my net profit and loss never goes higher than $77. So this is pretty cool with options.
00:29:49.860 - 00:30:56.560, Speaker A: I do like that it lowers or mitigates your downside risk, and I think it's going to get more popular as time goes on, as more traditional traders get into the market. This is a uniquely interesting strategy to help you manage your portfolio or hedge your revenue. So again, I do really like this interface here with the profit and loss. And again, if we switch to a put or a bearishen sentiment, you can see that our max loss would be relative to the, you know, the total cost of buying our contract and our profit, if it goes lower than this, is just going to continue. Again, if we choose a shorter position, we're going to get profit quicker. Yeah. So changing our strike price would give you a cheaper cost here.
00:30:56.560 - 00:31:42.966, Speaker A: So if we expect huge volatility in the price of an asset, our cost on this goes way down. The one thing that I guess isn't the best on hedgehog is it doesn't give you a lot of options for strike prices. I can't just put, put in here what my strike price. What I would want my strike price as offer that some people couldn't see it there. So again, I'll just go over this super quickly here. So these are your assets with hedgehog bullish. Bearishenhe.
00:31:42.966 - 00:32:38.200, Speaker A: Bullish would be your call. Bearish would be your put. And again, you can determine how many puts you want to take, what the strike price is going to be, your period, that you can exercise your contract, and then this would be your total cost here. So that's going to be your maximum loss if it goes to the upside with a put, and then your profit down here as you can see with your net profit loss, see the difference in the price in your profit as the asset price changes. So I really do like the interface here. So that is hedgek, those are the options platforms and the perpetual platforms. So what's the summary here? Options, perpetuals and leverage can be useful tools to manage and hedge your risk.
00:32:38.200 - 00:33:22.290, Speaker A: There's many good defi platforms to use. You always want to learn about the platform. You want to start small and feel comfortable before you add a real sum of money to these platforms. And you need to understand the risk, liquidation risk, smart contract risk, do these protocols have an insurance fund? How much funds are you willing to lose? Things like that. If you want to find more examples of platforms to use, there's many choices. You can visit the decentralized derivatives section on Coingecko. And here you can see all the decentralized protocol platforms that maybe you want to be, you want to check out or you might be interested.
00:33:22.290 - 00:34:01.130, Speaker A: So these are the top ones here based on market cap. So Synthetix, GMX, DYDX gains, perpetual protocols here, there's Barnbridge, here's hedgek and things like that. So there's lots to use. They might have different rule sets and things that work better for you, liquidity, stuff like that. So check these out if you're interested. Here's where you can find a list of them and I hope you learned something today. So everyone here will receive a fruit combo options perpetuals and leverage workshop oat.
00:34:01.130 - 00:34:26.860, Speaker A: So thank you very much for attending. If you have any questions, feel free again to post it in the voice lobby or you can dm me here on discord, you can send a message in the channel later on. I'm always happy to help so I hope this was useful to you and we will see you at the next workshop. Thank you very much.
