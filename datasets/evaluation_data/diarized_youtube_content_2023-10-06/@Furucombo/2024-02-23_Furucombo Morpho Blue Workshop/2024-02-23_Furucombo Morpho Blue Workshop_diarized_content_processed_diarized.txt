00:00:12.520 - 00:00:57.935, Speaker A: All right, all right. Hello everyone. Thanks for being here today for this workshop around Morpho Blue. So let's get right into it. So on the agenda today, we're going to be talking about what is Morpho Blue, what are the benefits of Morpho Blue? The different kinds of integration levels that we have on Furucombo. So right now we're dealing with Morpho version one and we're going to have a version two. So what actions are supported and what are the limitations and then what kind of strategies can you do on Morpho Blue? So we'll talk about a unique strategy, the benefit and then the calculation and then at the end we will just do a quick review of a Morpho demo.
00:00:57.935 - 00:01:26.585, Speaker A: So awesome. So Morpho Blue. So Morpho Blue is a basically a lending protocol similar to Abbe Compound Radiant. And it is unique because it's trustless. So it's a trustless and efficient lending primitive with permissionless market creation. So anyone can create a lending pool on Morpho. So this enables the development of minimal and isolated lending markets.
00:01:26.585 - 00:02:05.039, Speaker A: So each pool contains only one collateral, one loan token and a determined loan to value ratio. So this means basically that the risk is isolated to each pool. So what benefits can users or what benefits do we see compared to Abbay or Compound? Then with Morpho Blue this falls down to three categories. So trustlessness. So anyone can create a pool here. Whereas on avicompound it has to go through the foundation, it's efficient. So typically we see better interest rates and gas consumption on Morpho Blue and scalable.
00:02:05.039 - 00:03:01.455, Speaker A: So again, anyone can create a market with any kind of asset that could be an NFT token, rebase token, things like that. So lots of options here with Morpho Blue and it's pretty new to market, so we'll have to see kind of how this continues to develop. So what are the benefits for the user then? So again, higher loan to value ratios, which means a higher liquidation threshold. And this is going to be higher than competitors as well. So especially on the Wrapstake Eth Eth pool we see about a 94.5 loan to value ratio there, which is quite a bit higher than anything we've seen on Avia Compound. So and then again, better interest rates for borrowing and then again less gas consumption.
00:03:01.455 - 00:03:43.411, Speaker A: So Morpho Blue is only right now on Ethereum. So this is a pretty big one considering Ethereum gas costs are starting to rise now at the beginning of the kind of market cycle. So this is A really important factor, especially for users that have say lower funds to put in the these pools. Great. So what is available on Frucombo? Morpho. So for version one we support the Borrow tab on Morpho and we support two pools right now. So we have the collateral wrapstake ETH, you can borrow ETH from that and that's at 94.5
00:03:43.411 - 00:04:23.795, Speaker A: max LTV ratio. And we support the wrapstake ETH collateral borrow USDC and that's currently a 86% max LTV ratio. So we support all the basic functions. So deposit, borrow, repay, withdrawal and we support leverage and deleverage. So for V2 coming very soon, we will support the actions debt swap and collateral swap. So those are the only two advanced actions we don't yet support. I think most users today will find the leverage deleverage the most important one.
00:04:23.795 - 00:05:04.801, Speaker A: But this is coming very soon and we will support these in the coming weeks. Okay, and then what are the limitations that we have? So currently we have no support for the earn, that's a different tab on Morpho. That's where you're going to earn potentially Morpho tokens and then some other partner tokens. So no support for that. We do not have support on our Create mode. So currently we only support Morpho on our lending dashboard. And currently we only support the two aforementioned pools again wrapstake Eth ETH and staked Eth usdc.
00:05:04.801 - 00:06:04.383, Speaker A: But we are going to add other pools in the next release. So when we originally released our Morpho integration, there was only two pools that had any liquidity. Now there's more that are being utilized. So BTC USDT ETH wrapped eth wrapped BTC USDC, another liquid staking OS eth wrapped eth staked eth USDC and staked eth pyusd so those will be available again in the coming weeks. So these are the limitations you can expect if you were to for example go to morphoblue directly as opposed to going to furu combo. So what strategies then can we utilize on Morpho Blue? So the strategy is pretty simple. Basically utilizing furu combo, you can choose any asset to zap.
00:06:04.383 - 00:07:04.435, Speaker A: So if you don't have staked eth, you can choose eth, you can choose die, you can do choose USDC and Frucombo will zap that token into you and deposit into the staked eth collateral pool. So the first part of this is to choose your asset, deposit into staked Eth into the staked eth Collateral wrapped eth borrow pool. Then from there we can leverage long and you can unlock Potentially up to 16.1x leverage on your deposit. So again, if you go right up to max leverage, any price adjustment is going to cause you to be liquidated. So always leave yourself a little bit of a buffer that is going to depend on your, your health rate and utilization rate. Utilization rate over I guess 94% or health rate less than 1.
00:07:04.435 - 00:07:57.699, Speaker A: So typically what we'll see is stake ETH is always increasing in price because it includes the APY earned for validation. But if we see a run on the token, everybody's trying to withdraw it and sell it, we may see some price depreciation. So always be aware that there is a risk. If the price changes and you are max to leverage, you will likely be liquidated. So always leave for this one, I'd say at least 5%, maybe as much as 10% just to be sure. And there's always going to be time to react if something happens. I there's pretty substantial liquidity on this, so I doubt one or two actors will be able to change the price substantial enough to liquidate a lot of positions.
00:07:57.699 - 00:08:36.985, Speaker A: But the risk is always there. So what's the benefit then of doing this? So currently staked ETH or lido staked eth has a 3.4% return on investment every year from validating the network. So with the wrapped stake eth wrapped eth lending pool, again you can borrow up to 94.5% of your position. So this means you can borrow the ethnic redeposit more staked eth. So using fruit combo flash loans to loop the position and again you can get that maximum of up to 16.1x
00:08:36.985 - 00:09:04.865, Speaker A: leverage. So say you want to do 90% of your position, maybe it's about a 13.5 to 14x leverage, so maybe that's going to be better for you. But either way it's still a really nice investment strategy here. So and again, as I mentioned before, be aware that any price fluctuation can cause liquidation. So yeah, and okay, so great. We know the strategy, we know the benefit.
00:09:04.865 - 00:09:36.895, Speaker A: What's the calculation? So in our calculation we chose the 16.1x. Again 14x is probably somewhere around you want to sit, but we'll utilize that for this calculation. So currently the cost of borrowing on ETH on this rap stake eth collateral pool on Morpho Blue is 1.5%. So the net cost of borrowing at a leverage of 16.1. So we take 16.1 multiply by 1.5% is 19.73%.
00:09:36.895 - 00:09:57.645, Speaker A: So it's going to cost us a negative return of 19.73% to borrow these tokens to loop them back in. So with a 3.5% return from holding staked ETH and a leverage of 16.1, our APY sits at 54.74. So again, that's 3.5x or 3.5%
00:09:57.645 - 00:10:33.655, Speaker A: multiplied by the 16.1x and that gives us 54.74% APR APY. So if you deposited, say $100 and you leverage long strategy, this staked ETH pool, you can earn today or earn based on today's values 35.01%. So that's 54.74 minus the 19.73. So the cost of borrowing, so 35% over the year, that'll be a 35% or $35 increase.
00:10:33.655 - 00:11:27.433, Speaker A: Now this doesn't include any compounding, so it'll actually be slightly higher. This is in the ear, this is the APY, maybe ear will be $38, something like that. So it's a pretty nice strategy for anyone that has ETH that isn't utilizing it and doesn't want to risk high liquidation. Again, you could choose something like 10x leverage and the chances of getting liquidated are going to be almost close to zero. So unless something substantial happens. But with the staked eth token, if we do see a breach in the contract, everyone's pulling ETH out that that could cause a substantial price decrease. But again, I believe staked ETH contracts, it's at over, I want to say, 28 billion in tokens.
00:11:27.433 - 00:12:10.275, Speaker A: So something like that would be, you know, a massive market event that's unlikely to happen. So for everyone that's sitting around with eth tokens, this is a really good opportunity to earn a little bit more on that. Great. So I just want to go over quickly what the morpho interface looks like and then how everything looks on furoo combo. So this is the. I might have to connect here. Okay, so this is the earn tab, which isn't available on fruit combo.
00:12:10.275 - 00:12:57.201, Speaker A: This is where you're going to earn some vault apy, some ladder rewards and then the morpho rewards. Morpho token is not yet live, but they will be air dropping potentially in the future. So although morpho token has been farmed now for over a year, so I wouldn't expect too, too much if you decide to go into the, the metamorpho vaults, as they call These. So I think this is what most people are doing like single sided staking. So you can stake eth, usdc, usdt, things like that in different curator pools and then kind of earn that apy. So we focus more on the borrow tab here. So these are where the pools that you can utilize through combo to manage your position with are located.
00:12:57.201 - 00:13:24.955, Speaker A: So staked ETH collateral and then loan of ETH and then staked ETH collateral loan of USDC. So these are the two pools we support currently with the highest liquidity. So 3 million on the staked ETH ETH loan pool and then 2.5 million on the other one and then the others kind of go down. 1.5 million on BTC, USDT, things like that. So over here on the right we can see the borrow apy.
00:13:24.955 - 00:14:22.435, Speaker A: So the borrow APY on the stake eth pool is actually a bit higher today. So do be aware too, the cost of borrowing does fluctuate, so your rewards will go up and down depending on how the variable borrow rate is changing and then just over 5% on USDC. So USDC is a bit of a commodity right now. Everyone's borrowing that to leverage themselves in the market. So typically we see a high deposit earning potential on USDC and a high cost of borrowing there. So that's kind of how the morpho pages is set up. And then on Furucombo, of course, so if we're from the main page here, we simply go to either manage or to Lending Dashboard and then we get access to, once we're on Ethereum, all the different kinds of lending pools.
00:14:22.435 - 00:14:57.705, Speaker A: So AV2V3, compound, radiant, morpho Blue and Spark. So if we just choose Morpho Blue here we can see the different potential pools here. So Morpho Blue eth, again this is the state ETH collateral lending and then this is the Morpho Blue usdc. So the stake eth collateral. So this is the one that we don't want to use. And this is the one where we can do the leverage strategy. Of course, if you have a different strategy in mind, you can use whichever pool makes sense to you.
00:14:57.705 - 00:15:40.245, Speaker A: So here on the left we see the total supplied assets. If we don't have anything, we simply deposit. And again this is where you choose your zap. So, so maybe I only have balancer tokens. Now I can choose my balancer tokens and it'll change those tokens into wrapstake eth. So we just swap and then supply basically so you can deposit once you have opened A position you can withdraw or you can repay or borrow here. So any kind of basic action that you can take on Marvel Blue directly, you can do on Fruit Combo.
00:15:40.245 - 00:16:19.093, Speaker A: And then Fruit Combo also offers those advanced options. So how does that look? So here's just a snapshot because I don't have a position on Ethereum and I don't believe I will do that for the demo. But here's how it looks. So once we do have a position opened, we see on the right on the borrow side, we can leverage Deleverage. So once we click Leverage, that's where we we can do up to the 16.1x and then at the bottom here, it shows us our actual position. So this particular position has a utilization rate of 84% and a health rate of 1.19.
00:16:19.093 - 00:17:04.579, Speaker A: So that means we need a 19% swing in price to lower us below one health rate. Again, remember, if you are 10x leverage and the market moves 2%, that will be 20%. So that will cause liquidation there. And then this shows us our net APY and the loan to value ratio. So all the information we need to be aware of and then just how the interface is laid out. So again, if you want to perform this strategy, you would just deposit, you would then borrow and then leverage yourself up to the amount. So in the past you typically have to borrow, take those borrowed assets, deposit them back in and borrow again and keep doing that loop.
00:17:04.579 - 00:17:41.357, Speaker A: But utilizing Flash loans with our leverage button, you can just do that all at once and go up to max leverage. Great. So I hope that strategy was useful to you. I hope this is a good understanding of the things that you can do on Morpho and how to utilize furucombo to do these actions. So everyone in attendance will receive the Morpho Blue Workshop OAT and yeah. So I hope you enjoyed this workshop and thank you for attending and we'll see you at the next one. If you have any questions at all, you can reach out to us anytime on the Community Discord.

We would be happy to chat with you. So and if you have any other cool strategies that you want to see us perform or any other lending protocols that you would like us to support, we always appreciate the community feedback. So cheers.
