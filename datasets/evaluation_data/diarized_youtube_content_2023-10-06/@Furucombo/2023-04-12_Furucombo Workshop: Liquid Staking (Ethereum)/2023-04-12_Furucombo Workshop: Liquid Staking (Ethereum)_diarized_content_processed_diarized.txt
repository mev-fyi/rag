00:00:00.400 - 00:01:09.770, Speaker A: All right, welcome GM everyone. Thanks for being here today for this workshop around liquid staking. So the agenda today, we'll just go over what is the traditional staking, what is liquid staking, what protocols can you liquid stake with? How can you liquid stake with fruit combo and some examples of liquid staking and defi and how to do that with fruit combo, the risks with liquid staking, and then we'll summarize it all in the end. So traditionally, staking on Ethereum required you to stake 32 ETH and you had to run a validator node to validate the network. So there's other networks too, like Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, where you can validate as well. Basically any proof of stake network will have this system where you stake your token. So the liquid staking also applies to a lot of the other networks.
00:01:09.770 - 00:02:17.560, Speaker A: But for this workshop, we'll just focus on Ethereum, but just be aware of that. So then later on, other protocols came in, such as rocket pool, so they could run a validator on your behalf by pooling ETH together to create each node. This occurred because 32 ETH is a high barrier to entry for most. So rocket pool started out, for example, you can stake with them for 16 eth to rent a pool. And then they launched another more liquidity set up where you can pretty much stake any amount and you'll just get some derivative token back. So the downside to staking or running a validator node right now on Ethereum, this is going to change today, ironically with the Shanghai upgrade, but the asset is locked, so this can have a negative impact on DeFi because there's kind of lower liquidity. So to solve this, liquid staking was introduced.
00:02:17.560 - 00:03:20.706, Speaker A: So what is liquid staking then? So liquid staking allows protocols to validate the network, or you to validate the network and gives users a derivative token that can be traded or used in the market. So with liquid staking, you can use those funds and other Defi protocols and you can get the rewards for validating the network. So on every proof of stake, network ETH included, you're going to get some reward for validating the network. That's going to be the reward instead of mining with proof of work like Ethereum used to be. So now it's proof of stake. You stake your ethereum, you get some reward. So what protocols can you liquid stake with? Right now, the top ones are, at least in Defi, are Lido, rocket pool, Frax and stakewise I listed in terms of TVL here.
00:03:20.706 - 00:03:58.680, Speaker A: So Lido is the largest by a pretty significant margin. Next is the Coinbase wrapped staked ETH, so you could stake your tokens. Radon Coinbase. Next in line is rocket pool, then Frax and smallest is stakewise. There's a couple more underneath, but we'll just focus on these four in this workshop. So the first one is Lido, so you can stake any amount of ETH and you'll get access to Ste. This is the derivative token that's tradable in the market.
00:03:58.680 - 00:04:41.250, Speaker A: There's pools where you can use steth and get additional rewards, but you're going to get a 4.7% APR by staking your ethereum with Lido. So right now there's over 11 billion staked and there's almost 300,000 stakers. And then it will include Ethereum. You can do use Lido with Polygon, Solana and a few other networks as well. But again, the majority of funds staked on Lido is going to be on the Ethereum network. So the market cap of the staked Lido, as mentioned before, is about 12 billion.
00:04:41.250 - 00:05:33.444, Speaker A: Right now it's ranked number nine on Coinmarketcap, so it's quite large liquidity, there's quite a large amount of people staking. So again, all this stake either will be unlocked in the Shanghai upgrade today, so it'll be interesting to see how that plays out. But again, staked either will still be useful because you're still going to get the extra APR or APY from validating the network. So it's not like with the Shanghai upgrade, this is going to go away. There's still some incentive to stake it, although you could unstake it right away. So the next one in line besides Lido is rocket pool. So you have two options you can stake and run a node.
00:05:33.444 - 00:06:06.292, Speaker A: So that's the 16 ETH node validation that I mentioned before, and that pays about 7%. But we'll focus on the liquid side, which is just staking ETH where you get the derivative reth token, and that can be any amount of ETH. So 0.01, you can deposit that and get Reth back, and that pays a 3.65% APR. And again, these values can change. This is based on the last seven days, so this is what the interface looks like.
00:06:06.292 - 00:06:47.396, Speaker A: When you stake the ETH, you can choose the amount you want to provide and then you'll receive back the Reth tokenization. And that's right from the rocket pool website. Next is fracs ether, so that's paying a 5.69% and the token you'll get back from that is the SFRX eth token. And then they also run a frax eth eth token pool rate directly on their, their website as well. So we'll kind of go over some strategies with that. But this is what their interface looks like.
00:06:47.396 - 00:07:21.030, Speaker A: And you can stake the ETH directly on the Fracs finance website. And then finally we have stakewise. So they pay a 4.14% Apr. So you can stake your se two and then you get your rewards in Reth two. So once you stake, you will receive the SE two and then you'll get a different reward token for that. So this is what their interface looks like.
00:07:21.030 - 00:07:53.780, Speaker A: And then they also have a 10% staking fee. So that will be taken from the total amount that you'll receive as a fee for their service. So that'll be a reduction in your rewards. But still overall they're paying a 4.14% apR. So if you do want to provide a deposit to lido, you can do so from the fruit comma interface. There's a deposit cube on Ethereum side.
00:07:53.780 - 00:08:48.020, Speaker A: So you input any token amount of Ethereum in the deposit cube and then you'll be outputted with Stein and the APY again on that is 4.7%. So that would be basically the first step is making deposits. So you make a deposit two eth in there, you'll get two steth out. You can choose to leave it, or you can choose to provide it to a different protocol and earn even more rewards on that. And that's typically going to be the benefit of having a liquid derivative token, is to earn the APY on both staking and providing it to some DeFi platform. So we're going to look at what that looks like here. So the first option is fracs.
00:08:48.020 - 00:09:42.850, Speaker A: So again with fraCs, you can get a staking return of 5.69% and you can put that in the fracs eth eth pool, and that's going to return a 6.68% return. So therefore, if you took $10,000 and you stake half of it in fracs, because you're going to want to pool this after, right? So you're only going to want to stake half in the liquid staking, and then you're going to want to take another half of just ETH, and then you're going to want to pool that to get the rewards. So if you pool it, you're earning 5.69% on the staking and 6.68% on the pooling now the interesting thing about this is you're staking say in this example $5,000, you guarantee you're getting a $5,000 back in a derivative token.
00:09:42.850 - 00:10:19.580, Speaker A: So now you can take that 5000 plus the 5000 you put aside for a total of 10,000. So you're basically getting rewards on $15,000 worth from your 10,000. So that's quite interesting. So the average of that is 6.7% or 6.27% APY, which is a return of $940. So if we calculate that at a $15,000 total, then the real return on a $10,000 investment is 9.4%.
00:10:19.580 - 00:10:52.470, Speaker A: So it's quite good to stake in this protocol here. So the next example is Lido. So that as mentioned, returns a 4.7% and the ST ETH pool on curve is paying 3.29%. So with the same calculation, $10,000 stake, half of it, and Lido and pool your funds, you're earning 4.7% on 5003.29% on 10,000.
00:10:52.470 - 00:11:15.070, Speaker A: So the total average APY is 3.72 or return of 558. So that's a 5.58% return on a $10,000 investment. And then the last example we're going to look at is stakewise. So as mentioned before, 4.14% return when staking with stakewise.
00:11:15.070 - 00:11:40.770, Speaker A: And they have an Eth Se two pool paying 7.16%. So using the same calculation, you're going to earn 4.14% on 5007.16% on 10,000, for a total of 6.09% APY or return of 913.50. So on a $10,000 investment, that's a 9.135% return.
00:11:40.770 - 00:12:20.880, Speaker A: So again, pretty good. It's interesting, the options that you get with the liquid staking tokens. So you can also do this combination, for example the lido one with froo combo. So you can add your deposit queue with your Eth into Ste and you can add liquidity on curve to the Ste curve pool. And then you can stake those tokens read from through combo, executing this all in one transaction. So as previously mentioned, you're going to be getting a 5.58% APY on a ten k investment.
00:12:20.880 - 00:13:06.536, Speaker A: So you can do this right from fruit combo. So what are some of the risks with liquid staking then that you need to be aware of? Well, the first one is smart contract risk. Like with any protocol, with any defi, there's an option or a chance that the smart contract could be hacked and you could lose some of those funds. So that's something to be aware of. The big one, I think is the derivative tokenization DPEG and the value can change. So we could see ETH at 2500 and s or a derivative ste, any of the derivative tokens at a lower price. For example, it's happened a couple times.
00:13:06.536 - 00:14:01.848, Speaker A: Typically over time it repegs and gets back to normal again. That's not going to be a huge deal now that Shanghai is happening today and those funds will be basically not locked any longer. So the value could change because of the time value of money, but that's not going to be an issue anymore. So and then the last one is if you lose access to the tokenized asset, then you lose access to the deposited funds. So if you were to send your, I don't know, ten ste to, you know, a contract that you don't have access to, then you're going to have to come up with ten Steth in order to unlock your, your principal. So that's something to be aware of as well. So in summary, you can stake with Lido on fruit combo for 4.7%
00:14:01.848 - 00:15:02.400, Speaker A: and you can do the curve transaction to get even more return from pooling your assets rate from fruit combo and staking. Your ETH is going to give you a derivative token back such as Steth or Reth, allowing you to trade the asset even though the original funds are locked. And then as mentioned, generally Steth or any derivative token is slightly lower value because of the time lock of the original asset. And the original ETH is going to be locked until the upgrade. But as of today or April 12, the Shanghai upgrade is going to take place and all this ETH will be unlocked. So I hope that gives you some insight into liquid staking and the value of it. And everyone who attended today will receive a fruit combo liquid staking workshop oat, which is just a great design, I think.
00:15:02.400 - 00:15:21.640, Speaker A: So if there's any questions at all, feel free to post them in the chat and I'll be happy to answer them. But I appreciate everyone who's here today to watch this workshop. Thanks for attending and have a great day. Cheers.
