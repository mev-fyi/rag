00:00:09.680 - 00:01:26.330, Speaker A: Hello and welcome everyone to this workshop on ZkeVM with froo combo. So we'll just get right into it. So the agenda today will be what are Zk evms? How are they different from other L2 s? What are the available Zke EVM networks? What strategies can you do on these networks? And then just a brief conclusion or summary on everything. So ZK evms are basically a EVM network or a network that uses Zk technology. So it's a scaling solution that uses validity proofs for off chain computation, and that's secured by the Ethereum main chain. So the transactions on these Zk EVM networks or on these L2 s are rolled up or bundled and posted to the Ethereum layer one where the consensus is reached. So the validity proofs, we won't get too much into the technology, but this is useful in the sense that everything is computed and verified on chain and then it's posted back to the ethereum network to utilize the security of the layer one.
00:01:26.330 - 00:02:14.060, Speaker A: So from a security standpoint, this is really, really, really secure. This is different from the old style or the optimistic roll ups because this doesn't require any user input. So this is like the next logical step to move away from optimistic roll ups. Although optimistic roll ups are also highly secure and they have their place as well. It just kind of depends on the network conditions. But anytime you can move away from any human input, I think that's a really strong position. So how are they different from other L2s today? So the most used scaling solutions today are based on the optimistic roll up style.
00:02:14.060 - 00:03:02.920, Speaker A: So this is if a user protocol, whatever, thinks there's malicious transactions, they can flag these transactions, and then there's a committee that will review this. And if there's malicious activity, the chain or those transactions would have to be rolled back once it hits a certain point, 1 hour, 2 hours, depends on the network. I'm not sure. Each one's a little bit different. Once that limit has been hit, those actions are no longer able to be reviewed and they'll be final on chain. So this is really useful for being able to flag or look at any kind of malicious transactions. But also there's a time dilemma there.
00:03:02.920 - 00:03:44.610, Speaker A: You don't want to wait too long because then there's a slower finality and you don't want to be too short. And then people don't have time or systems don't have time to review these actions. So all the most prominent systems right now are based on optimistic roll ups or prominent networks. And this includes arbitrum base and optimism. So as I mentioned, ZK technology is a little bit different, and it involves more sophisticated mechanisms, and this improves on the underlying security of the network. So that's ultimately why we're seeing a this push towards ZK technology. So what networks are available today then? So there's Zksync era.
00:03:44.610 - 00:04:16.420, Speaker A: So this is the main technology pusher. They're the ones that have been focusing on the tech the longest. And they recently just also airdrop tokens to users of their network. So that will be likely. The main focus today in terms of strategies is how can you participate pharma potential airdrop and earn yield on the Linea scroll, polygon and Zksync networks. So next is Linea. This is backed by consensys, who's developed the metamask.
00:04:16.420 - 00:04:49.070, Speaker A: So they're a really big figure in the space as well. And they've developed their own ZkevM. There's scroll who have also done a lot of research and technology development in the ZkevM space. And then Polygon ZkevM as well, which is also really, really prominent. And they're working towards their ag layer, so they're slightly different. And then also we see other protocols utilizing their stack, similar to how we see other networks use. Optimism.
00:04:49.070 - 00:05:13.686, Speaker A: So those are the four main ones that we're going to talk about today. There's other less discovered or in development ZKE evms that are listed here, as well as many more. But there's Astar. So they recently switched from their POS system to the Polygon stack ZkevM. There's a mutable Zkevm. So this is a gaming network. And Manta 2.0
00:05:13.686 - 00:05:59.230, Speaker A: will also switch to the polygon stack in the future. Currently they're just using an optimistic system, but I would imagine that many networks will start to make the switch to ZK technology once it becomes readily available and easy to transition. Okay, so here is the summary of the Zksync error network currently. So we're sitting at around 180 million, at least that's what DeFi Llama says. We're getting a different number from L2 B, which is saying 1.55 billion. So we're seeing bridged over 46% native assets, 54%.
00:05:59.230 - 00:06:47.554, Speaker A: So my guess is that's the token. The native amount is going to be the token there. We say daily TPS, so daily transactions per second at 1330 day transaction count at 20 million. And we also see in the kind of the pie chart there, the different security mechanisms that are in place. So state validation data availability is in the green, meaning that this is kind of already applied and working. Sequencer failure is yellow, so there's some errors or issues there to have it being 100% and then proposal failure exit window are things that aren't yet implemented so they're in the red. So overall Zksync era is about a 2.5
00:06:47.554 - 00:07:41.660, Speaker A: out of five on the security pie chart here. So that's probably one of the best that we're going to see today. And then in terms of top protocols we see sync swap at 54 million TvL, this is their top Dex and we see zero lend as their top lending protocol at 22 million and I believe both the sync swap zero lend support only zkevms or L2s in general. We also see slightly down the list is uniswap v three at 8.5 million and pancakeswap at 7 million. So we see mostly Dex actions being used on ZK sync era at the moment, but we'll see how that develops. So strategies on this network include checking the recent airdrop so you can do that at claim zknation IO.
00:07:41.660 - 00:08:23.050, Speaker A: Always, always double check that you are using the correct URL. There's lots of phishing scams double check on the official social media. Don't just trust the link that's been posted here. Future airdrops also may happen, so you want to have continued DapP usage, maybe three to five transactions per month. You want to be able to bridge on and off the network. Generally bridging on the native bridge is best and then you would want to delegate your recently received ZK tokens or vote on proposals in the future. So those are good places to start for Zksync era.
00:08:23.050 - 00:08:53.510, Speaker A: Yeah. Next we have Linia. So Linea is sitting at 1.35 billion TvL. We've seen a huge increase in TVL since the launch of their campaign and we see most of these assets being canonical or external assets. Daily TPS is just below five and 30 day transaction count is 21 million. So we see transactions count on Linea and Zk sync as being pretty close to the same.
00:08:53.510 - 00:09:26.796, Speaker A: We see state validation and data availability in the green, so same as Zksync era. However the sequencer failure is in red so we get a 2.5 or two out of five for the security validation of the L2 here. So top protocol on Linia is zero lend by longshot. So this is their lending protocol. Similar to aveav three. Renzo is the next protocol at 268 million.
00:09:26.796 - 00:10:03.562, Speaker A: And this is their liquid restaking. Mendy Finance is their third. And this Mendy finance is only available on Linea, and they're 150 million just shy of Nile exchange is their top DeX, and that's at 73 million. So this network has mostly lending DeX and liquid staking. So what can you do, or what do you want to do on Linia, then? So, recently, they launched something called Linea voyage, the surge. So the surge is going to run for six months, or until 3.3 billion TVL is on the network.
00:10:03.562 - 00:10:32.450, Speaker A: So currently we're just under 1.5 billion. So we're about halfway there, although I imagine it'll take a bit longer to complete this next leg up on their campaign here. So you'll earn points, which you can then earn an airdrop in the future. And this started on May 16, so we're about a month in possibly five more months. I doubt we see another five months. We'll probably hit the 3 billion TVL before that.
00:10:32.450 - 00:11:18.260, Speaker A: So the best ways to participate in the surge at this present time is to bridge funds, deposit assets into lending protocols, and trade on dexs to create volume. So you want to hit that threshold of bridging assets, you want to deposit the lending protocols, so you're locking funds up in the network, and then you want to trade on dexs to create some volume. Those would be my top strategies for participating in the surge. All right, so next we have scroll at 440 million TVL. Layer two. Bead chose them at 733 million TvL. We got about a 50 50 split between canonical and external assets.
00:11:18.260 - 00:11:52.852, Speaker A: TPS is just higher than three, lower than 3.5, so 3.3, we see 30 day transaction count at 9 million. So about half of linea and half of Zksync era. We see the state validation and data availability in the green, and sequencer failure, proposal failure, and exit window in the red. So we get a security rating of two out of five on the pie chart. The most popular protocol currently on scroll is a yield platform, so trenches yield.
00:11:52.852 - 00:12:27.392, Speaker A: This is a liquid staking platform, so 200, just shy of 250 million TvL. Next is pencils protocol. So this is a farming protocol, 62 million ambient their Dex at 42 million. And then we have two lending protocols. Ave layer Bank, 23 million and 18 million. So currently they're promoting a potential airdrop for on chain usage. So similar as the others, you're going to want to bridge to the network, you're going to want to use Dapps.
00:12:27.392 - 00:13:27.500, Speaker A: So deposit into lending protocol, you're going to want to create volume on the Dex, you're going to want to liquid stake, use any kind of derivatives platform if available, possibly buy some nfts, play some games, run through their smart contracts, things like that. And then lastly is voting on any kind of proposals. If we see a snapshot vote, you'll want to vote on that with your tokens if possible, depending on what kind of tokens they're using for governance at the moment, because they don't have any tokens available yet. And lastly, we're going to talk about Polygon zk V Evm. So polygon zk EVM is a substantial decrease in the TVL compared to the others. So we're only sitting at about 15 million at the present time. Layer two beat is showing 135 million, so 98% canonical.
00:13:27.500 - 00:14:16.500, Speaker A: We see a very, very low TPS, currently at 0.23, and we see a low transaction count as well, compared to the others at 566k transactions. So we're quite early on in polygon zk EvM. They've had some development issues going forward, but the technology is quite robust. I expect to see things moving along here shortly. As I mentioned, as I will mention in the next slide, they've assigned a bunch of tokens for developers, and they've also stated in the past that there's no reason that a protocol that already has a token can't do another airdrop. So they are looking at potentially providing some benefits to users on their ZkebMdeM.
00:14:16.500 - 00:14:46.774, Speaker A: So on our security pie chart we see state validation, data availability, and the proposal failure in the green, and sequencer failure and exit window in the red. So we get a three out of five on the pie security pie chart, which is the highest that we see today in terms of top protocols. We see quick swap. So this is a DeX, this is a derivatives platform. You can also farm and do some staking there as well. So pretty much everything you can do. On Quickswap we also see balancer number two at 2.5
00:14:46.774 - 00:15:32.390, Speaker A: million, TpL, and that's DeX, and then dolomite lending protocol at 1.6, and then gamma liquidity manager, which is managed through Quickswap. Anyways, so I'd say Quickswap is probably the one thing you want to do on the network right now at a bare minimum. So what kind of strategies can you do? As I mentioned, it's early in its evolution, we see low TVL, so there's a high probability of being an early user here. So that comes with many benefits. So there's many new protocols to come to polygon Zkevm with a billion tokens assigned to developers over the next seven years. So strategies I would use today is bridge.
00:15:32.390 - 00:16:24.530, Speaker A: You could even bridge on the old POS polygon chain and you could also stake polygon tokens there. We've seen some airdrops from that you want to use dapps. So quick swap for sure, maybe deposit to dolomite. You want to lend and stake and you want to interact with governance. So overall the strategies are pretty similar. You could if you, for instance, had $4,000, you could put $1,000 to each of these protocols to play around, use on chain defi dapps, and then kind of continue to do that until network reaches maturity and you can partake in potentially airdrops points, things like that. So in conclusion, there's no best ZKe EVM network to use.
00:16:24.530 - 00:17:18.280, Speaker A: Try to use them all and perform strategies on all the networks once they are mature. Look for the best and highest yields on blue chip protocols. So ABBA for example, you want to use deposit there and take advantage of passive incomes. And then we want to know what networks would you like to see through combo launch on? Let us know in the comments section below or in the community discord. We'd love to hear from you on this and here's some references. So defi llama and L2 beat really, really good resources for determining TVL security risks, what applications users are using on chain, things like that. So if you are looking for more information, you can check out these websites and dig more into the different options that they have available for you to check out.
00:17:18.280 - 00:17:28.860, Speaker A: And that will be it for this workshop on Zkevm with fruit combo. So thank you very much for being in attendance. I hope this was useful for you and we'll see you at the next one. Cheers.
