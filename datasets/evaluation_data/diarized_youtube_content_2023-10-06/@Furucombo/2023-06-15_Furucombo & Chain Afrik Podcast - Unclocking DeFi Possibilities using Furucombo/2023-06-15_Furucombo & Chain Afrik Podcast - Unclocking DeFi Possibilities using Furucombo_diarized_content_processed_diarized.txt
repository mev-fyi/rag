00:00:10.680 - 00:00:21.610, Speaker A: All right, so just a very quick one. We've done, like, 15 minutes out of the 1 hour we have to spend on this call. So, Plaza, can you quickly introduce yourself?
00:00:23.910 - 00:01:17.150, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So, yeah, I'm the community manager with fruit combo. So I've been working with through combo for just over a year now, helping on the marketing side, business development side, that kind of thing. I got into crypto in about 2017, and I actually heard about it on my birthday. I read about bitcoin, and then, you know, bought some bitcoin that day because I, you know, I felt like it was such an interesting thing to be a part of, to kind of, you know, be giving power back to the people. As I explored things at the time that the market really wasn't that robust. But, you know, as days went on, started to realize this thing, like, oh, there's ethereum, there's this thing called smart contracts that's being built on top of it.
00:01:17.150 - 00:02:00.100, Speaker B: You know, it gives you the ability for, you know, to create, you know, daos for people to work together. So it kind of expanded on the idea that bitcoin was creating to kind of, you know, again, bring power back to the people to do things in a mathematical, decentralized way that wasn't, isn't possible with today's governance. So that just really spoke to me. And so, you know, over time, I just worked hard to kind of find a project that I could work with, and that ended up being froo combo. So I can go into a bit of what froo combo is, if that works, or I can pass it back to you there.
00:02:00.680 - 00:02:02.020, Speaker A: All right, sure, go ahead.
00:02:04.120 - 00:03:02.140, Speaker B: Okay, cool. So, yeah, fruit combo is a bit unique. It's a platform that kind of combines all the decentralized finance products into one to try to be kind of an interface for all these different applications. So furu combo has, it's a proxy system that allows you to execute transactions on it for all these different platforms. So, for example, if you want to do a swap on a decentralized exchange, such as uniswap or sushiswap, you can come to fruit combo. You can click to enter a cube into the chain of transactions and then choose uniswap, and then you can perform a swap, approve, and send it right on the froo combo interface. So, basically, froo combo allows you to chain together transactions and then execute it in one.
00:03:02.140 - 00:04:03.180, Speaker B: So you can chain maybe five or ten swaps together, and then you can send those, and it'll execute one transaction. So the benefit of that is you can just come to fruit. Combo two, learn the one interface instead of having to go to all these different websites and learning their interface. And then it makes it easier because you can just add these cubes, you can, instead of sitting there over and over and over and doing twelve transactions, if that's what you're trying to do, you can just do that in one transaction. So we also have something called the multisen. So that helps like daos or projects that want to do airdrops or yourself. If you want to send one token to multiple wallets, you can add the multisencube and you can send it, you can paste in all your addresses from a spreadsheet, a CSV file, or you can just add all your addresses manually, save it to the, there's a little place to save your addresses, and you can just send all those tokens to your addresses, things like that.
00:04:03.180 - 00:05:00.188, Speaker B: So we're just trying to make it easier for people to use, to get involved in decentralized finance and use all these different products. So we got lots of options, like trading on decentralized finance exchanges. Our big one is like lending protocols. So we partner with Aave, and then we also offer their flash loan feature, which isn't available unless you know how to code. So with the Flash loan feature, you can do like advanced position management, and you can do arbitrage. So what arbitrage is, is you can take a flash loan and you can do some swaps on exchanges, and if you're in a profit after you pay the flash loan back, you get to keep the principal. So that's a little bit tricky right now, because that side of the market is covered a lot by bots.
00:05:00.188 - 00:05:51.280, Speaker B: Now, previously you could do this a lot more, but it is still possible to get profit from arbitrage. So that's one thing that people try to do with the flash loans, and then the other one is the position management. So that's one that we're trying to push a lot harder. That's the one that has the most success rate. So this allows you to take a flash loan and kind of manage your position on a lending protocol. So typically when you make a deposit on a lending protocol, you can borrow some collateral from that deposit. So if, say, you've used that collateral in another protocol, maybe you're staking some funds on curve or on another liquidity pool, and you don't have those funds available, but you want to pay back your balance, because maybe you're getting close to liquidation.
00:05:51.280 - 00:06:48.240, Speaker B: So if you're getting close to 100% or I guess it'd be around 90% utilization or your health factors getting close to below one, then you could be liquidated. So you're going to, or the lending protocol will automatically close half of your position and use some of that funds to bring your health position up higher or your utilization rate down. So one thing that we offer is the, like deleverage, it's called. So it uses flash loans. So you borrow those funds, I'll just mention. So with flash loans, basically what it is is you can borrow any amount of funds, but you have to pay it back at the end of the transaction. So because fruit combo allows you to chain these transactions together, then you can use the power of flash loans that wouldn't otherwise be possible.
00:06:48.240 - 00:08:04.348, Speaker B: So with the deleverage, for example, you borrow the flash loan, you use those funds to pay back your collateral position. You take that collateral position that you, or you pay back the collateral position, you withdraw your deposit, and then you use your deposit to pay back the flash loan, because on a lending protocol, you have to deposit more than you're borrowing. So you can use your deposit to pay back the flash loan because it's going to be higher than the flash loan that you borrowed to pay back the debt. So you're going to make about 30% off the top because your deposit's going to be higher balance. And then that just allows you some advanced tooling to say, hey, I'm about to get liquidated, I'll just close the position using a flash loan and then maybe reopen a position in the future instead of getting hit. I think the fee for liquidation is about five or 10%, so you're going to save 5% rate off the top there. So and then there's other advanced tooling positions, like you can deposit and borrow in one transaction.
00:08:04.348 - 00:08:43.720, Speaker B: So instead of making a deposit on Ave and borrowing a transaction later, you can do that in one transaction. And then you can also do debt swaps and collateral swaps. So that's like the biggest tool that fruit combo has to offer is that advanced functionality with, with flash loans. So there's lots of other stuff that we do. We are available on like six different chains. So ethereum, arbitrum, optimism, phantom, avalanche, and polygon. And each chain kind of has different functionality based on how much depth there is in the ecosystem.
00:08:43.720 - 00:09:29.410, Speaker B: So whereas like on Ethereum, we have like mev protection, we have fruit combo funds, which is like a fund manager system. We have like an invest mode where you can go in and you can choose just pools or farms that you want to put your tokens in that earn you some return, you can just click those one click into that pool and start earning. So on some of those other chains, those features aren't available. So it really just depends how robust it is. So with Ethereum, that's kind of ethereum and polygon, that's like our spawning ground for, for trying these new features, those are going to be the most robust. So that's kind of a quick overview, I hope, of what fruit combo is.
00:09:32.510 - 00:10:01.878, Speaker A: All right. All right, Blaser, thank you for their insightful introduction and for the fact that you said you came into crypto on your beta, actually wonderful. And you are able to buy bitcoin on your birthday. I think that should be the best birthday gift you give to yourself. That, and I stroll for, for combo, because that's where I call it. Combo. Yeah.
00:10:01.878 - 00:10:44.342, Speaker A: I've actually known fairy combo for a very long time, though, because I myself have been in this phase too, for a while. And I've always known combo for, for each flash loan features, you know, at the height of everything, when everyone was talking about flash loan, and I think how people could make flash loan demos through writing some kind of codes. Right. Well, it was very difficult for non technical people. It was very difficult for non technical people. Yeah. And girls, when I discovered for a combo, as of then, it was solely built on Ethereum network.
00:10:44.342 - 00:11:21.930, Speaker A: Yeah. It was not cross chain by then. The first launch was on Ethereum blockchain. And since then, trying to check out the platform and all that and making so many mistakes and not succeeding. And I'm just happy that combo is on six different chains, you know, like. And they have more innovations right now. So seeing, um, a project that you've been a huge fan of right, from scratch and coming like years later to come and check it out and it's evolving and everything is making sense.
00:11:21.930 - 00:11:43.326, Speaker A: So good lucidity combo team. And actually love the work they are doing so far. All right, so how we do it. How we do it in this space is this. We, we always have an agenda for the space. Yeah. Questions will love you to answer and discussions and thereabouts.
00:11:43.326 - 00:12:32.780, Speaker A: And also we also have on a section whereby we get to, we, we get to get questions from our community members spending on the time we dropped this particular advert for this space. So lately people have actually been sending their questions they would love you to answer directly. So it's going to be done in two segments. So we discuss with you then next one, we're going to discuss the community questions, I've checked them out. They are more than five, or I think, due to time. We'll definitely do just five after we're done with our discussion so that people who sent those questions across won't be angry and they won't be bored as well. All right, so, Zaya, welcome back.
00:12:32.780 - 00:12:33.920, Speaker A: Can you hear me now?
00:12:36.950 - 00:12:38.550, Speaker C: Yeah, daddy, I was hearing.
00:12:38.630 - 00:12:44.290, Speaker A: All right, so I think the. What did you say?
00:12:46.390 - 00:12:49.006, Speaker C: I said my network connection is all enough.
00:12:49.198 - 00:13:09.850, Speaker A: Oh, okay. You were trying to tell us something about the fire before you cut off, so you can just briefly tell us that. Or we moved to the. To the agenda every day. And as for meet Blaser from. From Fury Combo and Blazer, as well, meet Zaya, one of the core team members of Chain Africa.
00:13:13.030 - 00:13:13.526, Speaker C: Hello.
00:13:13.598 - 00:13:15.450, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a pleasure, man. Hello.
00:13:16.350 - 00:13:34.120, Speaker C: Yeah, same here. Same here. I was, generally speaking, I think I missed some parts of what you said, but I think I got. I think I got. I got that. It's on six different chains. I mean, four combo is built on six different chains and with different functionality, actually.
00:13:34.120 - 00:13:52.800, Speaker C: Then also, you talked about gathering transactions and processing them in the batch, then also multiples. Yeah, I think a utility for daos in that perspective. Then we talked of flash loans, so, yeah, I think that's, that's.
00:13:52.880 - 00:13:53.544, Speaker A: That's cool.
00:13:53.592 - 00:14:39.392, Speaker C: That's really, really cool. And, you know, all these things are aspects of defi that we cannot neglect. And if there are innovations here today, I'm really happy I'm here to be particular of the information that is being disposed today. So Defi, as we know it, is very broad. It's very, very broad. And like I said earlier, it's what propelled a lot of people in this demography to actually be part of the web3 ecosystem and cryptocurrency at large. And, you know, well, if there are tools out there, if there are services out there, there are utilities out there, innovations out there to help people driving the defi sector, then really open to here and extend them as my capacity, light permits.
00:14:39.392 - 00:14:42.500, Speaker C: So it's really great to be here today. Plaza. Thank you.
00:14:45.440 - 00:15:10.000, Speaker A: All right. All right, Zaya, nice having you. All right, so that hits the ground running. And don't forget, you can always check out for a combo. Handle is being up here. You can always check them out, follow them, and get to know what you're doing and get to know what they are building as well. They are building as well.
00:15:10.000 - 00:15:27.970, Speaker A: All right, so let's keep going. So haven't had the introduction about for a combo and, and the rest of them. So plus, can you actually tell us some of the functionalities, like the core functionalities about fury combo?
00:15:31.910 - 00:16:04.296, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. For sure. So yeah, so I'll just start with saying with fruit combo. If there's anything you need questions on, we have a really robust docs. So if you just go to our docs dot Frucombo dot app or go to the main site, lots of tutorials to help you get started. We got videos, we have written tutorials anywhere from beginner level all the way to advanced. And then anything you need, any kind of transaction you're looking at doing, you can use those docs.
00:16:04.296 - 00:16:40.870, Speaker B: It's very step by step. The videos explain everything. Some of them are 50 minutes long for, you know, flash loans, advanced flash loans, how to set up combinations with create mode, how to use invest mode. So if you spend a little bit of time, you can unlock the power, the composability of furu combo. So jumping back to kind of the core functionalities. So the main one that we started with at the beginning is create mode. So that's the one where you can click the cube.
00:16:40.870 - 00:17:23.058, Speaker B: You bring up all the decentralized finance products that are available and then you can add a cube and then you can start chaining them together or you can just use one cube. So you got the decentralized finance exchanges. Like Uniswap, we have integrated like one inch and Periswap. So one inch and periswap are unique in that they are a Dex aggregator. So you're going to get the best price using that queue. So what an aggregator means is you've got 30 different dexs as a part of that aggregator. So if you say want to swap Ethereum to USDC, you use periswap.
00:17:23.058 - 00:18:10.846, Speaker B: Boom, they're going to give you the best price based on those 30 or 40 exchanges that are part of Paraswap. So that ensures that if you're coming to fruit combo, you're going to get the best price on your swap. So that can help with things like arbitrage or just ensuring that you're getting the most efficiency out of using our product. So swapping, you can wrap or unwrap tokens if you have Ethereum or whatever the native token of that chain is. I think Avax and Polygon are the only two that aren't using native Ethereum right now. So you have that functionality. You can send tokens to different wallets and you can use the multisend feature.
00:18:10.846 - 00:19:04.430, Speaker B: So the multisend feature is cool in that you know, you can import off of a spreadsheet or a CSV file and send to as many addresses as you want. Really, it'll be based on the maximum block size of the network. So, you know, you might be limited to 50 or 75 addresses that you can send to, and then you'd have to break that up into different transactions. But if the block size could handle it, theoretically you could send to 10,000, 20,000 addresses out at once. So that's a really powerful tool. Not, not anything that I've seen built in a front end. I know a lot of projects will do like a Merkle tree contract where they send it to, you know, everyone via, send it to everyone through like an airdrop style with a, with a contract.
00:19:04.430 - 00:20:10.720, Speaker B: But that's something you're going to have to build on the back end. So the way we've designed our product is let's set up something where you can create something on fruit combo without having to code. So we've developed this front end, we've integrated these features that aren't available without knowing how to code and giving it to the people on froo combo. So that's where this idea of flash loans came out. Well, it's great if you can take a flash loan, you can do some arbitrage on the network, but most people can't code or haven't learned, haven't gone through the product, the training to do this right. So to create a flash load contract, you know, you probably, it's not super difficult, but you're gonna have to do a weeks, maybe more of training. And the thing with the flash loan contract is you have to code each contract anytime you want to do a flash loan because you're going to be targeting different exchanges, you're going to be targeting different tokens.
00:20:10.720 - 00:21:05.706, Speaker B: So while you're sitting there writing up a code to get take advantage of some arbitrage, you know, likely a bot or someone else has already jumped in there to take advantage of it. Now it's not super easy again to do it on Furu combo, but it does give you that quicker option to, boom, bring a couple cubes in. I'm gonna flash loan, you know, three ethereum, I'm gonna swap that ethereum to dai, swap the dai back to ethereum. And oh, this is interesting. I'm in a little bit of profit after I pay back the flash loan, boom, send the transaction, you know, get three, $5, $10, whatever in my wallet. So it gives users kind of that option again, there are some difficulties with doing the flash loan arbitrage, that that hasn't been our main focus for a few years now, but that option is there. So again, going back to our main feature, which is the lending stuff.
00:21:05.706 - 00:22:02.730, Speaker B: So if you're involved in lending, then you're going to want to take advantage of fruit combo's advanced tooling. So we just dropped a new feature called the lending dashboard, and that allows you to take a look at what positions you have lent on compound or aave, and you can manage those positions right from our lending dashboard. So you can de leverage, you can debt swap, you can collateral swap, you can borrow position, you can deposit, you can withdraw. So all those features, anything you can do on the lending protocol and more you can do on fruit combo, because if you go to have it, you go to compound, you're not going to get that flash loan feature, you're not going to have that advanced functionality. So that's our biggest thing right now. And then you can bridge tokens between any of the networks that we have active. So we have a Stargate bridge.
00:22:02.730 - 00:23:00.800, Speaker B: So if you want to swap tokens from any of the chains that we have, you insert the Stargate cube, choose which asset, and then you can send it to any of those, those networks. And the cool thing with that is you can bridge, you can chain transactions with that too. So you can say you want to swap Ethereum to a different network, but you have a bunch of assets in your wallet, just add a swap cube for all the different assets you have to Ethereum, bundle that ethereum together, and then you can send all that ethereum to a different network at the end of the transaction there. So again, the power is in the composability and the bundling. And that's the main functionality around create mode is basically focusing on that drag and dropping. It can get pretty deep, pretty advanced, because you can kind of add as many cubes and create as many combinations as you can think of. And that's kind of our main functionality right now.
00:23:00.800 - 00:23:54.074, Speaker B: So on some networks we do have invest mode. And invest mode is pretty simple. If you want to earn some return on your funds, you can deposit into a pool, right? A liquidity pool, maybe on curve or on Sushiswap or uniswap, earn some trading fees. So invest just allows you one click into that. So you could theoretically do that on create mode too. You could, maybe if you had Ethereum, you could swap half of that to USDC. So now you got half ethereum, half USDC, you can add liquidity onto curve maybe if you go into the curve three pool, btc ETH USDC, and then you could stake those funds so you could set up a transaction where you do that on fruit combo or just go to invest mode.
00:23:54.074 - 00:24:43.640, Speaker B: Choose. Okay, I want to deposit. And this is the cool thing about the invest mode is you can choose any asset that you have in your wallet and it'll one click into the pool. So say you're depositing into a Btc eTh USDC curve pool and I only have ethereum in my wallet, so I choose input amount or input token Ethereum, maybe I want to deposit three into there and enter into the curve pool. It'll automatically swap over those two other, the ethereum into the two other assets to make it 33% of each of those, and then deposit into the pool for you. So you don't have to worry about, you know, ensuring you have the correct breakdown to enter the liquidity pool. 50 50 or 33, 33, 33 or 25.
00:24:43.640 - 00:25:20.800, Speaker B: It'll automatically just do that for you and enter you into that staking fund there. So that's the basis of invest mode, just to make it really easy for everyone to get involved. And I know if you first come to fruit combo, you might feel a little overwhelmed. There's a lot of utility, there's a lot going on. But as you watch some of our videos, check out our tutorials, just play around a little bit. You can do all these actions without sending the transaction out. You know, drag some queues in, just get familiar with the interface, it starts to really make sense.
00:25:20.800 - 00:25:52.370, Speaker B: And then we have our third product, which is Frucommo funds. So this one's pretty cool too. Anyone can spin up a fund, a fur combo fund. And that's just like an asset management pool. So like chain of free could set up a fund and then everybody could deposit into that fund. And then chain of free could decide how they're going to manage those funds. So say you got $10,000 to manage.
00:25:52.370 - 00:26:45.356, Speaker B: You can use any of the functionality on Furu combo to manage the funds. So say, okay, we got 10,000 USDC, I'm going to, you know, buy some eth, I'm going to deposit that into liquidity pool. We're going to earn some trading fees, we might make a deposit in the ave. Now with this deposit we can maybe borrow some funds, leverage a little bit, leverage up to two x 2.5 x. And you know, if we expect ethereum is going to go up from here with that leverage, we can kind of earn more than we wouldn't otherwise be possible. So you can put, like, someone who's a understands training, a little bit more advanced to manage people's funds, right? So maybe just in your family, you know, there's someone, you know, that's really good investing, you can deposit with them.
00:26:45.356 - 00:27:21.760, Speaker B: They can manage this fund on fruit combo and help to earn the family, you know, rewards or whatever the case is. So the fruit combo funds just opens up the ability for you to deposit with someone who's more trading savvy and to just say, hey, I want to get exposure to the market. I trust this person. I trust these guys to manage my funds, and they're going to work for me. So on the other end, for the fund manager, you can charge some management fees, or you can charge performance fees. So management fees are always going to be static. Say I choose 1% management fees, I'm going to earn 1% a year regardless of my performance.
00:27:21.760 - 00:28:10.530, Speaker B: And then there's performance fees. So I could charge 10% performance fees, and. And I'm going to earn 10% of the profit that that fund makes. So if I make 100% in a year, I'll earn 10% of that plus the 1% on the management fee. So there's incentive for the manager to be earning for the people that are deposited. And then on the other side, there's, if they're an advanced trader, they have a history of making good profit, I can just put in with them and watch my money grow instead of having to worry about managing. Managing my position myself, because there's things you got to do, like, if you're going to invest in Abby or invest in compound in the lending protocol, you have to ensure you're not going to be liquidated.
00:28:10.530 - 00:28:40.700, Speaker B: You got to be watching your fund if you're utilizing your funds to the maximum, if you're pretty close to that liquidation every day. Right. And there's huge market swings, like, have been going on lately. So I can put my money again with someone who's checking this every day. I don't have to worry as much as I would if I'm in a fund with someone else who's. Who's mad, who's managing that on my behalf. So that's kind of the third product we came out with recently.
00:28:40.700 - 00:29:28.980, Speaker B: Right now, fund is just available on polygon, but we are looking to increase that capability. Kind of adding more cross chain stuff as we go on. Yeah. So that's kind of the difficulty with fruit combo in the sense that we have all these subchains, these L2s these side chains that are. It's kind of making it difficult right now, but we're working hard to ensure that we can bring the most capability to everyone on any chain that they want to be on because, you know, ethereum's great, but not everyone wants to pay 30, 40, $50 transaction fees every time they do a swap deposit to a pool. So, you know, maybe you want to go to polygon instead or something. That's going to be a lot cheaper.
00:29:28.980 - 00:29:59.100, Speaker B: The problem with that is maybe the liquidity is not that great on Polygon as compared to Ethereum. So there are trade offs depending on how much your funds you're bringing into the market. So you kind of got to be aware of what works best for you. So I can. That's, that's the existing products that we have right now. I can talk a bit about what we're building, but maybe we'll do that in the next question.
00:30:00.680 - 00:30:25.196, Speaker A: All right. All right, Plaza. Thank you. That was a whole lot of information. Like, tons of information dropped in a few minutes. That was wonderful. All right, Susaya, any contribution? Any comment? All right, I think, um, Zaire is having a network issue blazer.
00:30:25.196 - 00:30:44.580, Speaker A: Let's just keep riding because time is not really on our side. And, uh, my car, today's Champions League final, I don't know. I'm not sure. But pretty sure that hula persons actually will want to watch the Champions League and all of that. But that's, by the way. Right. Let's keep moving.
00:30:44.580 - 00:31:21.950, Speaker A: All right, so you haven't, um, told us, um. Um, the functionalities as a core functionalities of, um, for recombo and how people can actually do a whole lot. Right? So. And, um, if those different stuff, a lot of people might be wondering, and they always want you to answer this question so that they can actually get something. Right. And that question is like, what are the benefits of using Fourier combo for efficient defi interaction to other benefits for using the platform?
00:31:25.010 - 00:31:43.700, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. So, yeah, yeah. So there's a few benefits. The first is, yeah, you don't have to learn these interfaces of all these protocols on Ethereum. I think we have about, I want to say, ten or twelve or 13 different integrations.
00:31:43.700 - 00:32:37.516, Speaker B: So uniswap, sushiswap, one inch periswap. You don't have to go to all these different websites, learn their interface, learn the intricacies, learn which tokens are being swapped on there. You can do that all on fruit combo. With just learning our interface gets a bit more tricky with the lending protocols like compound Abba. Again, you can do that all very easy on fruit combo with the lending dashboard. So that's the main benefit is just once you learn froo combo, you unlock the composability and we're the ones that are bringing in, we're adding these protocols, we're seeing what people want and we're adding that functionality. So you always feel like you're on par with maybe all the other traders.
00:32:37.516 - 00:33:35.060, Speaker B: Because when you come to fruit combo, it's, we've done our research, we've added products that people want, that people need to do advanced DeFi trading. And you may not know of a protocol that exists that's on fruit combo that people or people are using and making money with. And when you come to fru combo, you say oh, hey, this is neat, this is new, let's use this, let's try it out because I understand the interface and now you're getting the benefit of that. Now you're using that new product that you might have not known about previous to that. So that really just helps people into the market that are maybe feeling a little overwhelmed, a little confused. You can start getting involved in this defi trading pretty easy, especially with the tutorials and videos. We really try to make it easy, break it down for you.
00:33:35.060 - 00:34:00.010, Speaker B: That's one of the benefits of furu combo. So the other one is, again, we have an active dev team. We try to bring all those new products to the table, ensure that everything on fruit combo is what people need. We want to try to be the one stop shop for Defi. It is difficult. There's a lot of protocols. We're not going to be able to integrate everything right away.
00:34:00.010 - 00:34:41.690, Speaker B: It may take us some time. We may not even be able to integrate the feature because of the way through combo works. So froo combo is a proxy system. So it sits as a contract between the handlers or the different protocols that we integrate. So when you send a transaction through froo combo, it goes to the proxy, gets routed to the handler to perform the transaction, and then back to your wallet after that. So some functionality as it sits right now can't be done through a proxy and then that limits us a little bit to what we can do. So that's the only kind of downside to the proxy system.
00:34:41.690 - 00:35:20.440, Speaker B: But there are more benefits than negatives. And of course we're always working to ensure that we can bring as much product to the people, that we can work around these negatives, because Furukom was one of the only proxies whereas a lot of protocols, it's like, okay, we're on a different chain, there's no lending protocol. Oh, we'll just copy Uniswap's code or the sushiswap code. So with froo combo, you can't copy anyone. There's no one working on a proxy system. There's no one building what we're building. So we have to think about it in depth.
00:35:20.440 - 00:36:05.280, Speaker B: We got to develop it from scratch, we have to get it audited. We got to think about what might happen if we do something right. So it requires a lot more thought, a lot more in depth discussion on the back end to give you a clean product on the front end, something that's going to be easy to use, functional, that kind of thing. So the other benefit is, again, we can provide advanced tooling that isn't possible without the use of furu combo. So going back to flash loans, again, this isn't possible unless you know how to code. So with fruit combo, you can use this advanced functionality because you can chain transactions together, you can do arbitrage, you can do advanced position management. So that's a huge benefit.
00:36:05.280 - 00:36:49.060, Speaker B: Now, the third benefit I'll talk about, which is something we're developing right now, it's going to be available soon. It's called the composable router. So right now it's difficult for a protocol or even a user to develop something on fruit combo because our API is closed. You would have to work in part with the team. The design isn't that easy to work with. So we've created something called the composable router, which will allow anyone who knows or can do typescript to develop contracts. So you do not have to know how to use solidity.
00:36:49.060 - 00:37:41.450, Speaker B: You can use typescript and you can code your own functionality onto froo combo, and you can create your own cube, you can create your own trading bot. Anything that interacts with the contracts on furu combo you can create on your own end. The composable router is open to only the person that approves that contract. So there's no security risk to the rest of the user base who's used froor combo proxy. So this is going to open more doors. It's going to be more of a benefit to everyone who is building on it or using froo combo, because for example, with the composable router, someone could build a training bot. Now everyone can approve and use this training bot to maybe automate arbitrage transactions on fruit combo.
00:37:41.450 - 00:38:23.408, Speaker B: So maybe that person who developed, the bot can charge some kind of a performance fee for using that. Every time a transaction gets processed through the bot, they can earn 15%, and then it's a win win. So maybe that person who created the bot gets 15% off that transaction, but that person who did the arbitrage still gets a profit. So now it's a win for the person that created a win for the person that found the arbitrage, which is automatically executing with that bot. So this is going to open up the door to more benefits once we go public with the composable router. And I think that's going to be the biggest thing. So we've been working hard on that for just under a year, and we should release that later this year.
00:38:23.408 - 00:38:40.550, Speaker B: So again, the benefits are ease of use on a easy to use interface, functionalities that aren't available anywhere else besides fruit combo, and then now unlocking even more capabilities with the composable router would be the third benefit.
00:38:42.330 - 00:39:19.658, Speaker A: All right, blase. I really appreciate those amazing contribution of yours. Right. I love the fact that you stated benefits and you also give us some kind of risk involved. And I love the fact that everyone can always, can always customize their own functionality and do everything they want to do, right? So there's a whole tons of benefits, right, that comes with the combo product. Yeah, of course. I love calling it combo.
00:39:19.658 - 00:39:54.100, Speaker A: So there's main reason why I love calling this particular project combo is when you get like, um, combine the whole blocks, right? Because I think I told you earlier, I made the project at its early stage, right when it was just launched on Ethereum chain. So it just gets like, put a whole lot of block. Either you swapping from, um, um, from uniswap, or you're doing something on one inch and all of that. So. Or even on, um, there's this one other SDE, um, decks there. Sushi swap. Yes, sushi swap.
00:39:54.100 - 00:40:32.208, Speaker A: Or paraswap, whichever, which of them that you're doing something on. So you just get to keep stacking the block, and that is where the combination comes in. So after that is where the project drew its name from, the combo. So you just have to join everything till it's making sense and you'll be able to do a whole lot of stuff. So nice, nice, nice, cool stuff. All right, so, um, actually, you actually speaking, um, a whole lot of persons are coming to the core, and people are living and all of that people are coming, and someone who is also dear to me actually hopped into the space. And I'm smiley as I give her a shout out each time I see her on city.
00:40:32.208 - 00:41:05.080, Speaker A: When I count my blessings, I count that twice as well. So I really appreciate and thank you for joining us this wonderful evening. Yeah, it's myly welcome. All right, so let's keep writing because time is not on our side. As I said earlier, we've actually discussed about the benefit and we just want to, we just want to get a bit into technical stuff. Then we come back. We come back to.
00:41:05.080 - 00:41:39.190, Speaker A: We come back to the audience question. So the first question I actually want to ask is this. Yeah, we've actually had about the benefits and all of that, introduction strategies and all of that. So we want to ask this question. So what are the common challenges or questions users might encounter when using on fury combo? So what are those challenges? Or what are the questions users might actually ask? Why using fury combo?
00:41:41.940 - 00:42:08.550, Speaker B: Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah, I mean, there's. I think the most common issue is people setting up cubes incorrectly. So exam, for example, they may not set up the flash loan cubes correctly for what they're trying to do. They may. So when you're performing an arbitrage on froo combo in the top left, it's gonna say either you will receive or initial funds required.
00:42:08.550 - 00:42:44.866, Speaker B: A lot of times people will see that you will receive and think, okay, this transaction is in profit, but they go to execute and it says it's failed. And then they can't understand why it's failing. So a lot of times people will add like a borrow cube. And what a borrow cube is, is it allows you to borrow from your deposit on Aave. But if you don't have a deposit on Abby, you're not going to be able to use the borrow cube. But when you put a borrow cube in, in the top left, it says you will receive. So people will put the borrow cube in.
00:42:44.866 - 00:43:24.390, Speaker B: They'll say, hey, I'm in profit here. But the transaction is not executed. So a lot of the times that's the core problem is how people are setting up these combinations that may not work. So we are always available on the discord, on our telegram to answer any questions, to help. I always advise people to start with the tutorials, especially the video tutorials. They're done by myself. I try to go very in depth into any issue or problem and break it down to the lowest denomination as possible so that you can understand each step of the way.
00:43:24.390 - 00:44:17.880, Speaker B: The introduction to create mode is a really good place to start to just try to understand how you want to get started. What kind of trades you want to make, how you want to get involved in the market, how you can start making your money, you know, put your money to work and earn some, some reward for you. So the biggest problem I think is setting up the combinations. A lot of the time someone will set up a combination correctly. But there are some intricacies with certain cubes. For example, with the Dex aggregator cubes, if you're chaining together in a certain way, it might not work. Like for example, if you're doing ETH to USDC and then you're going to swap back USDC to ETH and you're going to keep doing that over and over.
00:44:17.880 - 00:45:24.910, Speaker B: It may look like you're going to generate a profit in the end, but what happens is when it goes to execute the first transaction, ETH, USDC, the pool itself is going to change its value. You're going to lose some value on the swap or lose some liquidity that the liquidity in the pool is going to change. So USDC to ETH, for example, you're going to pull more ETh out of the pool and you're going to make a deposit of USDC. But what happens on fruit combos, you've changed this together twelve times the price. Oracle isn't picking up this chain and the change in the liquidity because the, the liquidity change isn't executed yet on chain. So it's never going to work for you to chain together twelve of the same transactions back and forth because you've not yet changed the liquidity in the pool. So once you do that, maybe with one swap you'll notice, oh, hey, this isn't profitable anymore because I've changed the dynamic of the pool so much.
00:45:24.910 - 00:46:16.426, Speaker B: So like price oracle, price changes through an oracle or price changes on the network aren't going to be seen by linking together all these similar transactions. So that's one that people have a problem with. There may be some issues with price slippage that you need to adjust, you need to allow for that. So we have a document called troubleshooting flash loans. It lists all these problems that people have, and I do talk about that in our flash loan video as well. I go through each of those problems that people have and then talk about how to fix it. I talk about how to set up a combination that's going to earn you money and I show you combinations where people have earned money.
00:46:16.426 - 00:46:55.200, Speaker B: So again, the videos are the best place to start. And the troubleshooting docs, or our docs are also another good place to check out. So we try to minimize all those issues that people would have. And again, because of the, you know, the dynamics, we try to. We're always looking to ensure that people are having a good user experience. If someone's having a problem, we'll update the docs, we'll update the interface to make it easier. So again, the biggest problem is just failures in the create mode combination.
00:46:55.200 - 00:47:38.040, Speaker B: I ask you to come to the discord or check out our docs. There's likely something that you can adjust to make the transaction go through, and it can get pretty complex, especially with the advanced trading features, like if you're going to manually, and you would have had to do this before we introduced the lending dashboard, but now with the lending dashboard, you don't. But if you're going to manually set up a debt swap, collateral swap, it's seven, eight, nine different blocks, and they have to be in a specific order. You have to use add funds or return funds, which is an advanced functionality. It can get a bit confusing. So I had one user come to me. He set up a combination, couldn't figure out why the transaction was failing.
00:47:38.040 - 00:48:17.186, Speaker B: Everything was set up appropriately, or so he thought. But he was, he was doing a debt swap on a compound transaction, but he was using an Avay block in there. So once we switched the avay block with the compound block, then the transaction executed. So again, if you have a problem, come to us. We're always willing to help. That's what we're here for. And, you know, hopefully everyone comes, they have a good user experience, but if there is a problem, yeah, that's, you know, having good support is half the battle, and we'll get you through the problems that you're having with your transaction.
00:48:17.186 - 00:48:41.260, Speaker B: But I'd say that's really the biggest one. That's the two biggest things, I guess, are setting up combinations incorrectly or having errors, or just the first main step of understanding how the platform works, getting involved, I'd say those are the two biggest things. So again, we've created nice docs, nice videos to help you learn how to get involved and get involved in this awesome world of defi.
00:48:43.160 - 00:49:10.532, Speaker A: All right. All right. That was amazing. That was amazing. Like you listing those problems and you listen how they can as well be tackled and so friendly. I know any product or any community or any project that actually want to drive. If you're building something technical, right, you're building a product that people get to use.
00:49:10.532 - 00:50:12.066, Speaker A: Of course, you need to like provide a 24 hours support system, because in as much as possible, you think everyone is technical or everyone is not technical. You, the people always come around to ask those questions and how they can as well solve one or two problems. Just like what you said so far, that someone had a problem or the problem was it was actually using another block instead of choosing another block. In a situation like in a case like that, people get to panic and be like, oh, this stuff is not real, this stuff is fake, and blah blah blah, stuff like that, they forget to ask for help. So it's very cool that the combo team provided a whole lot of stuff for community members. So you can always ask for help in any area where you stalk and you'll be bailed out. All right, so we've done 1 hour already.
00:50:12.066 - 00:50:56.220, Speaker A: Our space is always 1 hour due because of our audience, and some people have other things doing. So we'll quickly jump onto the community questions, then we get to do some as time goes on, probably we get to spend like more ten minutes here or 20 thereabout. So we have a question from our co host. It seems like he's having a network issue. We should have asked this question himself. So the first question is this, seeing that furu combo is integrated on multi chain so far, what blockchain is the most favorable to the utilities that fury combo presents in the deaf? Rspace?
00:51:00.200 - 00:51:34.110, Speaker B: Yeah, no problem. I'll try to be a bit quicker with my answers here too, just to help speed things up. But yeah, Polygon and Ethereum for sure. So Ethereum, we have the most integrations, and then Polygon, we have the most functionality. So Polygon has the invest mode, it has the fun system, Ethereum has the most protocols added to it. It also has the invest system, but it does not have the fund system. So of course we're always looking at expanding functionalities to the different chains.
00:51:34.110 - 00:52:22.360, Speaker B: The reason why we started with the fund system on Polygon is because it's a lot cheaper to execute the transactions, right? If you're doing, if you're managing a fund on Ethereum, it's going to cost you 30, $50 a transaction. We want our fund managers to be able to perform transactions to change their portfolio easier without having to worry about those fees. So on Polygon, you're only going to be incurred 1020 cents maybe per your transactions. So it's going to be a lot cheaper, a lot more accessible for people to get involved, especially if you're spooling up a fund that's of lower value. So yeah, Polygon, I'd say, provides the most breadth of diversity, but Ethereum is kind of the deepest integration that we have currently.
00:52:24.500 - 00:52:42.120, Speaker A: All right, awesome, awesome, awesome. Cool. So we, we have another question from the comment, then, while I go over to the questions that were sent over the week, the next question is this, what demography utilizes fury combo the most?
00:52:45.900 - 00:53:17.140, Speaker B: Oh, that's a tough one. Yeah. So the safari combo is developed out of Taiwan, so there's a pretty strong, you know, asian market support. Also, there's a lot of people out of North America that utilize fruit combo. We have a pretty large United States audience. And then actually Africa as well. And then India, I'd say, are the top for.
00:53:17.140 - 00:53:50.072, Speaker B: We do get a lot of people out of Russia, Ukraine area too. So I would say those are the top five, although I'm not 100% sure on the latest demographics. But those would be the top five. And. Yeah, and then the other part is, what kind of transactions are these people doing? Right. Like, which demographic is doing what kind of transactions? That would be another interesting thing to look at. But yeah, I would say those are the top five.
00:53:50.072 - 00:54:09.540, Speaker B: So it would be the kind of China, Taiwan area, North America, so Canada, United States. We have people out of Ukraine and Russia and India and then Africa, but I'm not exactly sure which areas in Africa, but those would be the top five.
00:54:10.640 - 00:54:41.608, Speaker A: All right. All right. Awesome. Awesome. I love the fact that Africa was actually included in the list. So probably in your subsequent research, you get really know where are the volumes coming from? Is it from, um, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Cameroon, um, even Algeria or Tunisia or even Egypt? Because I know a lot of people in Egypt as well, are doing marvelously well when it comes to crypto. So that is awesome.
00:54:41.608 - 00:55:12.104, Speaker A: So that is awesome. Really appreciate those amazing, amazing contributions. Right, so. All right, so we, we have tons of questions, right, that we've, that we've collected over the week and we can just do all of them. So probably do. Probably do some which are important. Like, we just need to select the questions based on priority.
00:55:12.104 - 00:55:38.420, Speaker A: And the ones with you there should be, should be held out here while other ones can actually wait. So from the list, I have this particular question, and the question is, how does fury combo ensure transparency and accountability in its operation? Are there any audit or third party assessment conducted on the platform smart contract and security measures?
00:55:41.750 - 00:56:16.350, Speaker B: Yeah, that is a, that's a great question, for sure. Yeah. So we have, we have on our docs page our audits list. We have extensively audited. I believe we've done twelve or more audits. They're all listed there through different reputable parties. Certic DDob, chainsalting the, there's a PEC shield, there's a huge list there of audits that we've done, again, because of the depth of a proxy, how we can't just copy someone else.
00:56:16.350 - 00:56:53.350, Speaker B: This is new cutting edge technology that's not being done or built by many protocols. We have to really think about security, and security comes first in that manner. So we do also have a active bug bounty with immunify. So if you're looking at the fruit combo contracts, you discover a bug. We offer up to, I believe it's a million, 200,000 in bug bounty if you find something. So we always appreciate the white hat hackers as opposed to the people that just go and exploit the contract. So if you do find something, take advantage of that bug bounty.
00:56:53.350 - 00:57:58.170, Speaker B: As far as I know, we haven't had any one take advantage of it yet. We do take serious consideration into security and ensure we have all those audits in place. But that is always there and available to you. If you do find something, reach out to the, go to our docs, go to the bug bounty page, fill in your information into immunefi, and we'll work with you on fixing that particular issue to ensure that our product is safe and, you know, people can't get taken advantage of. On the accountability side, frugal combo did transition to a dow, I believe it was a little over a year ago. So using the combo token, not even if you don't even have the combo token, you can come in, you can make a proposal, maybe your proposal is to add a protocol, then with your combo tokens, you can vote on that. If there's enough support for that from the community, we'll integrate it as a team.
00:57:58.170 - 00:58:38.938, Speaker B: So also, earlier in this year, the DAO, or members of the community, voted for Furu combo to charge a small fee on the initial funds, for example. So now those initial funds are transferred into a treasury, and the treasury is managed by the community. So the community can decide how they want to move those treasury funds, if they want those treasury funds to be part of a fund or something like that. So all of that is managed through the Dow. So that's how we're kind of dealing with the transparency. If you have combo tokens, you can get involved. Anyone can create a proposal on the Dow and get involved.
00:58:38.938 - 00:59:21.326, Speaker B: And then we're always, of course we do in house community calls. We talk about what we're building, what's coming next, any issues that we've had, anything that we've worked on, every year. We do, like a year analysis, talk about how many people have performed transactions, how much volume has gone through the protocol. So we always try to be as transparent as possible. You know, we're living in this new kind of paradigm where things are switching towards a decentralized manner in this space. We don't want to create this central entity that's keeping things away from the people. We want to just be as transparent as possible, as easy to talk to as possible, and have everything on the table there for people to see.
00:59:21.326 - 00:59:26.890, Speaker B: So that's kind of how we're working to the direction that we're moving through combo towards.
00:59:29.920 - 00:59:43.060, Speaker A: All right. All right. So these questions, I think I'll just pick, like, four or five. So. Well, let's keep going. The next question is this. I'll just pick them, like, the most important ones.
00:59:43.060 - 00:59:56.390, Speaker A: Okay. And this question is, what are the future plans and development in the pipeline for furry combo? Any upcoming features or partnership we can look forward to?
00:59:59.210 - 01:00:48.282, Speaker B: Yeah, another great question, and, yeah, we're always looking to increase the robustness. For example, we are working with a protocol called radiant, which can offer us 0% flash loans. So right now on Aave, every user, whether they're coding their own contract going through us, they're going to be charged 0.09%. So that kind of reduces the efficiency and reduces the possibility to find some arbitrage. So we're working with a protocol called radiant, who might be able to offer us 0% flash loan fees. And the unique thing here is it's also built on Ave, so we don't have to kind of incur any audit cost, although we go through the contracts to make sure there aren't any major changes. We might have to do a minor audit, but it kind of saves us on the audit cost there as well.
01:00:48.282 - 01:01:29.640, Speaker B: So that's one thing we're working on, is, is bringing more efficiency to Fru combo through maybe different protocols or changes in tooling, such as a reduction in flash loan fee. So, of course, the other thing that we were working on, which I spoke about, which is the composable router, that's going to open the doors for much more builders to get involved. We're looking at expanding functionality for things that aren't yet available. Maybe that's through options or leverage platforms like GMX or gainshead. So now you can come to fruit combo. You can do some leverage trading through our interface, which is impossible currently. And then we're looking at some cross chain stuff like, how can I.
01:01:29.640 - 01:02:28.664, Speaker B: Maybe I can deposit on Aave on arbitrum, and I can borrow funds on optimism, something like that. So that's going to allow more cross chain functionality. We're looking at that through some partners like Dabridge. Layer zero AV eight also directly has something called portals, so that may expand some functionality as well. Maybe. How can I do a swap on one transaction, send it across to another network, and maybe deposit that into liquidity pool all in one transaction? So right now it's not possible because you need to wait for some confirmations on a network before you can execute a transaction on another one. Like Polygon has had a lot of reorganizations with their blocks lately, so typically you got to wait 300 confirmations before you can receive your deposit on the other side.
01:02:28.664 - 01:02:49.890, Speaker B: That simply doesn't allow us to do those chain transactions cross chain. So we need to look into others that might be able to help us achieve this and streamline the process for users. So really we're just looking at making things easier, increasing efficiency, and kind of adding more and more core functionality as we go.
01:02:52.550 - 01:03:47.570, Speaker A: All right, awesome, awesome, awesome. Those amazing answers of yours, they are very good and great. I believe if this person is on this pace, he or she is going to be satisfied with the answer you've given so far. All right, so let's just do two more before we go. I just feel we should actually answer this question because I feel the person who wrote this question might actually, like, been affected by flashlung attack issues and the rest of them because I feel this question is more personal and I did not even expect it or I did not see it coming. And the question is this, what measure does furry combo have in place to prevent and mitigate potential risk such as flash loan attack or smart contract vulnerability?
01:03:51.390 - 01:04:46.000, Speaker B: Yeah, so the smart contract one is interesting. I don't think I can recall a transaction that's gone through for a combo that's acted in a negative manner, for example, to hack someone or to exploit or sandwich to hack some funds. I think most of those malicious actors have created their own contracts and bots to kind of take advantage of this. The thing about fruit combo flash loans, for instance, is you can only interact with the platforms that are on fruit combo. So a lot of these flash loan attacks are targeting smaller projects or contracts directly. So that simply just isn't possible with froo combo. So like I said, I haven't seen any attacks that I can recall that have gone through fruit combo because you're interacting kind of with these blue chip contracts, you're interacting directly with the Uniswap contract.
01:04:46.000 - 01:05:20.590, Speaker B: So, and then on the security side, yeah, I mean, there's, there's a lot of complexity to adding these, these contracts into a proxy. And we've had to, over the years, go through many, many audits. I think twelve or 13 there. So I think as time goes on, as you've completed more audits, the risk goes down. There is always the risk there. But again, security is of paramount importance to us. So we try to ensure that we're doing as much as possible to make sure users are safe.
01:05:20.590 - 01:06:25.852, Speaker B: For example, one thing that we changed recently, that a lot of protocols have changed that greatly reduces the risk, is when you're approving funds to use in the contract, you only approve the amount that you need for that transaction. So say I'm swapping 10,000 USDC, I only approve 10,000 USDC. Previous to this, a couple years ago, a lot of these contracts would just approve unlimited. So say I had 300,000 USDC in my wallet, but I only swapped 10,000 if there was an exploit on that contract, you've now given a limited approval for that contract to use your USDC. So if that contract gets exploited now, that hacker can suck that 300,000 USDC out of your wallet. So a lot of protocols, including us, have changed that to just 10,000 USDC to perform that transaction. And the interesting thing is the 10,000 USDC, once you've done that transaction, that approval gets closed.
01:06:25.852 - 01:06:42.200, Speaker B: So you don't have to worry about that user withdrawing $10,000 from you 30 times and draining your wallet that way. So there's a lot of little things that you can do to ensure that the security is good and frugal combo is taking advantage and looking at all those different areas.
01:06:43.460 - 01:07:09.340, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome, awesome, great. All right, so let's do the last one before we go. And this question is this, I think this particular person is concerned with gas fee, and the question is, how does furicombo address concern around gas fee and scalability in the defi space, especially during times of high network congestion?
01:07:12.530 - 01:07:50.726, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Another great question. I always recommend, depending on the funds, like Ethereum isn't going to be the best for you. A lot of times you get, like you mentioned, times of high gas fees where nfts are being dropped or new tokens are being dropped and gas fees spike really high. So, you know, switch to a network that isn't going to incur such fees. And a lot of these smaller networks are giving some incentives, like optimism will give you bonus optimism tokens. On depositing in Aave, stuff like that, arbitrum is done.
01:07:50.726 - 01:08:25.410, Speaker B: Airdrops, we're looking at all these smaller networks and adding them like we're looking at adding Zksync. Zksync hasn't done an airdrop yet. If you perform some transactions on Zksync, you may be eligible for the airdrop. This could be 2000, 5000, $10,000 to you. So there is a bonus to looking in and performing transactions in these smaller networks. Not only because you're saving on gas fees, you may get some bonuses from the network in terms of tokens or Airdrop. So that's one thing to look at.
01:08:25.410 - 01:08:47.799, Speaker B: I think it's easiest to just get involved on Ethereum, but start exploring the world a little bit. There's lots going on with these smaller networks. If you're dealing with smaller asset amounts, it's not really going to matter which network you go on. You're not going to have liquidity. Crunch. You can pretty much go anywhere. So yeah, definitely check that out.
01:08:47.799 - 01:09:34.202, Speaker B: If you are going to perform on a transaction on Ethereum, you can adjust the gas fee. If, for example, you're depositing into a lending protocol, it doesn't matter when the transaction gets executed, it's still going to eventually execute. So set your gas a bit lower, sit on it a bit. If you're okay waiting 24 hours, 12 hours, 10 hours, you know, if the current gas fees 30 way set it to 15, at some point that transaction is going to get executed. You're going to spend half the gas fees and it's not going to matter if you need it immediately or if you're doing a swap where the price can change. You're not going to want to wait that long because the transaction is just going to revert. So that's another option.
01:09:34.202 - 01:10:23.528, Speaker B: See if, okay, I can wait a bit on this transaction, I'll lower the gas fee, I'll try to get it for cheaper. You can always go back there in your wallet, in your metamask and speed that transaction up later. So that's one option. If you're doing it on Ethereum, you can adjust the gas fee there. I'll pass it back to the host there if they're available.
01:10:23.584 - 01:10:39.120, Speaker A: Okay. Sorry, sorry, my mic was muted. I was actually talking to, to myself all this way. I said, um, awesome, awesome, great, great. And mad stuff. When we say mad stuff, it means amazing stuff. And, um, the speech was well delivered.
01:10:39.120 - 01:11:08.940, Speaker A: So this actually a dream come true, right? Seeing you one of those projects you believe in, um, coming to your ame to deliver a speech. Right. And, um, having been one of those early adapters who saw, who saw, um, fury combo at the spike of, um, flash loan. Right. And trying to use the platform to do amazing stuff and all of that. So it's cool. So you following up something for a very long period of time.
01:11:08.940 - 01:11:33.834, Speaker A: You following up something for a very long period of time and you're bringing them up. Yeah, it's more like a dream come true for me because I know it's not easy, right. Trying to reach out to the project like fury combo and bringing them on this platform to come talk to us. Haven't followed them for a while, not even a year, not even a tour. I think. Well, I think close to three years now, so I'm following up.
01:11:33.882 - 01:11:34.186, Speaker B: So.
01:11:34.258 - 01:12:14.040, Speaker A: And today it seems like that particular dream came into reality. So kudos to fury combo team for honoring this invitation. I'm grateful and I'm really, really happy. And for everyone who has actually attended this ama, I want to say a very big thank you as well for the. From the Afrik family. And you've done amazingly well staying up for like, um, one and a half hour listening to us talk, like navigating the combo interface and everything and getting to ask questions. So I believe you've learned a whole lot or even one or two stuff that will help you in your defi journey.
01:12:14.040 - 01:13:07.008, Speaker A: So as you keep interacting with furry combo, you keep noticing and you keep improving and you keep getting what you want in the defi space. But don't forget, Blazer said something very, very important and very amazing, that if you stumble upon anything, you can always reach out to the community on discord. And I said something as well, that in everything you do, community building and support should actually be one thing. It should be top notch. And the Kombo family have taken it upon themselves to provide us. So if you stumble upon anything that is not clear to you, you can quickly run to discord and someone will be there to attend to your needs and the person will be there will gladly pull you through. So that's amazing, and we really appreciate you guys for coming.
01:13:07.008 - 01:13:16.740, Speaker A: All right, so, Blasa, before we. Before we wrap up this space, before we end this space, do you have any word to say before we wrap it up or before we call it a day?
01:13:18.610 - 01:14:19.328, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I absolutely appreciate you guys reaching out to us and having me on this talk. This is fantastic. You guys had some awesome questions. Super glad to just share information and share with different communities. So I'm really excited for looking to expand the Defi ecosystem and just help to bring this product and the whole space to different communities where we might be able to help and foster positive growth because there's a lot of areas that are, for example, have issues with the current ecosystem, with the way banking is now. And this just helps to kind of bank the unbanked and the whole space is just awesome. So super excited that you guys hosted us on here and that we were able to share a bit with, with your community and, you know, I hope that's useful for your community.
01:14:19.328 - 01:15:11.120, Speaker B: If you haven't checked out Faroo combo, definitely check us out. Feel free to follow us on twitter. Follow myself and yeah, as was mentioned, we are always, always excited to help anyone else out on the discord, on the telegram. Don't feel like you have a stupid question, just reach out to us. I'm always available in the discord to help and my prerogative is to put the community, put the user first. So as the community manager, you know, that's the, the most important thing to me to ensure your, your satisfaction. So I want you to have a good experience on fruit combo or, you know, just reach out to us about any decentralized finance or anything, crypto or blockchain, you know, I'm super excited about the space, so is everyone in the project.
01:15:11.120 - 01:15:26.656, Speaker B: So we're always just excited to talk and have fun and, you know, learn things, new things with you. So we'd be very happy to have you as part of the community as well. And I can't thank you guys enough for being here and hosting us on this.
01:15:26.848 - 01:15:40.120, Speaker A: All right, cool. Cool. Sir, thanks to everyone who has actually sticked with us for these one and a half hour. We love you and we appreciate you. It's not easy. Yeah. Without you, chain Africa is nothing.
01:15:40.120 - 01:16:22.174, Speaker A: And without you, fury combo will move forward. So we just get to keep supporting both communities and let's see what we can build together. Let's see what we can actually achieve together in the defi ecosystem. And we definitely know these are trying times in crypto, but we don't just get to stop, we get to keep pushing and we get to keep making impact. When I mean impact, I mean positive impact, right? That will lead to positive growth. So we keep doing that and we keep sticking together. So let's stick together and let's keep moving forward as well together and let's keep supporting each other and let's keep growing.
01:16:22.174 - 01:16:45.300, Speaker A: So at this point, this is what we're going to call this space to an end. See you, um, guys some other time. And we really appreciate. Good night and, um, have a wonderful night race. And for those of us who going to watch on Champions League final, be careful and also enjoy the rest of the weekend. See you guys next week, and God bless. Good night.
01:16:47.400 - 01:16:49.080, Speaker B: Thanks again. See you. All right.
