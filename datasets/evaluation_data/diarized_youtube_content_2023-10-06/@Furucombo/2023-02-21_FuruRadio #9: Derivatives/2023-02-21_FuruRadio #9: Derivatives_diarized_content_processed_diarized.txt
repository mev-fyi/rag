00:00:02.520 - 00:00:41.680, Speaker A: All right, I don't want to keep any or everyone too long here, so maybe we can get into just some quick introductions. So thanks, everyone who's here today for this episode of Fru radio around derivatives. So we're joined by yen Wen from perpetual protocol. Sarah, maybe here from GMX, I believe that's her. Or they. And we're waiting for one more from Opyn. But Yan Wen, maybe you want to just provide a brief introduction, a little bit about yourself, how maybe you got into crypto, and a little bit about perpetual protocol.
00:00:43.860 - 00:01:28.664, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Yeah. So, yeah, thanks for the invite, and, yeah, it's great to be here. I'm one of the co founders of Perpetual Polo. We start from 2020. We are kind of like one of the first unchained derivative exchange that working on perpetual swap, which is kind of like a specialized, kind of like a little bit like future contract kind of a derivative we built on top of AEM. So we have our own design of the AEM on V one, and then we on v two, we actually build on top of units or v three.
00:01:28.664 - 00:01:55.604, Speaker B: So kind of like a gathering the concentrate equity on units of v three so that it's more capital efficient. Yep. So since then, I think we got, like, around maybe, like 60 billion trading bargain, like, combined, like v one and v two. Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, if you want to check it out, I mean, the website is like perp.com. perp.com. Yep.
00:01:55.604 - 00:01:59.200, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think that's it. Yeah. Thanks for invite.
00:01:59.500 - 00:02:04.360, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much. Seraph, are you there?
00:02:04.980 - 00:02:30.690, Speaker C: Yes. Hi, I'm from GMX. So I got into blockchain a few years ago, and I was involved in GMX at the early beginnings from gambit days at BSC. And we lasted until BSc. There were some issues, and then we migrated to Abitron. And as you know now, GMX is pretty stable, and we are working towards the version two GMX syntactics. Yeah, that's about it.
00:02:33.510 - 00:02:34.278, Speaker B: Cool, cool.
00:02:34.334 - 00:03:17.980, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks for being here, Seraph, and I'd love to hear more about GMX V two later on. But, yeah, it looks like we won't have anyone here from Opyn, but that's okay. If they join later on, we can kind of continue on. So thank you both for the introduction. I just want to maybe go into, just for the basics of people that may not understand what are derivatives and kind of why are they important? Why are protocols looking to develop these things? And how can it be useful to an everyday user? Whoever wants to just jump in, we can just talk about this, these topics as we go through them and see what we come up with.
00:03:23.280 - 00:04:22.880, Speaker B: Yeah, let me go first. So for derivative, I actually don't know the exact definition of that, but I think most of other, I mean, like the financial instrument, other than the spot market are considered derivative. The traditional financial system are mostly built on top. I mean like built out of derivative. I mean, I think the biggest market of traditional finance is option and futures actually are kind of like two of the biggest market. And also, of course, like you have like other interest rates offer everything, but most of the, most of the trading modeling is actually on the royalty side. The reason of that is that financial system is really complex and then they are like so many different needs.
00:04:22.880 - 00:05:08.098, Speaker B: So, I mean, on the spot market, you can buy the spot. That's really good. But sometimes you need customized financial instrument to fit your needs. And then that's actually where the security comes in. For example, the reason why you want to trade perpetual swap is that because you want to get leverage, you want to be more capital efficient. If you only trade on spot market, you cannot do that. So I think that's the main reason that people just want like kind of like going to a little bit niche.
00:05:08.098 - 00:05:14.150, Speaker B: Like want to get that special kind of like financial instrument that fit your use case.
00:05:14.810 - 00:05:15.378, Speaker C: Yep.
00:05:15.474 - 00:05:23.130, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's how I think about the derivative. Cool.
00:05:23.170 - 00:05:33.940, Speaker A: No, I think that's a great explanation. And then with perpetual protocol, is there, or what's like the maximum leverage that you can do? And I, obviously you offer both long and short positions or.
00:05:35.400 - 00:05:56.648, Speaker B: Yes. So the max is like ten x. So we only do like ten x on chain. We actually want to increase that, but the community actually pushed back on that. So we want to launch a vote, but most of people say no, we want to increase that to 25 or 20 x. Yeah, but it's just a given story. We can do more.
00:05:56.648 - 00:06:09.730, Speaker B: But I think for retails, ten x 20 x is probably the max that they, or it's not too risky for the retails.
00:06:13.630 - 00:06:30.250, Speaker A: Cool, thanks, Yanwen. And then how about GMX? How does GMX fit into this? And what are your thoughts, Serif, on? Why are derivatives so important? And why is it important to develop platforms that can support these kind of trading actions?
00:06:30.330 - 00:07:11.710, Speaker C: Yeah, like he mentioned, there's actually, the current setup for traditional finance is a little bit, a lot more complex. And okay, there are reasons for it, I guess, for regulation, to protect the retailer and things like that, but there's also a lot of unnecessary complications. And you see that in you know, institutes are not. We have this thinking, the government has this thinking that regulation is to protect the retail, but who is going to protect the retail from bad actors like, you know, what happened in FTX. And I am one of those guys who actually believe in FTX. I believe in SPF. So when the fuck started, I didn't take out my money.
00:07:11.710 - 00:07:56.918, Speaker C: I thought, ah, don't worry, it's just like USDT and things like that. The things would go away. And in the end, no matter how good a trader you are, you want money or you hedge your position, you hedge your spot coin, you hedge it on FTX, it's all gone. So this is, this is for us, for GMX, is that we believe that it'll be for derivatives, for Defi, and it will be better off if it's on chain that no one can control your wallet. Yeah, because FTX really taught us a very big lesson. Even, I mean, for people like me, who really don't believe in any other exchange except FTX, it was a shock. And then now, you know, we have OKX, we have binance and things like that.
00:07:56.918 - 00:08:26.288, Speaker C: Probably they have a lot of proof of fund, proof of reserve. But end of day, we still think that it's better to trade your derivatives. For now it's only for us. We are using GLP. And then the next one will be coming soon, in March, GM's synthetics, all this will be on the chain. So people can know that where their profits are coming from. They are confident that if you trade, if you hedge your position of your coin and stuff like that, you are able to take profit into your own wallet.
00:08:26.288 - 00:08:32.860, Speaker C: You control your own wallet. So I think this is very useful. This is very useful and very important for blockchain.
00:08:37.240 - 00:08:59.704, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's a good point. Yeah. It's an unfortunate event when the thing with FTX happened. But I'm wondering, did that push more people to, to do the derivatives on chain? Have you seen an increase in volume since that kind of took place? Or did that kind of push maybe more people out of the market and then it's going to take time to bring them back?
00:08:59.792 - 00:09:44.774, Speaker C: Yes, a lot of immediately after the fts increased, the next two, three weeks the volume increased by a lot. And actually the ironic thing is that the volume is limited by what we call what the capacity of the GLP. GLP is the counterparty of counterbalance pool of whatever the traders are trading. So if GLP doesn't increase in size, we cannot take in more traders. And now a few like a few real traders, they can take up almost all the capacity of GRP already. So our limitation is actually not that we have difficulties attracting traders. There are a lot of traders coming in, especially with FTX.
00:09:44.774 - 00:10:19.190, Speaker C: And then last week there was not. Last week, just a few days ago, BUSd was having some issues. I still believe in binance, but I hope Binance will survive this. But for us, we are actually limited by the GLP and we are growing the pool with more and more people interested in stable growing. So it's not about the trader. The trader actually is a huge amount coming in. And from next month, if the Gmail synthetics come out, hopefully both traders and capacity of the pool will increase by a lot.
00:10:19.190 - 00:10:24.030, Speaker C: So we have more interest than what we are capable of serving.
00:10:26.930 - 00:10:28.950, Speaker A: Right, right. Yeah. That's interesting.
00:10:30.850 - 00:10:31.202, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:31.226 - 00:10:46.920, Speaker A: I'm not sure how long is it the GLP pool has been out, but I came across that recently and found that was quite interesting and some decent yield there as well for people who are willing to pool their funds there to help with the trading actions.
00:10:56.300 - 00:10:56.788, Speaker C: Cool.
00:10:56.844 - 00:11:44.550, Speaker A: So let's jump to the next question then. Yeah. So what's, I guess the current state of the derivatives market in Defi? Do you guys think we're pretty early on, there's a lot of development still to happen or like what's the, do you think we need to attract more kind of retail or institutional or what kind of needs to happen to take derivatives? I guess to the next step, because as you guys have both mentioned, derivatives is a fairly large market, well the largest market in traditional finance. So do we see kind of that growth happening in Defi or, you know, what kind of steps do we need to take to get it there or it's just not going to happen? What are your thoughts on that?
00:11:49.930 - 00:12:42.668, Speaker B: Yeah, let me take it first. I think current status, even though I mean like the FKX goes down, lots of people, I mean don't trust central exchange anymore, but the gax market is still like single digit percentage of the central change market size. So we still have a long way to go. I think usability wise, the Dax skill behind you need to go on chain. Like GMX is on Albitron, we are on Hopkinson. I mean like some people, they found some polygon, they have to move their files. There are lots of details that they need to take care of which bridge lots of different things.
00:12:42.668 - 00:13:17.970, Speaker B: You need to have the ETH token or have the matic token first in order to use a protocol. So it's just lots of small, little detail that make the onboarding really hard. There are lots of team working on that will get fixed, like, in a year or two. But right now, I think the market is still really big. I mean, like, for DAX, not only derivative, but also for the spot market. Yeah. So I think that's the current skaters.
00:13:17.970 - 00:14:23.348, Speaker B: And for the retail, of course, like, you know, we build a product for the retail, for the institutional traders, like, for both of them. But if you look at the traditional financial market, most of the derivatives are traded by the institutional traders. They have the needs, they trade based on their portfolio, based on their target. I would say that we probably need more institutional traders, like trade down Dax more. Most of the institutional traders I know that we talk to, they don't trade. I mean, Dax, there are lots of different issues. You know, like, some of them, they have regulations they need to trade against, like, known parties, and then it's not happening on chain or other people.
00:14:23.348 - 00:14:53.124, Speaker B: They, um, the gacs, there are lots of different kinds of risk. They are, it's hard for them to kind of measure the risk. So, um, you know, they are just like, like, details that we need to work. I mean, like, try to get a better solution on that. But I think in general, things will get solved and, I mean, like, there will be more institutional traders on, on trend trading derivatives and. Yeah, that's my point.
00:14:53.292 - 00:15:42.640, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree with Yan Wen. Also, for a lot of the centralized exchange, I mean, you have to understand that for crypto blockchain, the learning curve for public is very steep. For me, myself, it took me a while to learn how to use metamask to understand gas, to understand transactions are not necessarily immediate, and there's all these issues. Dex is going to be a little bit steep learning curve for quite a lot of people. So we still need good centralized exchange, like OKX, like finance, ok things, all these exchange to help people get in. Then it's like, it's like, how do I say, a ram? Once they know how to use centralized, they will slowly learn. It's like bitcoin is the mother.
00:15:42.640 - 00:15:53.590, Speaker C: When you know about the mother coin, bitcoin, you start to be curious about ethereum, you start be curious about other alternate coin, and then you, you join hotel California. You can't leave.
00:15:59.490 - 00:16:56.840, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah, no, I mean, it's an interesting point, too. Like, with the regulations that, you know, especially with this Paxos thing in finance, it seems like a lot of the, with the regulations, it seems to push people into defi once they can kind of overcome the barrier of entry with different chains and bridging and all that. But I think we're slowly starting to see that shift there. So it'll be, I mean, it's going to be interesting to me to see where things get in one year, two years, three years, but I think we're heading in the right direction anyways. So I guess that kind of, we talked a little bit about the ongoing issues with adoption, but is there anything else maybe you guys want to mention? And that's kind of the next question. Anything else besides maybe user experience or regulations that is a potential problem for the derivatives market?
00:16:57.620 - 00:18:00.100, Speaker C: Yeah, for user experience, I agree with that because the user experience for crypto, for chain blockchain, specifically for GMX, we have actually faced a lot of user feedback and then we try to adjust it. They love it when our user UiuX is closer to FTX or binance. Even though institutes or big traders or small traders doesn't matter, they usually prefer when the interface is closer to FTX or binance, they actually give us these type of feedbacks and then whenever we adjust, it may not be better, you know? You know what I mean? But people like familiar, just like our keyboard, it's not the better one, but people are familiar with it, so they like it. So I guess this is something that we learn. We want to, when people ram into sex, we want them to go into using chain, we want them to give them not too much new things to learn, just make it very familiar to them. That's good. Hope that helps.
00:18:04.280 - 00:19:15.180, Speaker B: Also, like, one thing I want to add, like the, you know, like people might not be happy. I mean, I mean, I heard about this, but I do think that if we want to bring more institutional traders, there must be some kind of like KYC or like regulated environment for the institutional traders. Otherwise we can only onboard maybe some traders, they are very familiar with crypto everything. But that's actually a tiny portion of the overall financial traders. Like, or I mean, like institutional traders. So, you know, like, I hate this, but that's if we want to really grow like a derivative market to 100 lakhs. I do think that in my, you know, there must be some kind of trade off between the regulation and also the financial freedom.
00:19:18.410 - 00:20:00.914, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting point, Yan wen, and I do agree with you on that. One thing I will say is I don't know if it has to be mutually exclusive or if we can just have both a regulated derivatives market and an unregulated derivatives market for just everyday trading. Because I know one thing we were looking at when we developed a fund system or for fruit combos. One question we got asked a lot was, is there going to be private funds where, you know, you can create a mutual fund that's closed for certain investors of, you know, an institution. So, you know, you're a bank and you want to create a private fund that only the bank clients can invest into. Right. So similar idea here.
00:20:00.914 - 00:20:30.490, Speaker A: You know, maybe there can be private derivative funds that, you know, require certain access. You have to be a bank member or regulator, own a special NFT or whatever the case is, and then you can get access to that pool. But I think you're on the right track. I totally think that's where things are going to get. But again, I don't know if, you know, we have to just have one or the other. I think we're going to have a situation where there's going to be many different markets, derivatives markets and everything.
00:20:32.390 - 00:21:06.880, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I agree. I think that's the best cases. I mean, like, so, like people can be, if they want to go into the market, KYC right now that take your own risk or you want to go into a KYC market or a KYC network so that everyone is KYC and then the institutional traders are more comfortable with that. So if we can be given that choice, I think that would be much better then just like go either one.
00:21:09.300 - 00:21:26.160, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. Agreed, for sure. Awesome. Thanks for that information about the ongoing issues, then. I think those are all valid. Definitely. Hopefully we can overcome those and continue growing the derivatives market.
00:21:26.160 - 00:21:48.860, Speaker A: So then in terms of largest future users, you guys think small traders or institution or maybe some others companies or dows or. What are your thoughts on who's going to kind of take the largest slice of pie when it comes to the volume or trading action with derivatives?
00:21:59.880 - 00:22:54.020, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. So like I said, I think the institutional traders are the, the driver of the derivative, like maki trading volume or the market size. But I mean, like the trader here, I mean, there are different kinds of trader traders has given goals and needs, but in order for that to happen, we need the traders. I mean, institutional traders, but they have different goals. You know, some, some people want to hedge the risk of like, of their spot holding or some other people want to do arbitrage. We just need like more different people with like different goals given angle, enter the market so that we can have a really active market.
00:22:54.020 - 00:22:56.460, Speaker B: Yep, that's.
00:22:59.240 - 00:23:37.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Institution have their different reasons, different ways they can be losing money on trading here. But it is okay because it's part of their hedging or, you know, their ways of protecting themselves against the market, stuff like that. So institutions are very different from retail. Retail are just out there to speculate, to make some money. Of course, there are retailers who also hedge, who also want to protect their bigger spot, their bags of coins, stuff like that. But mostly it's institutions who have a very large, very different agenda compared to the retail.
00:23:37.614 - 00:23:40.650, Speaker C: Yeah, it's very correct in this.
00:23:44.070 - 00:24:24.490, Speaker A: Cool. And do you guys think like, we have the correct tooling for these institutions? Like are they interested in opening long or short positions on assets that are available in the market right now or do we need to look at offering something that's maybe more traditional, like focusing on market index puts or calls or certain stocks or certain currencies or. What do you guys think on the global scale of things? Do you think they're going to be interested in coming into the market and dealing with what's available now?
00:24:30.080 - 00:25:08.712, Speaker B: Yes, I think we need more offers. I mean, so right now we are doing perpetual swap. GMX is the same, we are in the same market. But most of the institutional traders they are looking for, like I said, they have a use case for them. Some of them, they want to, hey, just a different use case. So they might need different tools for their use case. Right now for the Gacax, I think the perpetual swap is, I mean, among all the derivative is the biggest market.
00:25:08.712 - 00:25:48.420, Speaker B: But actually options, a lot of traders need options to hedge different kinds of risk. So option market is not big enough on Gacs. So that's something that I think a lot of traders are looking for. So, yeah, so I agree that we don't have enough offer yet. There are no people, I mean, there are some people doing entry rate swap, all these really advanced derivative, but there is no adoption because of different reasons. I think the market needs some time to evolve. So I'm not really worried about this.
00:25:48.420 - 00:25:53.720, Speaker B: But yeah, definitely we need more different kinds of financial instrument to fit the needs of.
00:25:56.730 - 00:26:37.010, Speaker C: Yeah, options is definitely one of the biggest thing to come up about. And also I think Forex, forex is a huge market without blockchain. Forex on its own has been very developed and forex is huge, huge, very, very huge. But the problem with blockchain, other project doing forex is that they are very worried about regulation. And I guess there's reason to be, to be wary about because forex is sensitive. So I think forex is a good, we hope to have more players on Forex, on options coming in and then the regulators will have adapt. Regulators are usually playing catch up.
00:26:37.010 - 00:26:42.310, Speaker C: So we hope that we move, evolve better in a responsible way also. Yeah.
00:26:44.890 - 00:27:44.190, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And I mean, that was one of the things I was a little excited about with Luna was the fact that, you know, the rewards were provided in different kind of currency tokens, which could have been, you know, very useful for forex. I can't remember how many different currencies you got, but it was like 30 and, well, I mean, I guess that didn't pan out, but it was an interesting concept anyways, and something we're definitely going to need into the future. So we'll see kind of how that develops. But, yeah, I mean, is there. We'll jump to the next question, which is the last question. And is there any new developments that are going to be game changers for the market? Feel free to talk a little bit about, you know, what your protocol is developing new version, kind of what the future looks like for the next year, and maybe some new developments in the market that you think are coming that could be interesting or useful or kind of perpetuate growth for the whole industry.
00:27:46.250 - 00:28:09.424, Speaker C: We are building Gmail synthetics. I think it's an open secret. We have been building that since last year. The developer for Gmail itself, the developers are a lot of, how do I say. They like to test things and make sure it's very, very good before they launch. And we have 5 million on immune, five for peak for white hats. White hats to know any bugs report to us.
00:28:09.424 - 00:29:00.150, Speaker C: We pay boundary out to 5 million. So the GMA synthetic has been a little bit slow, but we are launching soon for Synthetix is just now I mentioned that we have a lot of traders, but we're not enough counterbalance. GLP, or rather GLP is growing, but not growing as fast as the number of traders. So GM's syntactics should be able to solve that because once syntactic is out, every single crypto, any crypto asset that have interest for both short and longs, will have funding rates to attract the counterbalance. And this will also help us to increase the choices from bitcoin, ethereum to all other alternate coins, as well as to other non cradle assets such as for example, forex, things like that. We don't know what will come, but we plan the infrastructure for it and let it evolve.
00:29:07.890 - 00:29:09.070, Speaker A: Go ahead, Yanman.
00:29:11.010 - 00:29:36.950, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So for perpetual protocol, we actually have like a really good platform. So like I said before, we build on top of miniswap. So it's provide concentrated liquidity, it's a little bit like overboard. It's kind of like a mix between AAM and ogrebook. So you actually, I mean, LP can apply a lot of different strategy they want to do. So I think that's really cool.
00:29:36.950 - 00:30:43.186, Speaker B: We have this problem that it's going to be hard to LP on uniswap V three or this Syk style of GP provision. So we are actually trying to build different solutions, trying to get rid of that. And also one thing we learned from GMX is the toxic ogre foil that we should actually reduce it. So we are also working on other tools that help us reduce the cost for a little bit, not like 100%, but we want to decrease it maybe like 30% by 50% so that the LP can, I mean, I have more profit, I mean from providing liquidity. So that's one part, the second part is that it's not done by us. But there are many new research on the uniswap LP token. So you know it's Xyk.
00:30:43.186 - 00:31:41.590, Speaker B: So you have implement loss. People don't like implement loss because you kind of take a losing trades. But there are like lots of new research. They actually can turn like, you know, like some concepts are like what happens if you can kind of, I mean lend out your LP token and people to borrow it? Does it actually make a different kinds of payout? They are different. I mean like also like panactics, they have this new concept that once you rent out your LP token or like people borrow the LP token, you pay out actually become, I mean actually like the payout of an option. So that's actually really cool. So you know, we are seeing like many new people building new cool kind of a concept or projects on top of uniswap LP.
00:31:41.590 - 00:31:57.880, Speaker B: I think that's actually quite interesting. I do believe that that will be a new category, like kind of like a more like native defi financial instrument in the future. So I think that's really psyching.
00:32:02.860 - 00:32:16.480, Speaker A: Awesome. That sounds really cool. And then, so I guess what's the best place or person to follow to learn more about the derivatives market and then maybe learn more about GMx or perpetual protocol?
00:32:19.270 - 00:32:22.530, Speaker C: Sorry, sorry, you didn't get the last part. Sorry.
00:32:22.950 - 00:32:35.330, Speaker A: Yeah, no worries. Where can people follow or to learn more? Or is there like a docs for GMx or what is a good person to follow on Twitter for people to learn more about derivatives?
00:32:37.030 - 00:32:54.236, Speaker C: Oh, we can only recommend our own Twitter gmx. Actually kind of think of it. I don't even remember our twitter oh, give me a while.

Probably all the, every group have huge amount of scammers including on Twitter or telegram and discord as well. So the website is gmx IO. Gmx IO is a website and the twitter is gmx IO. So we share a lot of our partners as well.
00:33:32.434 - 00:34:08.436, Speaker C: So some of the partners, especially a lot of partners, they are using us to build their options trading or using us to build their GLP to, you know, fall and to land lending purposes and stuff like that.
