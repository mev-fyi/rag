00:00:08.280 - 00:02:01.646, Speaker A: Hey guys, welcome to the community call. So we are going to wait a couple minutes more waiting for Ave and one inch to join us. It. Hey Mark, that's wait for the one inch. They are. They should be coming before doing. We are waiting.
00:02:01.646 - 00:02:52.882, Speaker A: Let me give everyone a brief about today's agenda. So today's call will take about 30 minutes to give everyone the update about Furukanbo and also our partners like Aave and one inch for this call. And the first one will be. The first topic that we are talking about is the latest core features which is going to release on Furukanbo in next month. And the second topic we are going to talk about super aggregator in Defi. And in this section we invite Aave and also the one inch joined us to share their thoughts about what's the relationship between the money protocol and the aggregator. And the third topic will be what's new on Aave and we inch and then.
00:02:52.882 - 00:03:21.032, Speaker A: Yeah, Abe and Weinsh, they both have some pretty exciting news in recent weeks. So we invite them to share with everyone and also in a very. Everyone can use those new features through combo or you can use it on their website. And that part will be ask us anything. So any question, it will come. You can ask flu computer, you can ask Ave, you can ask one inch.
00:03:21.176 - 00:03:21.900, Speaker B: Yep.
00:03:22.600 - 00:03:53.690, Speaker A: Let's wait for two more minutes, then we will start. Yeah.
00:03:53.730 - 00:04:03.620, Speaker B: Mark's background is Richard, I'm sending you the background in DM on Twitter. Got you on Twitter. So you can have it as.
00:04:07.440 - 00:04:29.310, Speaker C: And also I can't stand the silence. So, um, am I gonna be able to kind of like make one of those personal loans, that whole credit delegation through, um. And I'm calling it for a combo. So correct me if I'm saying it wrong, but is that going to be an option or am I anticipating, am I going too ahead of myself?
00:04:29.890 - 00:04:59.230, Speaker B: So basically that's available as of today on the v two of the Aave protocol because we have native credit delegation, but we didn't build the UI for it yet, so you would have to use our documentation and basically create a credit delegation fold. So if that's technically possible to do it today, the answer is yes. Is it easy and accessible to everyone that doesn't know to code? The answer is not yet.
00:04:59.390 - 00:05:15.770, Speaker C: Got it? Got it. Okay. And I saw Uniswap did something called like Sibyl, were you able to see, you know, the delegations and who you're delegating? Is there a chance or is there kind of plans of Avi, you know, using that service also.
00:05:16.430 - 00:06:03.906, Speaker B: So basically, Sibo was built by Uniswap team directly, to the best of my knowledge. And I. It's directly linked to, because Uniswap used the voting system by compound. They have this kind of composability between compound and uniswap in terms of voting. So they can have everything inside the same platform. And that platform is civil. But Aave has his own way to do governance, and we have things that doesn't exist in the compound or Uniswap system, like the proposal power delegation, or the voting power, the delegation and all of that is degradated.
00:06:03.906 - 00:06:18.780, Speaker B: So we will have our own UI for delegation. And as we are in the community call, we can announce that it will be accessible to everyone very soon. And when I say very soon, it's a around today or tomorrow.
00:06:20.200 - 00:06:36.784, Speaker C: That sounds excellent. Yeah. So let. Let me continue asking to see if I get all my Christmas wishes. But let's. I don't want you to think I like. Yeah, let's make sure not to invite Richard to any community call because he's going to take the community call for him.
00:06:36.784 - 00:07:23.630, Speaker C: But let me get all my questions, if I can. This cooling down period while you're staking on Avi, I'm not a fan of it, you know, to the point where if I have x amount of Ave and I have to wait nine days, I don't know, is there any plans? You know, is that. Obviously, I'm okay with it now, but it's just like, you know, I'm a strong believer, especially when it pertains to crypto. Like, you know, you have always control of your funds, at least to the point where you're depositing and you withdrawn. Like, there should be no barrier, and it shouldn't be something that, again, extends to nine days, you know, dependent on any type of emergencies or anything that presents itself. So then what? What, you know, what answer do you have to that?
00:07:24.370 - 00:07:36.990, Speaker B: So. And let's let it be the last answer because there will be a time at the end of the event for question and answer for the project. And this is a fury combo called. So let's focus on fuel combo. So just to give.
00:07:40.630 - 00:07:41.850, Speaker C: Remember that question?
00:07:42.350 - 00:07:45.118, Speaker B: Yeah, let's answer that at the end of the.
00:07:45.174 - 00:07:57.806, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's cool. So I'm gonna unmute my. Thank you, guys. Thank you, everybody. I'm also gonna shut the camera. I'm not a model, so I don't like looking at my own face or anything like that. Forward to this.
00:07:57.806 - 00:08:13.950, Speaker C: Thank you very much, guys. Oh, and yeah, I do community advocacy for pull together. So if you guys are familiar together, have any questions or anything like that, end of synergies, you know, anything, you know, definitely here.
00:08:15.090 - 00:08:30.170, Speaker A: Yep. Thank you, Richard. And also thank you mark, for, you know, warming everything up. So let's start our community call. So as usual, everyone introduce yourself if you want. Okay. My name is shanting.
00:08:30.170 - 00:08:39.860, Speaker A: I'm the CEO of Furu Campo. I take care of the business development and also the product strategy. That's all. Next.
00:08:41.400 - 00:08:51.448, Speaker D: Okay, my turn. Hi everyone, my name is Jevon. I'm the full combo PM and the responsibility is the kind of feature and the sketch on the floor combo.
00:08:51.584 - 00:08:54.340, Speaker A: Yeah. Next.
00:08:56.040 - 00:09:05.220, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Blake, I'm the surfer in through combo. Really nice to meet you here. That's it.
00:09:08.240 - 00:09:15.672, Speaker A: Anyone else who want to introduce yourself? Mark, everyone knows you, but yeah.
00:09:15.776 - 00:09:37.720, Speaker B: So my name is Mark Ziller and as you can hear it, I'm French. I started in Ethereum in 2015 with the french community. Ethereum, France. And I'm super glad to have joined Aave in 2019 as the integration needs. And basically my job is to make third party developer life easier when they want to build cool things on top of Avi.
00:09:39.380 - 00:09:50.484, Speaker A: Cool. We see a couple of new faces here. Richard, do you want to introduce yourself? Even though I have known you before, but first time seeing you in a community call.
00:09:50.572 - 00:09:56.564, Speaker C: Welcome for sure. Yeah, it's like 06:00 so this is a morning Richard.
00:09:56.692 - 00:09:57.076, Speaker D: Wow.
00:09:57.148 - 00:09:59.440, Speaker A: We're doing based like East coast.
00:09:59.820 - 00:10:26.810, Speaker C: Um. No, I mean how can I tell you who is more like Richard? I'm a person, you know, I try to connect people one person with another. I try to play a role, you know, as much as I can and just help, you know, to onboard new user to explain things to people and just to continue to see the space grow, you know, for like all players, for everyone involved. That's it. That's me.
00:10:28.270 - 00:10:30.646, Speaker A: Well, welcome to the community call.
00:10:30.838 - 00:10:32.850, Speaker C: Thank you, thank you, I appreciate it.
00:10:34.870 - 00:11:26.534, Speaker A: And we have some new faces like Earl, Alvin, Spongy, TW. You guys want to introduce yourself? No? Okay, let us start our. The first section would be a second 2nd topic, latest cool updates on Furu combo. So here we are going to tell like share with you guys about like, you know, what will be you can expect from Furu combo in next month. And also what we have done in the past months because we hold our communico like once per month. So yeah, this is a great chance to let everyone know more about through combo Javan. Can you start with can we start with you? Start from you.
00:11:26.662 - 00:12:20.736, Speaker D: Okay, thanks Stanjing. And there are a few things we have been working on for quite well. And the first one, as you may have heard from our last communications, we have completed our dilemmas of the sensation synthetic minter and the compound borrow features. And these two big releases are currently under the audit and we will get the audit report in the next week. We will make users safe to use them as soon as possible. Okay, and the second one we are currently developing feature that the user can allow to set up their guest price and slippage. The guest price we know user can sell out in the metamask, but we hope user can sell out in the full combo before they click the send button and the slippage.
00:12:20.736 - 00:13:07.090, Speaker D: Currently default is 3% each queue. But in the future user can set up yourself and both of these belong to the transaction setting feature. Okay, and the next one we are also working on the feature that we allowed the user to set up the cubes input as the previous cube output. And it's not simply copy and paste. And this allows the cubes and cubes to be linked. It means the user don't need to add the token amount each cubes after they clean the refresh price. And we think this is a huge improvement to the user experience.
00:13:07.090 - 00:13:34.710, Speaker D: Okay, finally, we will distribute the unit token to the 57 users they ever use the full combo to interact with the uniswap and they will be able to claim the unitoken in the next week on the free combo interface. Okay, there are four coming up features and do you have any question?
00:13:37.610 - 00:13:39.870, Speaker A: Yeah, I think these features that we build.
00:13:40.490 - 00:13:46.990, Speaker B: Sorry, I'm thankful because I'm probably part of this address. So thank you for the uni.
00:13:47.730 - 00:13:52.242, Speaker D: Okay. It's a Christmas gift. Yeah.
00:13:52.426 - 00:13:54.230, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a Christmas gift.
00:13:54.740 - 00:13:55.640, Speaker D: Okay.
00:13:56.220 - 00:14:51.650, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the features that we built in q four, it sounds not so interesting or it's not something sounds super sexy, but it's a super useful feature that can really help our users to increase their successful rate of sending their transactions. No matter you are using a flash onto arbitrage or you want to manage your positions or any kinds of trading by these features, by these updates that will be helping you a lot. So we can wait to finish all the work and then ship it to our end users. Mobile Jeven, do you want to reply to Richard's question? Like using flow combo on mobile?
00:14:52.990 - 00:15:21.752, Speaker D: Can use the full combo on mobile it's okay because the full combo has the wallet connect. So you can use if you use like iPhone you can use in safari browser and to clean the wallet connect and it will to have a pop up and you can have like the trust wallet rainbow and other mobile wallets and you can come back to your software browser and you can use the.
00:15:21.776 - 00:15:39.900, Speaker A: Full combo and of course you can use metamask or like Coinbase wallet or other wallets that has a dev browser on your phone to visit fruit combo app. So yeah, we do design our dapp for the mobile version.
00:15:40.530 - 00:16:08.490, Speaker B: Yep. And so you don't specifically need to have an iPhone. So I have an Android and with Argent, oh you cannot see it but whatever. With argent you also have like the wallet collect integration. So I did some uniswap swaps thanks to Ferro combo directly with the Argent wallet. So the answer is can we use Fuhr combo mobile? Yes, and it's been a while.
00:16:10.150 - 00:16:11.610, Speaker A: Thanks Mark.
00:16:12.150 - 00:16:13.130, Speaker D: Thanks Mark.
00:16:14.510 - 00:16:21.890, Speaker A: So besides the update about the products, we have other updates. Can you share it with the community?
00:16:22.510 - 00:17:37.950, Speaker E: Okay, currently we have an ongoing campaign in our discord, so I'm going to brief you about some details about it. So I will cover what it is and how to participate the campaign and also how many people have joined the campaign. So the campaign name is called Combo hacking and it's running in our discord channel named Combo hacking and it's very easy to join and the purpose of this campaign is to create an environment for our members to share and discuss their strategy. Because everyone knows that through combo is very easy for users to create your own strategies, no matter you want to add liquidity to do motor swap or you want to use gas token to save the gas fees. So we know that there are many possibilities and combinations you can make through combo and we hope that our users can enjoy the discussions with each one and to share the ideas. So that's the reason we launched this combo hacking cat path and it's pretty easy to join. You just need to provide four information, and the first is to say hello to admin, because we need to know, like you are applying for this.
00:17:37.950 - 00:18:29.768, Speaker E: And the second is that you have to provide your transaction hash. And the third is that you have to describe the strategy behind the transaction. And the fourth and the last one is that you have to attach the screenshots of your combo. So once you provide all these four information in our combo hacking channel, everyone in the community can vote for you. So as long as you, you collect like ten upvotes, you can get a shot to win. A secret surprise is a grant, and currently it's still a secret and so currently only two people have already submitted and passed the combo hacking. And so they have already received the secret message to tell them what the grant is.
00:18:29.768 - 00:18:48.070, Speaker E: So if you want to know what that would be, you can just join this cadet. That's it. Welcome. And it's still an ongoing campaign and we didn't set. We haven't set a deadline for it, so we'll come for anyone to join. It's quite easy. The success rate is like 100%.
00:18:48.070 - 00:18:50.390, Speaker E: That's it.
00:18:51.970 - 00:19:30.518, Speaker A: Yeah. It's pretty cool to see people start to share their trading strategies in the discord and then discussing their strategies with others. Even like banana, he promotes his trading strategy, we call it combo hacking strategy on his twitter and also trying to persuade people to vote for him. I feel like we are really voting in a real life, but we are not voting for the government, for the president is voting for someone's, you know, trading strategy. I think this is pretty cool. Yeah. So everyone feel free to rejoin the combo hacking.
00:19:30.518 - 00:19:59.436, Speaker A: Any kinds of combo or any kinds of trading strategy is welcome. We don't, we don't like, set any limited to it. Yep. Cool. And we saw some questions. So during the community call we might, we might just move on first. So we, if we have time, we will ask the reply to questions in the AMA or someone from Fullcomp team will reply question in the chat.
00:19:59.436 - 00:20:29.936, Speaker A: Okay. And Zoe, please help to collect those questions that didn't respond. Okay, so let's move into the third part will be the super aggregator. So recently we wrote an article about talking about super aggregator. And if you haven't read it or you don't know what is a super aggregator field, definitely go to Fruitcambo's medium or blog to check it out. It's a masterpiece and you need to read it. It's the best one.
00:20:29.936 - 00:21:09.282, Speaker A: And the reason that we want to write an article talking about this is that we think aggregator will be the next huge thing. And also right now, I think most of the awareness and people's understanding about DeFi is all about money protocols. So we want to share our opinion about this. And also we see there are a lot of money protocol coming out every day. Like any kinds of money protocol. And currently, and also current protocols, they have more and more features like Aave Aave. They build their protocol starting from the lending protocol.
00:21:09.282 - 00:21:47.270, Speaker A: You can supply assets to it and or borrow assets from AAvE. But right now on Aave V two, there are more and more features. So they are like not just a money protocol. We feel like they are pivoting, not pivoting, but somehow changing to something like aggregator, and also one inch they start their product like aggregator. They help user to find the base rate across all the decentralized exchange. So they aggregate the decentralized exchange. But right now they have money swap, and also they have a lot of new features coming out.
00:21:47.270 - 00:22:16.240, Speaker A: So feel like they are moving to the money protocols. So it's very interesting to see money protocol moving to aggregator, and aggregator moving to money protocols. So we want to invite these two different partners to share their thoughts about how do you position on your product versus an aggregator? And we like starting from the mark.
00:22:17.540 - 00:23:44.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the whole point of DeFi is to give back ownership of their money to the users. And that's a pretty important statement, because we are so used in traditional finance that we just give our money to a third party and they do whatever they want with it. And the whole point of Defi is that you own your money, and if someone use your money, you should get your fair share. And that's the whole point of Defi. And a lending platform or a liquid market like Aave, you provide some liquidity, and if someone use it to borrow, well, you get some interest directly without commission, and you get the money directly inside your wallet. And if someone use that liquidity into a flash loan, you get your fair share, because every flash loan has a flash fee, and you will get your fair share as well. And basically, another very important point of Defi, and that's part of our vision, and it's a very common vision, is the ecosystem, is to say, we have decentralized platform, we have decentralized and permissionless code, we should not have centralized mindsets, and we should not think in silo saying, there's the Aave users, there's the commodore user, the Uniswap user, the one inch user, because at the end of the day, we have users that want true ownership of their assets and want to exploit their assets to the maximum possible benefits.
00:23:44.778 - 00:24:42.910, Speaker B: And the whole point of the strategy of AAve with the version two and everything we did so far this year was to build bridges and create synergy with other protocols. That's why, for example, in version two, with the new flashlan upgrade upgrade, you can do collateral swaps, you can do yield swaps. But in the background, what happened is that this liquidity dos swap doesn't happen directly on Aave, because we are not an exchange, we are not an amm. They are happening right now on Uniswap directly, and very soon, obviously, in order to be more efficient, they will use Dex aggregators, such as one inch, for example, or whoever is the most efficient in the market. And all of that is at the benefit of the end user. Because in defi, cooperation and synergy between protocols produce more value than just working in silos. And that's what we focus on.
00:24:45.130 - 00:24:54.790, Speaker A: Cool, thanks. And hey, we saw the wey inch. Sergey. Did I pronounce it right?
00:24:58.130 - 00:25:26.570, Speaker F: Hi everyone. Sorry for being late. I was quite busy. And thanks for. For being here. So I'm very happy to be here and answer questions. And thanks to ave that you mentioned us here, Mark, I don't agree that you are not exchange your exchange.
00:25:26.570 - 00:25:59.440, Speaker F: You open the doors when the liquidation positions ready to being liquidated. So we integrated Aave. This is about composability, what you said. Everyone is using everyone. And so we used Aave in a version one, and version two is right now in the development for swaps. A liquidation position is just a swap position, like limitor. You can just swap when the position is ready to be being liquidated.
00:26:01.700 - 00:26:50.826, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. And I think it's really interesting to see that all these fixed categories we used to have in DeFi are becoming more and more blur. And you don't know what is a liquidity protocol, what is a Dex aggregator, what is amm. And everybody works together in synergy in order to provide the best services. Because really, for me, you can use Aave solely and uniquely without never going to our website, only with using one inch. Like if you go to one inch and you have some eats, you can convert swap that directly to a die, for example, it's darker interest. And then you can swap your Adai directly in one inch for eat back and everything happen directly into one inch.
00:26:50.826 - 00:27:17.370, Speaker B: You never used the Aave website and the app. And you, you are a one inch user, obviously, but also have a user, and you can do all of that with aggregation and have this kind of path directly with Ferro combo as well. And I really love this thing where everything is distributed and it helps the fact that we want to be a decentralized ecosystem.
00:27:19.070 - 00:27:33.360, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree. And I think the compost composability is becoming a key features and making the defi even more a better place for aggregators. And it's really interesting to see they evolve.
00:27:35.660 - 00:28:35.302, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember last time when Uniswap, somehow I don't know why they are done, and then the website doesn't work very, very well. So they just post on Twitter says that, okay, right now you can access to uniswap using the ipfs or, you know, there are several way to access to Uniswap, not just their own official website of course, including the full convoy. And of course if you want to access to like one inch Aave, you have a lot of different source. You can, you can access to them. So I agree with Mark, it's really getting blurred. Like money protocol is not just, it's not just money protocol or aggregator, it's not just aggregator like everyone is in the DeFi and then sharing the same liquidity but trying to provide the best experience to the users. Cool.
00:28:35.302 - 00:29:11.250, Speaker A: So I think the aggregator and money protocols discussion will be very exciting and then we can still talk a lot about this. We should definitely open a new session having this kind of chat with more protocols including Aave and Y. But right now let's move on to our fourth topic, which is we want our partners like Ave and why introduce you guys to share what you guys shipped like recently. What about we start from one age?
00:29:11.950 - 00:29:47.834, Speaker F: Okay. Okay, thanks. So what we shipped in the last, I would say two, three months. So we released our v two version, two of one inch. So actually the first version was built on the news in the garage. I would say like yeah, actually we built it on a hackathon last year in New York. Over two sleep last night we were able to deliver first mvp and we improved that a little bit.
00:29:47.834 - 00:30:42.670, Speaker F: Also the design. So I built this design, you know, like I'm not, yeah, I have my experience, my professional experience, also parts of designs and so on, but I'm not very professional that. So I just introduced the dark theme and after that uniswap also introduced the dark theme and others starts to do that. And I just did it just because I needed it because like white screen is like terrible if you look the whole day, because I'm sitting the whole day on my Mac and working. So yeah, it was, the first version was like hackathon version and then the second version was more professional. So we grew from two and a half people, two and a half men to 30 people. We are right now 30 people and still adding more and more professionals.
00:30:42.670 - 00:31:20.238, Speaker F: And yeah, we have two designers right now, actually three who are working to improve the user experience because it's very important to work new people. You need to improve the user experience. It should be user friendly and fully understandable. So we were able to deliver the nice Uihe modular design kind of that where you, that you can just enable adisable components. Yeah, you can just have the user interface like Uniswap has. Or you can just also enable the chart, you can enable the table to compare to and also the route. Yeah.
00:31:20.238 - 00:32:03.390, Speaker F: So we introduced this special route view. It was only able for us to deliver it after we released the new version of the pathfinder. Pathfinder is kind of an algorithm which can discover all the different markets depths and find different paths by using different paths. Together with this pathfinder, we solved one more problem by reducing the failed transactions. So we have really small amount of failed transactions and empty transactions. We introduce partial fail. This is something new on the market.
00:32:03.390 - 00:32:50.470, Speaker F: No one except us implemented that yet from the aggregators. So for example, we have three different routes in one swap. And if one of these, or maybe two of these routes would fail, we just ignore them, revert the transaction back, the part of the transaction and the part which was successful, we just execute. That means you can maybe swap 30 percentages of your tokens with the maximum price impact which you set in the front end and you will be still happy, you know, like partial feel is great actually. You can just swap with zero percentage price leverage to ensure that you will not lost at front running attacks. Yeah. And front running thing.
00:32:50.470 - 00:33:26.200, Speaker F: Yeah, we released like three weeks ago, maybe two weeks front running protection. We are working with miners to ensure that the transaction is shared only with the miner. And miner keep it private. Not all of the miners support this feature, but like three of them. And we are working closely with the miners to ensure that you get a prior transaction. We call it private transactions, not really like private, but private kind of in the main pool. It's not shared in the main pool.
00:33:26.200 - 00:34:05.578, Speaker F: And it allows people, big traders, to swap also with one percentage, three percentage price leakage and don't really care about front running. Of course there are some difficulties if the miner minds uncle block would be shared, but we write about that. So everyone should understand that. So we are working right now on, on a new kind of governance. So I'm happy to announce that we are going to release soon, very soon. This kind of new kind of governance, we call it instant governance. We will disclose more really very soon.
00:34:05.578 - 00:34:24.680, Speaker F: So we are very busy. All 30 people work like kind of like 30 hours a day, seven days a week. And. Yeah, to be able to deliver that. And more news coming for sure.
00:34:26.780 - 00:34:34.960, Speaker A: I heard that you mentioned the governance. So does that mean one inch token is coming now?
00:34:36.580 - 00:35:21.676, Speaker F: So Howard said we are working very hard to deliver it. It's really a huge work. And this is our first iteration. More iteration would follow. And actually we release the instant governance together with our next version of liquidity protocol, our muni swap, we improved that. So we introduced new kind of fees which are right now not implemented anywhere in any other automated market maker. And this would allow to earn more liquidity protocol compared to all other protocols.
00:35:21.676 - 00:35:50.650, Speaker F: Also, the high volatility on the market when the market jumps and dumps, our pools earn much more than others. More and more protocols are coming. We plan limit orders protocol with tech profit and stop losses and some other protocols, but we can't announce it right now.
00:35:52.270 - 00:36:24.648, Speaker A: Well, I saw the one inch version too. I love it. Especially when user want to swap their token, they can really focus on the current market price. There's something like a trading view. And then you guys really simplify how user can input the amount and then get estimate amount out. And also the pathfinder, the bottom left side area there is show you how you guys find the best rate. It looks really, really cool.
00:36:24.648 - 00:36:46.590, Speaker A: And of course, the privacy transaction, which is my favorite function because I saw this brilliant, you know, by cooperating with like those nodes that doesn't forecast the transactions. I think this is a brilliant move. Can I ask, did you guys use the Tai Chi network or is, you know, the network besides Tai chi?
00:36:47.090 - 00:36:51.830, Speaker F: Tai chi is a part of that, but there are two more miners on board.
00:36:55.310 - 00:36:59.690, Speaker E: Curious how many users have tried the private transaction.
00:37:00.910 - 00:37:37.600, Speaker F: Actually not a lot, because most of the users are using metamask and metamask doesn't support signing transactions. So how that works, we have to sign the transaction and we have to send it over gateway, which is connected with all these miners. And actually, if you don't send through, if you don't send a prior transaction, we do broadcast as well. So we deliver miners new transactions. So that means our transaction is directly sent to the miners. And this is also kind of hidden feature here.
00:37:38.860 - 00:37:58.024, Speaker E: Yeah, because lately I'm thinking like, because we support one inch and many of our users use the one inch coupon through combo. So I'm wondering like maybe we can add a checkbox. Like if you check this, you can use the private transactions on one inch. So which means that we can also support that on brew combo. So I think.
00:37:58.072 - 00:38:31.630, Speaker F: So we can, we can offer that. So it's in planning. So we will extend our API and you would be able to do that. So actually, private transaction costs. Yeah, so this tai chi, taichi or something like this network is for free. But other miners, yeah. Get paid like an incentive and it costs and we pay from our money, so from our investor money, actually.
00:38:31.630 - 00:39:15.790, Speaker F: So, but that's great. You know, like this is innovation and it helps if it helps, and our user and your users are happy we can afford and pay for that. It's not huge money, but yeah, still something. Yeah. And we wish actually to work more with the miners, with all other miners who should actually implement this feature as well so we can have kind of better usability, I would say in Ethereum network, because it's annoying to see that you was front run by just a front run guy. And this is actually not cool.
00:39:17.450 - 00:39:32.830, Speaker A: You mentioned that the sending, the privacy transaction is more expensive. Expensive compared to the normal transaction. Can we know how expensive? What's the difference? Like average.
00:39:33.730 - 00:40:05.240, Speaker F: So we pay just for each transaction on top in dollars. I can't share the amount, but it's, yeah, it's like under NDA and it's in dollars and it's just for each transaction, it's like, you know, like, similar to like SMS, for example. So my previous company was intelligence like aggregator, and I offered sending sms, for each sms you pay something. It's similar, you pay for each call of this API.
00:40:06.180 - 00:40:24.080, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, we should definitely cooperate on this and also other features to bring user more better experience. That's a move on to the Aave v two, Mark. I think Aave also has a lot of very cool updates. Share it with us, please.
00:40:24.860 - 00:41:21.142, Speaker B: Yeah, I will try to keep it short because there's been quite a bunch of things in AVI and we have a limited time here. So let's focus on the big one that happened over the past ten days, because like ten days is like a lot of news already. So we released the AavE protocol V two that allows significant gas optimization. So one of the biggest issue of Defi right now is that if you are not rich enough, it doesn't matter, you cannot use it. And basically, if you have less than with like most protocol, less than $2,000 or $2,500, the amount of transaction fee you will pay to deposit and then withdraw into the protocol will equal one year of interest. So it completely killed the purpose. And the whole point of DeFi is to have like giving back ownership of the money to the users.
00:41:21.142 - 00:42:22.816, Speaker B: And no matter who they are, no matter how each they are or where they came from, it's completely permissionless finance and gas optimization helps a lot on that path. And also the architecture upgrades, general architecture upgrade will allow us to kick start the work to reach what we call the new frontiers. So outside of the Ethereum settlement layer, Ethereum layer one, in order to go into scalability solutions in the very short term future that will allow even more accessibility, no matter what the portfolio size, to have it and to decentralize finance services. So that's one of the big topics. We also have like brand new flashlunds. So Flashlund was made famous in 2020 for the good and the bad, a lot of good, a bit of bad, with all the acts that happen. And basically the new fledged loan are what we call batch flash loan.
00:42:22.816 - 00:42:59.482, Speaker B: So right now you can borrow a bunch of assets inside the same transaction. Previously was only one asset per transaction. So yeah, with 30 50 lines of code. You have 50 lines of code, a way to access $1.8 billion of liquidity and do whatever you want with it inside one transaction. Unprecedented in the history of finance, I think to have this power in the ends of so many people. And also the flash loan can interact directly with the AAVE protocol that was not possible on v one.
00:42:59.482 - 00:43:46.198, Speaker B: And that allows new functionality like collateral swap. Let's say you have it as collateral and you borrow and you see that, you think it is the future and it will grow over time. But in the very short term, you are afraid because of the bad news or whatever that the e price might go down for the short term. What you can do with collateral swaps is that you get, you keep your position completely open, you don't have to repay your loans. You do one flash loan, it's one transaction, and your e collateral will become, for example, USDC collateral, which is a stable coin. So your loan is protected, you have no risk of liquidation. And when the situation resolves back to the better trend for it, you can collateral swap back into it again.
00:43:46.198 - 00:44:28.454, Speaker B: And then nothing happened for your portfolio and you have been protected during that period of time. You can also do use that as yield swaps. So let's say you have Dai inside the protocol and right now it provides you 3%. You are happy with it, but for any reason there's a shorter of liquidity in USDT. For example, you can do a yield swap. So one transaction to exchange all your collateral in Dai into USDT in order to profit from the higher yield of USDT for the short period and then back. And obviously this is the kind of thing you can do with fuel combo right now.
00:44:28.454 - 00:45:05.492, Speaker B: And I can't wait that you can and implement the V two. So people and user of furocombo can use collateral swap and needleswap directly on Fiorocombo. And a bunch of other news, we got a bunch of exchange listings. So Kraken coinbase a lot, a few other ones as well. And also very important. The governance V two is life because the vote happened and it was implemented. So right now anybody that has enough Aave is able to say hey, I want my token added into the Aave markets.
00:45:05.492 - 00:45:40.090, Speaker B: And basically the UI is not implemented yet because the vote happened like two days ago. But as I said a bit earlier, it will be live depending on your time zone, either today or tomorrow. I think our asian friend will have to wait tomorrow morning for them, but the friends from west coast will probably see it today. And yeah, I think there's going to be more tokens and more assets and more markets into Aave in the very short term. And when I say in the very short term, I'm talking about the next few days.
00:45:42.750 - 00:46:37.298, Speaker A: Yeah, Aave two is like a huge update. Like everyone definitely tried it out on Aave's website and of course like full computing is working hard right now to update our smart contracts to support the Ave v two, including the batch, flash loan and other a lot of features. Like we even have a lighting talking about the new release of Aave v two. The two thing that I like the most is the guest optimization because people know that when we are interacting with the learning protocols, the guest fee will be a little bit higher compared to other decentralized exchange. I'm super glad to see Aave is the first one that to optimize the gas costs and that will help to bring so much better experience to every user. They can use a lower cost to enjoy more assets and then higher API. Yeah, I think this is pretty cool.
00:46:37.298 - 00:46:40.870, Speaker A: And also of course the blush. Okay, you go.
00:46:41.210 - 00:47:31.338, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's like a common responsibility as defy actors to do our best to have as lowest transaction fees for the end user. Because at the end of the day, as I said, is accessibility. We don't want financial system only for the rich. We want people that only have $50 or even $20 in some part of the world to be able to enjoy and access DeFi services. And everybody is doing their part inside the DeFi ecosystem. And for example, I have to shout out for one win to one inch because they were one of the first team to really access the problem with the creation of the Qi token that allow you to seamlessly, if you have some Qi tokens, to have some cash back into your transaction fee. And it was like super efficient.
00:47:31.338 - 00:47:39.830, Speaker B: It was a great improvement from the gas tokens that were existing before. And yeah, shout out to one inch team on that.
00:47:41.340 - 00:47:46.640, Speaker A: Yeah. Also we shout out to yh thanks for the Qi token function.
00:47:47.380 - 00:48:41.844, Speaker F: Yeah, yeah. Thanks for mentioning that. Actually, we just improved what two other guys built in the research. We met one of those guys in Osaka last year from gas tokenization IO GST two. And yeah, we asked him if it's okay for that guys, that we will create new version because they stopped the development of this project and we found a way to improve a little bit, so we were able to make it more efficient. So this address, contract address with a lot of zeros. I paid like $800 and had like, I run virtual machines in the cloud to mine this address.
00:48:41.844 - 00:49:13.950, Speaker F: It took like half of a week, maybe a week, I'm not completely sure. So to just get this, a lot of zeros to reduce the overhead and the gas token implementation. And yeah, we also try to keep the gas costs in eye. So we improved also with the v two, the gas costs very well. And we are going to release soon also in 2.1 version of one inch with less overhead for the aggregation.
00:49:16.250 - 00:49:18.070, Speaker A: Cool. That's pretty cool.
00:49:18.690 - 00:49:19.138, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:19.194 - 00:49:46.280, Speaker A: I think we have a couple of minutes left, so let's hop onto the last session will be ask me anything, like, ask everyone, ask the members everything. So we have a question from Richard, which is not. Haven't replied, so he's asking. Hey, Sergey, which wallet do you recommend it to use for privacy? Sergey, can you give us some suggestions?
00:49:48.180 - 00:50:10.474, Speaker F: Yeah, I personally use Ledgere. Ledger nano x treasure option. I have some here from Tracer as well. Yeah, yeah. But it's a little bit slow, you know, like if you sign a transaction on one inch. So to be able to sign prior transaction, you have to use Ledger. Yeah.
00:50:10.474 - 00:50:34.730, Speaker F: Not metamask. And it's like, yeah, it takes a little bit time to just send all the cold data which is analyzed here on the device. So from my point of view, there's right now no wallet on the market, which fulfill the needs of the DeFi users. From my point of view, let's just hint for you guys.
00:50:35.550 - 00:50:47.100, Speaker A: So, yeah, what about something like a mobile wallet is like later. It's like a wallethead. Is there any, like, example for mobile wallets?
00:50:48.320 - 00:51:14.904, Speaker F: So this trust wallet, there's arch. And so I have, I have all the wallets installed. So there's also pillar wallet, Alpha wallet, and there's another one. I forgot the name. There are several wallets. Yeah. So the people should take care about the security itself of the wallets when they install.
00:51:14.904 - 00:51:51.740, Speaker F: So how no action is quite well, but I didn't see any audience. I'm not sure if they really published the wallet audience itself. So we know we do blockchain stuff and we do audience of these smart contracts. But I didn't see from anyone that they published security audits of the wallet itself, of the software itself. So I come from like enterprise development. I was working consulting several startups. So and like also in the last, my previous job, Porsche, Porsche AG, the current.
00:51:52.880 - 00:51:53.536, Speaker A: So we.
00:51:53.608 - 00:52:25.020, Speaker F: I was responsible for security audits. So I organized security audits. I did like helping teams to improve the security and it's very important to do security audits also for like the front end for wallets and so on and so on. And I wish we will see next year more. And we also working with several companies to also audit what we built and we plan also to publish audits in this direction.
00:52:26.480 - 00:52:54.560, Speaker A: Thanks for the answer. And the next question we have still from Richard says, I have always seen fluorocample as IFTTT. I would like to be able to see Kubes made from other users like a leaderboard. Thanks. Yeah, so this is plan and this is also a feature that we keep building. We might have some news about this in 2021 Q one that can.
00:52:56.740 - 00:52:57.196, Speaker E: Give.
00:52:57.268 - 00:53:35.490, Speaker A: Our user or the developer in the community to build their own stuff and then connect it to full combo. Yeah, we are going to try pilot cases, several pilot cases in Q one. And then we have already started to talking to different protocols and projects. So definitely if you have any ideas what you want to build, what you want to integrate with through combo, feel free to reach out to us. You can reach out to us on Twitter or in discord. Yeah. Is there any question that people would ask?
00:53:36.750 - 00:53:42.890, Speaker C: I don't know, Mark, if that question that I asked you about the cold period is valid now. And I also have another question.
00:53:43.670 - 00:54:31.674, Speaker B: Okay, let's understood that. So basically, having a lockup period is something you need to have for a safety module, because the whole point of the safety module is to protect the protocol, like to be the guardians, as are the holders of the protocol, in case of what we call a shortfall event, which can be from a range to failed liquidation to critical failure of the protocol. And basically, if people are not locked up, well, if I see an issue happening, I just unstake and flee away. And the whole point of the safety module is that you get the yields. So basically the protocol incentive in exchange of a responsibility. It's not free money. There's no such thing as free money.
00:54:31.674 - 00:55:01.254, Speaker B: It's like a real responsibility. And the way to enforce that responsibility is to have the lockup period and the cooldown period to withdraw. Ten days was the initial setup. And I also agree it's a bit long. It's quite long. And I think in Defi, we should not be locked up for a longer period of time, and it will be up to the governance. Know that we have governance with you, that anybody can go to governance dot aave.com
00:55:01.254 - 00:55:25.990, Speaker B: and say, okay, ten days is too long. I prefer seven days or I prefer three days, or I prefer 12 hours, and then have a discussion, open discussion with the other token holders about that, and then have a vote. And whatever is voted is enforce it. That's the whole point of Defi. We are decentralized. You don't have to ask the team. You just have to organize and propose solutions and have a vote for it.
00:55:26.890 - 00:55:39.684, Speaker C: Definitely no. Excellent. Thanks for that answer. Let me see. I had another question in regards to. I actually disagree with that comment about free money. Thanks to uni, we did get free money.
00:55:39.684 - 00:56:21.446, Speaker C: Whoever uses service, you know, like, they got free unique coins. So that's there for debate. But in regards to flash, like, I saw version two, it looks great, but there's not a flash loan option, you know, for like a new user. You know, when you look at all your options, like, you don't see flash loan. So it's like, you know, I want to participate, me speaking, you know, generally. Also, it's like, where's that option? You know, like, how do I do it? You know, it becomes to a point where it gets too technical of how to execute, you know, such a trade. So just kind of like a suggestion, I'd be great to kind of, again, for new users, for anybody who's joining just to kind of see it there, you know, and understand a step by step of how to do it.
00:56:21.446 - 00:56:55.842, Speaker C: But, um, you know, again, even with one inch, and you guys probably come, you know, everything that you're doing, I think it's great for the end users. I just think, you know, in regards to, um, presentation, you know, not to present it, a way of like, here are all these coins, here are these apy. And it's just like, wait a second. Like, what is this? You know, like, so then we got to go to defi, dad, to find out I got to go to this service. You know, it becomes to a point, you know, where it's like, wait a second. This is just overwhelming. This is too much.
00:56:55.842 - 00:57:24.552, Speaker C: So, you know, I look forward to the day, you know, to be able to kind of like, accessibility and user wise just, it'll be just like opening up, you know, a Twitter account or opening any type of social account where it's kind of, you know, more seamless process. But, um, you know, I commend you guys, you know, and everything that you're doing in the work. And let's. I can think of a lot of questions, but like I said, you know, I don't want to. I don't want it. I don't want it to be about me. But I appreciate this.
00:57:24.552 - 00:57:26.180, Speaker C: This has been very, very cool.
00:57:27.080 - 00:57:48.720, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the flesh on thing. We should invite Fiona to. To article next time. She's like an expert of any kinds of flashlight, flash mean flash loan, flash flesh loan, and then she write a lot of posted about any kinds of flash loan. So she's like a flex expert besides the team. Yeah.
00:57:51.060 - 00:57:55.800, Speaker C: My coins and her charge me a fee and her do the post lane for me.
00:57:56.240 - 00:57:59.864, Speaker B: What do what say?
00:57:59.912 - 00:58:16.248, Speaker C: I'll say it again. Like, can I hire her? That's the thing. Like, I think it would be pretty cool to have somebody who specializes, like, in a certain field and someone just hire them, say, look, here's my die. Here's my ivy. Let's. Let's split yield, because at the end of the day, becomes a game, you know, becomes a game of. Of getting yields.
00:58:16.248 - 00:58:19.580, Speaker C: Like, you're not collecting coins in Mario brothers, but you're collecting you.
00:58:20.040 - 00:59:29.130, Speaker B: So that that's something really important you are saying here, Richard. And, like, before fuel combo, basically only people with development skill were accessible, were in the possibility to access those yield opportunities, swaps opportunities, or they had to do, like, eight, seven or eight different transactions to do all this kind of stuff. Thanks to Ferracombo, you don't need to have code. You just build blocks and do your stuff. I remember that on Twitter, like, last year, or at the beginning of Defi, I was doing this long trade saying, okay, you have money on compound, so you can deposit money on it on mega diode, then do that to borrow die, then do that to provide liquidity on compound, then swap the yield on something else to do this. And it was like eight or nine trade, long tweet, long trade, no ferro combo. You empire your blocks, you eat connect wallet, you eat send.
00:59:29.130 - 00:59:33.626, Speaker B: And one transaction, it's done. And it's a huge improvement already.
00:59:33.698 - 00:59:34.430, Speaker F: I think.
00:59:34.770 - 00:59:55.588, Speaker C: The way I see it, though, is like, Siri shortcut. So you got Siri shortcut, right? You can probably program it to do this, then that, all these steps. But my whole thing is you probably took an hour, well, let's say half an hour tops to create this cubes. So I say, you know what? Let me save mark that half an hour. Let me save this person. Here's the cube. That's it.
00:59:55.588 - 01:00:16.190, Speaker C: You know, like, here are all those steps here, everything that I put together, and here it is. But make it to the point where if I have somebody in the Philippines and Africa, anywhere, and it's like, look, you don't have $20. I just gave you $20. Here's how you can earn 40% apy on that, you know, and it's just like. And to them, it's just like, wait, do I just click here? And it's like, yeah, just click there. Yeah.
01:00:16.230 - 01:01:16.416, Speaker A: Speaking of getting, getting an idea of how you can trade, we are going to read something still cool in Q, one that you don't need to explore by yourself. And, yeah, so we have more and more features that are coming out this month, next month, next year. So, yeah, definitely stay tuned on fruit combos, Twitter, and also, of course, follow Aave and one inch and put together social media to know more about what's going on on Defi because everyone is trying hard to build a lot of cool features and user friendly features. I think this is the end of our communico. We will hold our next communico in January, maybe like middle of January, and we will still keep inviting different protocols to join our community call and share their progress with everyone. Because Defi is about compatibility, it's about community. And also everyone cooperate together.
01:01:16.416 - 01:01:34.516, Speaker A: So our community call is everyone's community call. Thanks everyone for joining our fur combo Defi community call. And yep, have a good night. Good morning. Good afternoon. Bye, guys.
01:01:34.588 - 01:01:35.172, Speaker F: Thanks.
01:01:35.316 - 01:01:38.540, Speaker B: Bye. Thank you so much, everyone. See you soon, guys.
