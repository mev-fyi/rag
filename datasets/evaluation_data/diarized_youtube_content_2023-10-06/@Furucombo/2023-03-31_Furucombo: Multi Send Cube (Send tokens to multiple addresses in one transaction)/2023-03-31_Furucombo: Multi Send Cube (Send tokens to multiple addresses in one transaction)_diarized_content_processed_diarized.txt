00:00:01.080 - 00:00:50.400, Speaker A: Hello. In this video I will demonstrate how to use the new froo combo multisend cube. This is useful if you want to send token to multiple addresses, members of a Dao for example, or your friends, or just to diversify risk out of a wallet that contains a lot of tokens. So first you'll go into create mode and select the network of your choice on the top right of. For me I'll use ethereum and then ensure your wallet is connected from here, hit the plus sign on the cube in the center and go down to utility and look for multisend. Here's the multisend cube. It'll ask for an input token which you can import as a custom token as well with an address or select from the drop down menu.
00:00:50.400 - 00:01:37.830, Speaker A: Then you can choose as many addresses as you wish and the token amount. You can also click this to save your address history so you don't have to enter this again every time. Additionally, you can also import as a CSV file. So here I have a list of addresses. The way we're going to set this up is it's going to be address comma and then token amount. So here's my addresses. From here I'm going to add however many tokens I wish to send on each of these and then I'm going to save this and I'm going to ensure that I save it as a CSV file.
00:01:37.830 - 00:02:27.360, Speaker A: Now we can take that list of addresses and we can import it directly into the multisen queue. Now I have the five addresses that was in the CSV file with the token amounts I added on there. Ensure you have the right input token. And now this is ready. If you're happy with this, you can set this. And additionally, anytime you want to change that address history, you can do so by the expanding icon here and you can choose my wallets and you can adjust any of the values here without re importing your CSV file. So you can then adjust these values, adjust these addresses, add new addresses, add new values and then reset that.
00:02:27.360 - 00:02:30.260, Speaker A: And that's how you use the multisencube.
