00:00:19.280 - 00:00:59.970, Speaker A: Thank you everyone for attending this episode of Fruit Radio on L2 scaling solutions. So super happy to have you here and definitely glad to have all our special guests as well. We have Liam and Orest from Scroll, Ashwari and soon Hamza from Polygon and dosh from gnosis chain. So we can kind of just get into it. We'll do maybe a brief introduction, you can kind of introduce yourself a little bit about your project and then we can kind of get into what you're building and the topic at hand. So L2 scaling solutions. So maybe we can start with this role team then and you guys can just kind of introduce yourself in a brief about your project.
00:01:04.160 - 00:01:40.160, Speaker B: Yeah, no worries. I guess I can kind of go first. So my name is Liam. I'm the community manager here at scroll. Basically I handle everything on obviously the community and marketing front. So anything from discord to social media and just like our general community growth strategy, hosting regular community AMA's and that sort of thing, basically what scroll is, is what we're building is a fully EVM equivalent ZK roll up. And we're basically aiming to be one of the most developer friendly scaling solutions, I guess kind of available in the ZK landscape.
00:01:40.160 - 00:01:43.800, Speaker B: I guess I'll pass over to orest.
00:01:45.540 - 00:02:21.220, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Thank you, Liam. This is arrest. I am doing infra at scroll. I guess Liam gave a quick intro. One thing we'd like to add on top, maybe, is that our idea of becoming the developer friendly go to solution is by being able to leverage all of the ecosystem, utilities, documentation and so on via being EVM equivalent. And so we now like to call what we do the native ckevm.
00:02:26.310 - 00:02:30.770, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Thanks guys. And then I guess Ashwari from Polygon.
00:02:31.430 - 00:02:56.662, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So thank you, Blazer for having me here. When we talk about. So a little bit about me, I basically currently am handling all the fintech side at Polygon. So you, you can name the biggest fintechs in the world right now. And most of them, like right now I'm connected with them and we are building, like, we are having conversations on building and polygon. Most of these like later during the year we will be able to go out and see.
00:02:56.662 - 00:03:49.700, Speaker D: So that is what my role is basically here when we talk about polygon. So polygon, we look polygon as like as a swiss knife for ethereum, where instead of like what our approach to the, to the scaling word is. So every kind of business or every kind of user base or every kind of, let's say, work or enterprise actually needs to have a different kind of solution. They cannot, like, everyone has a different kind of requirements. Everyone has a different kind of needs out there, and everyone actually is going ahead and having a different set of requirements. And that is where Polygon comes in. So polygon, where we have a suite of seven solutions that are out there which basically caters to every segment of user base, be it an enterprise, be it a defi protocol or let's say a fintech or a gaming NFT and all those things.
00:03:49.700 - 00:04:09.330, Speaker D: So some of the solutions that we have live are pos chain, polygon, edge and supernets. We also have the Polygon Nightfall beta live, and then Polygon zero maiden. And actually the Polygon ZK EVM is something that is like very near to the launch. So most of them are on the testnets.
00:04:12.950 - 00:04:13.414, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:04:13.462 - 00:04:16.610, Speaker A: Thanks. And last but not least, dosh from gnosis.
00:04:17.030 - 00:04:44.090, Speaker E: Hey Blazer, thank you very much. Hi everyone. I am dosh from gnosis. I do ecosystem development as well as business development for them. I've been developing on Gnosis, the Xi chain, for roughly, I don't know, about three years now. So I'm not super new to this space. And in terms of what gnosis is developing, essentially we're trying to be the home of Daos.
00:04:44.090 - 00:05:36.290, Speaker E: So all kinds of dao tooling, public goods, all those kind of things are kind of our main demographic now. In terms of scaling solutions, we do have one, sorry, we have two, but we're mostly supporting one, and that's optimistic roll ups. And we recently funded a gip for a team called Dark Forest, and they have been deploying on this optimistic roll up. And essentially during this, it's essentially a game. And during the start of the game they have on chain interactions. And the first round they did had about 86,000 TX's versus the mainnet had only about 76,000. It went really well.
00:05:36.290 - 00:05:44.610, Speaker E: So we're looking forward more to see the development and the use cases for optimistic roll ups on gnosis.
00:05:47.030 - 00:05:47.542, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:05:47.606 - 00:05:47.942, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:05:48.006 - 00:06:59.640, Speaker A: So thank you very much, everyone, for the introduction there. So just want to take a step back and kind of talk about why we need these L2 scaling solutions and kind of what they are. I'm of course, no expert, but just kind of talking from a general market perspective. So in 2021, we kind of saw that with the explosion of the crypto market and all these transactions happening on Ethereum, that we saw a rise in gas prices. So at that point in time, we saw a lot of these side chains, or like pos chains spawning from that increase in gas price. And a lot of the transactions and went to side chains, polygon, pos, phantom, avalanche, all those kind of side networks, gnosis. So, you know, what is different, then about these L2 scaling solutions? Why do we need these L2 scaling solutions? And what is it doing that's above and beyond what we've seen already today? So that's kind of where I want to open the discussion and talk about as transactions are getting verified on these, on the main chain from these L2s.
00:06:59.640 - 00:07:31.018, Speaker A: That's kind of like the benefit, right? So do we see that as like a step above kind of the L2 solutions or, sorry, the poly or the PoS chains? And then kind of, how do we see the network evolving or ethereum evolving using these L2 solutions? So anyone can kind of jump in. Feel free to discuss kind of, you know, the first question there, I can.
00:07:31.114 - 00:08:26.170, Speaker E: Open it up here a little bit. So let's talk a little bit about the actual scaling solutions like gnosis and polygon. So if it wasn't for gnosis and polygon, and of course, all the other side chains that have helped this kind of ecosystem grow, we wouldn't have a lot of these apps, right? There's a lot of apps that essentially you can't use on Mainnet when I, you know, you have two and $300 worth of gas trying to make, you know, one action actually happen. And I believe last time I checked the numbers, there was about 203 million unique addresses on ethereum, and that's about 22% up from the year before. And, you know, DeFi is around 2.3% of that. So if DeFi is only 2.3%
00:08:26.170 - 00:09:02.108, Speaker E: of that. And of course, you got to include the NFT market as well in there. And we already have problems with gas on Ethereum. It would be crazy to say that we can scale Ethereum to the point where we want to include most parts of the world. We got 7 billion people on the planet. You know, you're going to be looking at $10,000 gas prices if everyone was on Ethereum. So I don't think you could see, you know, crypto develop without side chains.
00:09:02.108 - 00:09:11.960, Speaker E: Like, it just. It wouldn't be possible, especially with. With, you know, how, how vast and how much use case it brings to the. To the current world.
00:09:14.500 - 00:09:55.156, Speaker D: And just to, like, build on to that particular thing when you look at, like today, all these L2s evolving. So even with the merge. So one of the, one of the myths that a lot of people have currently is that post merge Ethereum will have a huge DP's and gas prices will fall down and everything like that. So that also does not actually is true. Like the gas fees going relatively down and there will be no need for l two s. And like even post like merge, the TPS that we are expecting for Ethereum is somewhere around 10,000. And with using these layer tools and everything that's so even let's remove the L2s here.
00:09:55.156 - 00:11:06.030, Speaker D: So having 10,000 transactions per day, imagine like bringing a game on blockchain and that game which is like, let's say EA, EA game, EA sports game or something like that. And that means that that single game can go ahead and consume all the block space here. So when, when we talk about L two's, their contribution towards evolving the Ethereum ecosystem will always be out there and anyone and everyone, like I've been like seeing this evolution from like when we were just a plasma chain. So if you look at it like we were just like a plasma chain going out, batch processing the transactions and putting it on Ethereum, that was where we started. And as the, as we understood that the world needs a lot of more solutions. So those kinds of things bringing in. So today, as we look at it, we look at Ethereum as being the settlement layer and l two, or polygon as being one of the biggest contributor towards the layer which is doing the transactions, or you can say transaction layer and then rolling it up to its ethereum as and when required, so that we keep on imbibing the security that Ethereum provides.
00:11:17.410 - 00:11:27.910, Speaker A: Right on, right on. So, yeah, so basically, you know, L2's help to scale Ethereum, but then also keeping the security of the main chain of Ethereum.
00:11:31.000 - 00:11:32.060, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:11:33.400 - 00:11:45.460, Speaker B: Yeah. I think security is like, you guys pretty much hit it on the head. Like security is probably, it is the most important factor when talking about scalability. I guess the way I kind of look at it as well is.
00:11:47.160 - 00:11:47.616, Speaker A: Even.
00:11:47.688 - 00:12:09.040, Speaker B: Other layer one side chains and that even if they do kind of eventually warrant the same significant demand for block space that Ethereum does, there's no doubt that they'll also eventually run into the scalability problem as well. So it just makes sense for roll ups to be able to just handle transactions off chain and just outsource their security to layer one. Ethereum.
00:12:14.940 - 00:12:35.750, Speaker A: Gotcha. So do you guys foresee a world then where people aren't even transacting on Ethereum, they're basically just doing everything on a L2 and then these L2s are just batching transactions or processing transactions on Ethereum as like a transactional layer. And basically you wouldn't be doing any kind of actions on there, on defi, on gaming, on anything like that.
00:12:37.890 - 00:13:22.620, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Like, I think most like Dapps and applications altogether will live at L2. Like it'll just become like, it won't be feasible for anyone to really like build on layer one. I don't think in the long term, like fees like are just going to, as we move into like more and more bull markets, fees will just continue to rise at layer one. So it's pretty much, yeah, I think going forward, over the next two plus years, we're just going to start seeing a lot of Dapps deploying natively on L2 as well. I think synthetix, for example, is a good example of an app that was kind of crippled at layer one. And now you see them kind of gaining lots of traction again since moving to optimism and being kind of a pioneer of L2 scaling solutions there.
00:13:27.180 - 00:14:25.810, Speaker C: And then maybe to add to this, I guess the big question right now remains, can I trustlessly, permissionlessly exit from an l two, for instance, onto ethereum? And as long as this is not resolved, I think there will be use cases where layer one prevails, where people want and are willing to accept the significantly higher fees in exchange for the security guarantees. But then the big turning point could be setting up an l two and seeing it in action, actually deployed out in the wild where you have all of those permissionless exit guarantees, decentralization and so on. I think that could be a turning point.
00:14:34.390 - 00:14:35.970, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a very good point.
00:14:39.750 - 00:15:06.632, Speaker D: I think. I agree. Like exit is something which is very important. And like currently, if you, if you look at that exit point on polygon that's very much available, the POS bridge itself goes out and provides that exit point. And like within minutes you can actually go out and create an exit from the polygon chain directly to the main chain. So that is something which I completely agree to and it also depends upon the solution that you're using. So one of the research papers that I have contributed on scaling.
00:15:06.632 - 00:15:44.584, Speaker D: So there are various types of like scaling solutions which are there and nothing, everyone. So let's say this is majorly with optimistic roll ups where we have, like you, we have. So there are various types of scaling solutions. I would say some, like, one is optimistic 1 second one is deterministic one. So with optimistic, what happens is we, we feel that everything is good and while we are doing the transaction, but while we are exiting, what happens is we have to ensure that, that there is no fraud committed on the chain. So there is a lag period which is available. But I think today the solutions for them is also there.
00:15:44.584 - 00:16:12.670, Speaker D: But like majorly, if you look at polygon per se, these kinds of exit are very easily available on the main chain. If you want to exit, if you want to come to the polygon chain, I think the PoS bridge today does that. And having on the ethereum ecosystem, if you look at the biggest bridge or biggest asset, biggest bridge, which is based on the total volume it holds on. So Polygon Bridge is, I think the at the top right now for the ethereum ecosystem.
00:16:22.810 - 00:17:54.950, Speaker A: Awesome. So yeah, I mean, just to take a step back for maybe someone that doesn't know kind of what these L2 solutions are, we're kind of right now with the ZK roll up versus optimistic roll up. So it seems like optimistic rollups kind of came out first. It's technically easier to institute that scaling solution because, you know, it's just you can, if there's a fault in one of the transactions, someone can check it and then kind of put a, I think they called a fault proof against the transaction and then people can go back and check on that. Whereas Zkrollp's more technically difficult to implement because, you know, it's done automatically in a batch transaction. So, you know, those are the two solutions we have right now. I mean, what are the problems, I guess, are we going to see a different kind of solution? Are these kind of the two that we have right now? Is there maybe a third? And then what are the problems with adoption? You know, you guys had mentioned I, bringing Dapps over could be difficult if there's a bunch of different L2s, are we left with the same problem we had beside chains? Whereas now we have fragmentation between these different L2s and now there's issues because liquidity is on all these different chains, or is there a way to communicate with these L2s? And then is there other problems that we see with L2s over, say, just using a POS chain or maybe the main chain? What do you guys think about that?
00:17:55.410 - 00:18:44.060, Speaker D: I think that's a very good question as well. Like why do we need various solutions or different types of solutions? So my answer to this would be we require this because there are different needs and different requirements which people have basically when, when they are going out and utilizing it. So let's say an NFT project might have a completely different thought process while they are going out and rolling out or finding a particular solution. And on the other hand, you might have different other solutions which might like let's say a defi protocol or a fintech or an enterprise going and rolling out. So they might have a complete different version of requirements that are there. So that is why I think these kinds of solutions will always exist. And it would not be like there's one perfect solution for scalability that would never be there.
00:18:44.060 - 00:19:16.172, Speaker D: So that is, I think, biggest one. That being said, we want to talk about what are the different types of layer tools. So one is like the state channels which are there. So we have like a ride in network or seller out there. Then we have like the plasma child chains which are there for which like polygon actually started with, which was matic earlier. Then you have like the side chains, and then you have the roll ups. In roll ups you have like two examples which I told you like one was optimistic roll up and the other was deterministic roll up.
00:19:16.172 - 00:20:03.280, Speaker D: So optimistic roll up, just to give a little bit of context, is something where every, like to explain with a layman term is like you don't need to actually go out and mathematically prove that every transaction is happening correctly and there is no fault. You process those transactions on the chain. But when you are exiting that chain, what happens is there's a time period which is given out. And based on that time period which is given out, what happens is in this time period, if someone goes out and challenges this particular transaction that has been done by this address, then what happens is you lose. And that that charge is proven. Then basically you are caught and you do not, you are not allowed to exit. On the other hand, if you look at like the deterministic roll ups which are there.
00:20:03.280 - 00:20:30.412, Speaker D: So deterministic roll ups work on a like a different and different way altogether, which are also known as zero knowledge proof roll ups. And these are basically where you run all your computations and off chain and submit a validity proof on ethereum. There are various ways to use that. We currently use plonky two to generate these proofs currently. So that is there. And basically this is something which is again there and here. Then the last one is very.
00:20:30.412 - 00:21:04.908, Speaker D: So if you, I don't know if anyone has heard of that, but is also there. But what what happens is data is data is kept off chain instead of sending it on the Ethereum main chain with in a way polygon avail is doing. And where what happens is all the data is because being kept off chain, they can have a higher TPS. Somewhere around 20,000 transactions is something which is there an example is like stockware where they are trying to do it. And this is exactly which Polygon ZKVM athlete as well as Polygon avail is trying to do. So, I mean, different types of solutions are required. They would 100% be required.
00:21:04.908 - 00:21:35.620, Speaker D: And there are various kinds of requirements which require them. Then coming to the next question, which is like, how do everyone communicate? And everything like that, I think there's not a perfect solution right now. If you look at Polkadot currently, Polkadot is like creating the parachains, and with that you have parathreads through which you can actually go out and communicate. So that's one. Then usually on other chains we are relying on bridges. But is it perfect? I have no answer to that yet.
00:21:39.480 - 00:22:43.740, Speaker C: I think I allow myself to disagree about this kind of truism statement that, yeah, there's going to be different requirements and different use cases, and so different solutions will be around. I disagree with specifically the kind of parallel existence rationale for optimistic and ZK rollups. Because once we have ZK roll ups that are computationally feasible, and maybe the maths have advanced a bit more and the hardware is even better, I don't think there will be a reason to keep optimistic roll ups around just because of the finality delay that will be needed just theoretically, as you described, in order to give a chance to create a fault proof, fraud proof.
00:22:50.250 - 00:23:37.120, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting point, actually. And personally myself, I see, I can kind of see where you're coming from arrest and maybe optimistic roll ups are a stepping stone to ZK, to something more robust. Right. I think maybe the benefit of that is you don't have to do many batch transactions, or I guess maybe, I don't know if they do any transactions onto the Ethereum main chain. So in the event that you have, you know, high gas fees at the moment, you know, maybe you're saving some of those network fees. Like, I'm not sure, maybe someone else can answer about ZK roll ups if the batch transactions have to be done at a certain time. And then there's the option, maybe, of having an extremely high gas fee at that moment to complete those transactions on the main chain.
00:23:38.660 - 00:24:41.910, Speaker C: Well, that's a design choice. That's a design choice and something that could be done even dynamically. So the way you can envision batch transactions is that you get to pick how many you batch, how strong you compress. And so I think the interesting bit about ZK rollups at this point is how do you get them computationally feasible in the first place. I think that's where the cost of creating proofs, validity proofs, I think that's this interesting bottleneck, and that's where you need capital, you need input, and it's probably diminishing. And the Gatsbys are probably diminishing when you compare them to creating the validity proof.
00:24:55.540 - 00:25:06.320, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So we can close up kind of on that and go to the next topic here, which is does ETH 2.0 change anything for scaling solutions?
00:25:08.390 - 00:25:38.510, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, it does. So the ETH 2.0 I think is per se, we are not supposed to call it that way. But the merge prepares pave sway for dunkshotting, which I think is just a super cool thing for any roll ups out there because of lowering the data storage costs so badly. So I think that's super interesting to every roll up out there.
00:25:43.250 - 00:26:14.080, Speaker D: I think when you, when you look at the ETH merge happening on the structure level, there is not much change. But I not say there's not any change which is there. So changes are gonna be there, but they won't be like something of a, like a way, like on, on the language or on the, on the way in which like we create contracts and everything today there's, there will be, obviously, because we are changing the consensus mechanism. Those kinds of kinds of changes will definitely happen.
00:26:24.060 - 00:26:33.760, Speaker A: So, Aorus, maybe you want to expand a little bit on the storage capacity change. So how, what, by what factors does that increase by?
00:26:37.060 - 00:27:50.930, Speaker C: I'm not sure about the exact factors, but maybe to give a bigger picture here, the very idea of a roll up as opposed to, in contrast and to a validium, is that you get to store all of the data that is needed to basically recreate, see the transactions that happened in the roll up on the l one. And so this way you get a lot of permissionless, etcetera, way easier. And because of that also, it is that right now, putting this data onto the roll up onto the l one makes the roll up kind of expensive. Now with dunkshotting data will be way, way cheaper. And so this will, I think, speed up, accelerate the adoption of roll ups and pave way for production. Ready mainnets.
00:27:59.960 - 00:28:40.760, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. So I just want to jump in a little bit into maybe the kind of, I don't know if ZK sync kind of pioneered this idea, but the idea of like a volition or being able to bundle a couple of different networks together so you can kind of cross communicate between them. And that's kind of around the idea of scaling these L2s and, you know, not having fragmentation. So have you guys kind of thought about, you know, a way to cross communicate with different networks? Or, or maybe you want to expand on a little bit of the idea of like a volition?
00:28:52.910 - 00:28:55.410, Speaker D: Can you come again? Sorry, I think I lost twice.
00:28:57.830 - 00:29:34.630, Speaker A: Yeah, so like, as I understand it, like a volition is a hybrid solution which kind of allows kind of application specific networks to communicate between each other through like, data availability between different networks. So I think Zksync is working on something like that. I'm just wondering what you guys think of in terms of communicating between these different L2s and how you kind of avoid this fragmentation that we've seen with these current setup with all these different side chains.
00:29:37.410 - 00:29:55.650, Speaker D: I think that is something which we will have to wait for and watch because currently, once the solutions are live, then that is the next step would be this. But currently, I think anything said would only be based on hypothesis. So I would not take to like, take it easier.
00:29:57.470 - 00:30:00.210, Speaker C: Do you mean stockwise volition?
00:30:04.910 - 00:30:07.014, Speaker A: I'm not sure if they're doing that setup.
00:30:07.062 - 00:30:45.940, Speaker C: I think. Yeah, so I'm familiar with StarCraft volition, which is basically a more dynamic and customizable way of selecting how much data availability do I want? And I think that's independent of the question of interoperability. I think the question of interoperability and for instance, composability of the apps, that's a separate one. And it's actually made possible by EVM equivalents of some roll ups.
00:30:47.960 - 00:31:20.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I think immutable x is a good example because I think they at the moment use Starquare's validium, but eventually they'll evolve into a volition where they can basically switch, but the user can basically switch between validium and roll up mode. I think that's how it works. And the validium obviously just posts proof layer one and not data, whereas the roll up does. So it's just about whichever one the user is happy to use at the time.
00:31:23.250 - 00:31:34.970, Speaker A: Yes, that's right. Yeah, thank you for that. The user, I guess, can decide how much, you know, security they want to take on, and maybe something that's slightly less secure will have more scalability.
00:31:36.430 - 00:32:26.200, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how it kind of plays out in the long run, actually, because once, like general purpose, like full blown ZK roll ups are out in like full swing. And like, you know, one day when we do have like, sub $0.05, sub $0.01 transactions, like, what even is the difference in cost between like a validium and a roll up. Then like you might as well just go with the roll up pay the have 100% Ethereum security, so it'll be interesting to see how it plays out. But yeah, at the moment it's pretty cool. The user's going to have the choice in the short term, I guess the short to medium term, because maybe for an everyday user, for example, if they come online and they want to buy a $10 NFT, then they're probably going to prefer to use the volydium or something maybe quite a bit cheaper.
00:32:26.200 - 00:32:27.692, Speaker B: We'll see.
00:32:27.756 - 00:32:49.880, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. And I think it tends to get a bit messy to speak about scalability, as in validium being more scalable. At this point, it's probably going to be more of a question of price that the user is willing to pay for having the data availability security of the l one.
00:32:53.430 - 00:33:40.580, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. Like ultimately it's basically a race to zero dollar fees while also like upholding a high ethereum level security. So very, very interesting. But I think like as Oress said before, like after, like, I think we have like proto deng sharding first, which is I believe ERP 48 44 next year. If I'm kind of explaining this right, that's kind of like placing like infrastructure for like full tank sharding, which will come later on unlocking like further scalability for roll ups and that sort of thing. So yeah, I mean, ZK roll ups are going to become so cheap regardless, kind of, you know, when Ethereum moves like further towards I guess, layer one scalability roadmap. So, yeah, we'll see.
00:33:44.080 - 00:34:03.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good point too. You know, from what I've seen so far, you know, maybe not a lot of people care so much about the security or they just want to continue doing what they're doing. So, you know, how do, how do we make the push to get people to L2s? And is that important or is that just the natural progression of things and that's something we're going to see?
00:34:06.330 - 00:34:51.479, Speaker C: I don't think it's true that people don't care about security. I think there is, um, a lot of exposure these days to uh, well, just scams and also bugs, basically. Um, and I think people do care and I think there's a lot of trust that a brand first just being well known is something that people trust. But it does feel to me as though we are in the early days and that trustless like brand independent security guarantees are something that will and are already appealing to broader and broader masses of people.
00:34:59.979 - 00:35:22.150, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe to kind of build on that a bit, you know, seeing the protocols go to these networks is kind of, you think, what will drive people to go there? So like, say, uniswap, launching on a ZK roll up? And then now that gives people the option. They know the brand, they know the name, they trust the network, and then that's what's going to drive adoption.
00:35:23.690 - 00:35:24.950, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%.
00:35:28.530 - 00:35:53.620, Speaker C: But ideally in the second one, will it be that users will see, oh, I can go on this roll up and I can do like, I can run a swap trustlessly. I don't need to trust the roll up operator. I don't need to trust the sequence and so on. And so I think that is going to be an argument in favor of such solutions.
00:36:04.650 - 00:36:06.350, Speaker A: Did you want to add something there, Liam?
00:36:07.570 - 00:36:09.994, Speaker B: No, I think arrested there.
00:36:10.162 - 00:36:12.450, Speaker A: Okay, perfect. No, no.
00:36:12.490 - 00:36:13.310, Speaker B: So good.
00:36:17.850 - 00:37:01.280, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So we can kind of go to the last question, I think here we've discussed everything else, and so kind of, you know, what's the future then for the ethereum network? You know, we have, I think this roll up stuff, this L2 stuff is kind of the first step. And then kind of, you know, Vitalik moves into this idea of like, plasma or like different, you know, I don't profess to know too much about plasma, but different kind of chains interacting at the same time with each other, maybe main chains. Right? So, you know, when plasma is live, for instance, do we still need these L2s? You know, how do we kind of see the network growing over the next, you know, three to five years?
00:37:05.220 - 00:37:30.480, Speaker C: Well, Vitalik has made it pretty clear that he sees a roll up centric future for Ethereum. And so I think that l two s are here to stay and there will be even more layers on top making fees and, you know, this like, maybe cheap and low security dependent dapps even more accessible.
00:37:45.860 - 00:37:57.570, Speaker A: Any other thoughts on, on that from polygon or gnosis? And welcome hams. I just seen you join here.
00:37:59.790 - 00:38:00.078, Speaker C: Hey.
00:38:00.094 - 00:38:47.488, Speaker F: Hey, guys, sorry, I was stuck on a bunch of calls I could not join earlier. Thanks, Blazar, for having me. Thank you, guys. Yeah, for us, I think just to add on that, I think security definitely matters. So decentralization and security definitely matters. You can see this even today with the trade size on different chains versus Ethereum, different chains versus, versus polygon. You can look at, you can look at all the x numbers, you can look at one inch numbers, paras, those are clear indicators of where the big, big ticket size is comfortable with where they, you can clearly see that.
00:38:47.488 - 00:39:42.666, Speaker F: So the indicators of the trend that, you know, layer the, layer one, the trade that was happening last year is pretty much dead right now. And these are, these, I'm not, I'm not saying this out of the blue, like you can look at on chain numbers and you'll see how the data is going down for alt, layer one usage. And it is clear that, you know, L2s are the, are the way, keeping in mind after the merge and all of that, the layer tools are clearly in, you know, just getting started, especially with, with ZKe, Vm, with scroll, even what we are going to do in the next couple of months. So yeah, I think it's, it'll be pretty exciting. And more importantly, I think, I think dev, like, user, users follow devs and not the other way around. Like, I mean, yes, other way around also. But I think devs will go where, you know, security is there.
00:39:42.666 - 00:40:12.464, Speaker F: Good. Devs will go where security is there and where they can build sustainable products. You can clearly see this with Ethereum and the polygon relationship. Like, you know, Polygon was the first place where these blue chip protocols had expanded out. And, you know, we'll see that same thing with GKe that will come. That will happen. So, yeah, I mean, we'll build good stuff, then users will fall and then users will, you know, inhabited.
00:40:12.464 - 00:40:29.590, Speaker F: Their place will come. So it's this, how we have played this, like this industry has grown and, yeah, from bitcoin to Ethereum, from Ethereum to, you know, player tools. And I think this will become more relevant in the, in the next few, in the next few quarter or earlier next year. Yeah.
00:40:31.450 - 00:40:36.042, Speaker E: Yeah, totally agree there with Thompson. Oh, sorry. Auris, go ahead.
00:40:36.226 - 00:41:07.740, Speaker C: I just wanted to reiterate. Yeah, absolutely. I think the devx is terrible right now and it's so hard for developers to enter the space. So not to mention users. I think that I have very high hopes and that Devex is going to improve and this is going to draw more developers into the ecosystem and this is going to create more Dapps and better UX and that is going to draw more users, actual end users into the ecosystem. Absolutely.
00:41:10.000 - 00:41:58.450, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. Agree with your point there, oras. I think once we get a little bit more traction in like main markets, like what you see, I don't know if you guys are keeping up with Reddit and Arbitrum. Essentially they partner together along with FTX. Now, as you're seeing these more common use technologies from web two kind of starting to transition to web3. I think we're going to start seeing a lot more users coming on, at least for, I don't know about devs, but, but for users trying to experience what is this cryptocurrency and what's happening and you see it quite a bit with communities and then you're going to see it in games as well. Like nFts are a thing.
00:41:58.450 - 00:42:54.150, Speaker E: And I keep hearing like big AAA games are having complete crypto sectors now, trying to integrate blockchain technology. And with having like such an easy kind of ramp into say, I don't know, you just start playing a game, you kind of get interested and your friend says, hey, you know, we can sell our skins now. And it's like, okay, well, what can we buy? It's like you can buy whatever you want. So that's kind of bringing a lot more use case. And I think in the next wave or in the next bull run, whenever that happens, I think we're going to see a lot more retail market. Not, not nearly as crypto native people that are going to be kind of playing around on these blockchains. And I don't know if you guys saw, but when they were playing around, all the Defi super crypto native people were playing around the chains, we bogged down pretty much every network.
00:42:54.150 - 00:43:31.920, Speaker E: So yeah, if you're starting to introduce millions of users, it's going to be crazy and it's going to be awesome. Yeah, definitely L2s, I could say like, you know, even L2s built on top of L2s, if that's, if that's a thing, is going to be something that will definitely be used for applications that have a lot of traction, a lot of traffic, because at the end of the day, if you're paying a dollar for a transaction, you want to bring it down to a cent, quarter of a cent or a hundredth of a cent and you have, you know, millions of users on it, you're still going to need to build something on top of that.
00:43:34.610 - 00:43:37.350, Speaker C: L three s, l four s. Absolutely.
00:43:40.890 - 00:44:00.302, Speaker A: Yeah. How deep can you go here? But, yeah, that's a good point. Just, you know, I guess application specific chains. Right. Or you know, different chains for different use cases, you know, as Polygon said, you know, they're creating many chains.
00:44:00.426 - 00:44:46.182, Speaker F: Yeah. Wanted to add one thing. Yeah, sorry to interrupt, Warren on the, um, on the, what do you call, uh, uh, the web two side of things, uh, as you can know, like right now, um, yeah, everything was pretty good. They are doing the moons, uh, thing on um, on, uh, on, on arbitrum, they have launched the NFT marketplace and they're calling it avatar marketplace on Polygon. So that is, that is clearly happening. And you can see, you know, like why these change are these big, big companies which have, you know, millions of millions of users, user base. And like, you must have seen the Instagram, Instagram, Instagram integration on polygon for minting.
00:44:46.182 - 00:45:41.290, Speaker F: So it's exclusively minting on Ethereum and Polygon. So which is a, which is a big deal because like you clearly see why these, these big projects are not projects. I mean these are like what, top ten companies in the world choosing, choosing projects, choosing Ethereum, scaling solutions clearly with arbitram and Polygon right now. But of course this will go more up, go way up in the coming. That is one thing. And we, by early next month, I can give this alpha, I hope you don't share this outside, but we are announcing something bigger. We also teased it earlier, I think, last week or something in the consumer finance space.
00:45:41.290 - 00:46:32.630, Speaker F: So think of how Instagram did that for nfts on polygon. Something like that will also be on the defi side of things. This is a big, very big consumer fintech side. So I think because the next wave of users will not be crypto native people will either come from gaming or via these web two interfaces or these web two companies that clearly understand product design and product thinking more than us protocol designers on the inside. I like to, we like to think of ourselves as like very native protocol people. However, these product people that are coming from the web two space will, you know, are building better user experiences and, you know, seamless user experiences for people to come in. So.
00:46:32.630 - 00:46:34.410, Speaker F: Yeah, I just wanted to add that.
00:46:36.710 - 00:47:07.060, Speaker E: Yeah, totally. And also like the demographic too. Right? You know, you're not pertaining to people that are not really technology friendly anymore versus like, I don't know, my parents, for example, wouldn't really understand this, but when you're talking about the younger generations, you know, all kind of discussing nfts, you know, playing, playing video games and always having something with like crypto related stuff, you're going to see massive adoption within like five to ten years because it's just going to be a normal thing.
00:47:09.740 - 00:47:10.640, Speaker F: Totally.
00:47:11.020 - 00:47:18.000, Speaker C: But then again, maybe we don't need the blockchain for that. I'm not sure how far we should be stretching that.
00:47:21.700 - 00:47:23.640, Speaker E: In what terms do you mean by.
00:47:26.780 - 00:48:27.930, Speaker C: Well, there's many use cases where blockchains are not the optimal solution in terms of tech. And so I guess it's kind of easy to run into this trap of thinking, like, let's turn everything into an NFT. And I think that's what recently Instagram, for instance, started doing, like showcasing your JPEG NFTs. Probably not the ideal solution, probably it is that we are, we are finding ourselves in a time where people are playing around with use cases and it is very early, and I don't believe that many of them will stick. I think we need many more iterations and we need to find out what actually makes sense and where it makes sense for your parents or your grandparents not to understand the inner workings, but still use, let's say, adapt. Finance being a great example. I think that really makes sense.
00:48:30.480 - 00:49:16.750, Speaker E: I think, I agree and disagree at the same time. I think once the technology gets built out and it becomes a lot easier, maybe you won't even really know that you're interacting with blockchain, but with blockchain you're providing all the security and all those kind of things that in the web, two life would make life a lot harder. If you have any kind of finance or any kind of game within that, you know, it becomes very, very hard. But if you have built in fiat ramps, built in processors, you don't need to deal with getting any kind of licensing from visa or anything like that, which is like what's happening currently in any kind of tech companies.
00:49:19.930 - 00:49:57.780, Speaker C: Yeah. Although licensing is, I think, not the best example. I think the. And a better example of something we don't need is middleman. Cutting out the middleman. I think that's very clearly an advantage to every person, to the regular users, and we might need, we might want to have licensing nonetheless. But I think there's many use cases that are being elaborated on and tested around and played around with, such as certain use cases of JPEG NFTs that will not stick around and that's for the better.
00:50:04.800 - 00:50:58.510, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. Yeah, great discussion. Yeah, no, I just want to kind of iterate on the fact that, yeah, so you guys are building the L2, the infrastructure, and then now we're kind of seeing, hopefully these retail or larger institutions coming in and building their interfaces on top and kind of creating a seamless user experience. So I think all of that is interesting. It's a different kind of interaction that we've seen in the past where we just had a large user base, whereas now we're seeing these companies coming and build these easy to use interfaces so people can just interact with the backend without maybe, as Dosh mentioned, without even knowing they're interacting with blockchain or that they're kind of reaping the benefits of what's going on there. So, yeah, I mean, like we saw in early defi, there was a lot of protocols that were kind of useless or unneeded. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing now with nfts.
00:50:58.510 - 00:51:32.710, Speaker A: But as we transition, we bring in these retail institutions, we kind of define real use cases, maybe medical records, mortgages, that kind of things, into nfts or soul bound nfts. We can keep building on that. So I think this L2 solutions are kind of a step towards seeing the end result and the end goal of seeing a fully robust blockchain world or infrastructure. So definitely interesting to see where we go from here.
00:51:35.780 - 00:51:36.920, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:51:40.540 - 00:52:05.090, Speaker A: So I guess we've got a couple more minutes here. I just want to ask one more question, and do we see the way that the industry is now with the L2 solutions, with optimistic roll ups or ZK roll ups, that we've solved the blockchain trilemma, or do we still have a ways to go in solving this issue?
00:52:09.630 - 00:52:44.632, Speaker D: I think the Trilemma is something that is yet to be solved. I would say we are reaching as close as possible to solve this dilemma and. But if we. If we go out and say, have we solved it? I think a trelemma needs to be solved on, on. If we see preliminary to be solved as one chain that is yet not done, but if you see multiple chains coming up and solving the problem, then, yeah, it is kind of solved. If you look at layer tools, they are actually going out and solving for one issue that, that Ethereum has, which is scalability. So, yeah, if you combine both of them, it is solved.
00:52:44.632 - 00:53:03.430, Speaker D: If you look at, let's say, Polkadot ecosystem, the security is being provided by the Polkadot and parachains being building on that, then trilemma can be said in two chains coming together and solving the trilemma. That is done. But on an individual level, I don't think, like, any chain can go out and say that they have actually solved the problem.
00:53:08.610 - 00:53:26.010, Speaker C: I think we can't claim to have solved the trilemma as long as there's not at least a few, probably even mainnets functional out there in the wild. And that is not the case yet. So I think there's still a lot of work to be done.
00:53:31.310 - 00:53:53.514, Speaker A: For sure. For sure. I can agree with that. Well, we're heading towards the right direction anyways. So I think in these kind of bear markets or bear cycles, it's interesting to see these. I think that's where the most of the, you know, production is happening or evolution. So it's interesting to see where we're going to be in the next year or two.
00:53:53.514 - 00:54:22.040, Speaker A: But definitely still early for L2 scaling solutions. So if you haven't checked them out, check out scroll, check out polygon, check out gnosis chain, and then everyone who attended here today will receive a oat. So we do have a form that you need to fill out on our Twitter. So head over to the fru combo Twitter and then you can put in your address there and you can claim the oat for this event. So do you guys have any closing thoughts?
00:54:23.740 - 00:54:28.640, Speaker C: Yeah, you can actually sign up to check out scroll as well now.
00:54:32.260 - 00:54:39.040, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah, feel free to shout out the URL or you can head over to scroll Twitter as well if you want to shout that out.
00:54:40.100 - 00:54:49.280, Speaker C: Yeah, we've recently opened up registration for our pre alpha testnet, so feel free to head to our Twitter.
00:54:53.060 - 00:55:01.480, Speaker A: Awesome. And, yeah, I think Polygon, Ashworth, you guys just launched the Zk eVM as well. Is that available for people to check out as well?
00:55:02.820 - 00:55:03.236, Speaker F: Probably.
00:55:03.268 - 00:55:20.120, Speaker D: Testnet is something which is going live by the end of this month, so. Yeah, then it would be something which is there. The documentation, on the other hand, is completely available on a public forum. So we can go. We can go ahead to Polygon technology under that. Just go under polygon ZkVm. And you have all the documentations available.
00:55:23.860 - 00:55:34.490, Speaker A: Perfect. So thank you very much. Liam Orest from Scroll Ashwari and a little bit of Hamza from polygon and doge from gnosis chain for being here today and everyone for listening.
00:55:34.830 - 00:55:35.770, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:55:36.830 - 00:55:37.630, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:55:37.670 - 00:55:40.382, Speaker C: Have a great day, everyone. Cheers. Cheers.
00:55:40.446 - 00:55:42.330, Speaker E: Have an amazing day. See you guys.
00:55:43.710 - 00:55:45.130, Speaker A: Thank you. Bye bye.
00:55:45.470 - 00:55:46.350, Speaker B: Thanks, guys. Bye.
