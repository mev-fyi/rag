00:00:00.330 - 00:00:03.406, Speaker A: Hello. What is up, you beautiful people?
00:00:03.588 - 00:01:03.746, Speaker B: Welcome back to the built on Bitcoin podcast, where we're covering everything going on in the stacks ecosystem. And today I have Sungmin am on the podcast. Sungmin is the CEO and co founder of Lucidify, which has created Stackswap. I'm sure you've seen it. And yeah, Stackswap is trying to become the permissionless, decentralized finance application on bitcoin. It's just the application unlocking bitcoin, defi truly via stacks, and they have a whole suite of tools from swapping, pooling, staking, token, launch pad, and that's just the stuff that you see on the front end. Their expertise is really in AI research, and so they're doing a ton of work on the back end, trying new things with forecasting, and just using big.
00:01:03.768 - 00:01:05.394, Speaker A: Data sets to get better information.
00:01:05.512 - 00:01:19.154, Speaker B: So super interesting conversation. Yeah, I trying to think back on what we just talked about. There's so many different rabbit holes we could have gone down and just deep.
00:01:19.202 - 00:01:20.438, Speaker A: Dive for an hour long.
00:01:20.524 - 00:01:31.290, Speaker B: So I think you'll enjoy this one. So let me not talk anymore. Let's just jump right into it with segment om, CEO of lucidify.
00:01:36.910 - 00:01:41.486, Speaker C: Welcome to built on bitcoin today I.
00:01:41.508 - 00:01:44.960, Speaker A: Got Sugman here with me. How you doing, my friend?
00:01:45.650 - 00:01:50.010, Speaker C: Great to be up early and get ready for the interview.
00:01:50.170 - 00:02:07.890, Speaker A: Love to hear it. I'm excited to chat. I see that you guys just released an updated UI for what you guys been working on. You guys launched a little bit ago, but let me just start with kind of the basics and a little bit of your background. What's your expertise and what's your kind of like, wheelhouse?
00:02:08.710 - 00:02:30.090, Speaker C: So I've lowered my PhD language to start the company. We are all AI and data security researchers, and our interest in blockchain and defi in particular over the years has led us here. And we've built multiple Defi projects or different blockchains. And we really enjoyed the journey. And now we are all in on stacks.
00:02:30.670 - 00:02:42.350, Speaker A: Okay, and why, out of all the things you guys could have chosen, there's so much liquidity in Ethereum, you could probably get more money on the front end, maybe. Why choose stacks?
00:02:42.950 - 00:03:36.420, Speaker C: So we're a bit of an idealist, and so we want to bring true, decentralized finance to bitcoin, the largest, oldest and most secure blockchain ecosystem. Right. And we believe stacks was the best solution to make such things possible. Because number one, stacks allows smart contract functionality on bitcoin. Everybody knows that. And number two, this is actually more important, the pox consensus mechanism of stacks inherently allow it to have potential for native bitcoin transaction from stack smart contract calls, which is something that does not exist on any other major blockchain. And this is a significant advantage of stacks over any other existing solution because you can have a native smart contract call and then you can move the bitcoin because it's so tightly coupled with the bitcoin through the mining process.
00:03:36.420 - 00:03:39.860, Speaker C: So when I saw that, like, dude, this is it.
00:03:41.190 - 00:04:19.470, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a huge unlock. And to double click on that because we hear a lot about that, like stacks is connected to bitcoin. Pox is this kind of like unique novel consensus mechanism and we're all trying to find that holy grail where I can just send my BTC from my wallet or even coinbase and it goes straight into the DeFi protocol. And I could use it in all the cool ways that ethereum users get to use it. It doesn't seem like we're there yet, though. We're still kind of using these band aid things since you're so close to it. Where are we at currently and the current functionality versus what's coming down the.
00:04:19.620 - 00:05:03.498, Speaker C: So like all the pieces are there. Almost there, except the native big contraction call from stack smart contract, which is kind of possible in a way. It's there because of pox contract, probably one of the first contracts to be used in the stacks. It distribute bitcoin right, like through the mining process, a stacking process. So I guess what really needs to be done is to integrate bitcoin wallet into the hero wallet. It's kind of possible right now because if you create a stacks wallet, then you could kind of sign into your bitcoin wallet. But just in terms of user interface, it's not that friendly for everyday users yet.
00:05:03.498 - 00:05:14.660, Speaker C: But all the potential is there. They just need to iron things out and get things out the way. Some of the priorities such as hyperchain. And I think it's going to be there hopefully within this year.
00:05:16.150 - 00:05:22.420, Speaker A: I've heard murmurs that stacks 2.1 is going to bring some new functionality. Do you know anything about that?
00:05:22.870 - 00:05:39.558, Speaker C: Yeah, but there's so many things on the priority queue that just keep on getting pumped up back and forth. So we'll have to see, man, until it comes out. But guys are working on the core code like Jude and then they're geniuses. So I'm sure we'll see something awesome when it's out.
00:05:39.724 - 00:06:03.700, Speaker A: Yeah, I like to pop into the blockchain weekly meeting and I have no idea what they're saying, but I just kind of sit in the background and just feel smart and try and pick up a couple of keywords. It's cool to see that. And they're working on it. Well, let's then jump into what you guys are working on. So give us the broad. You've kind of touched that a little bit. But what is stackswap? What are you building?
00:06:04.470 - 00:07:21.260, Speaker C: Our value, and our kind of like a mission statement, is that we want to deliver an easy approach to fully fledged decentralized finance into bitcoin via stacks. And one of the most important keyword that we focus on, I think, is permissionless. We believe the word decentralized should mean permissionless, right? Like, if you ask someone for permission to do things, it's a centralized project, not a defi. So what does it mean by permissionless? I think it means you could do what you want without the approval of a centralized operating party. So for in context of an exchange and token generation launchpad like ours, this means one can issue and list, publish their own coin on blockchain without anyone's approval, including us. This is crucial, I think, especially for smaller projects, because they're generally not well funded or like some nonprofit projects too, and need to move forward as soon as possible. Right? Everybody is in competition, and we have no time nowadays, but if you need to ask permission from an exchange to list and publish coin on the blockchain, it inevitably creates a lot of costs, both in terms of time and money.
00:07:21.260 - 00:08:12.806, Speaker C: So we want to bring decentralized finance to the masses, like those who are even not well equipped with tech. I want to let them be able to participate right away, as soon as possible. And as I mentioned earlier, the core team members were researchers, so we have the spirit to invent new tech, try to make a social impact with it. And when you think about it, the really ability to create their own money and allowing anyone to exchange them against others, it just was only possible only for the par for few until very recently. And that's what we like to bring, to bring more freedom for the people to just do what they want. And in a way, this, I believe, is like a major difference between us and others in a sex ecosystem. We have this cyberpunk culture to the core.
00:08:12.806 - 00:08:45.566, Speaker C: I mean, how cool is it that we could actually do so many things that were only possible in fictions lately? And I believe with a lot of effort, I'm sure we could endow power to the masses and just give them the choices to participate in the wide range of economies that they want. So, yeah, Stacksob is we have this exchange mechanism right now, and I think it's vital to any economy. And, yeah, we want to keep it open for more people, easy access and all.
00:08:45.688 - 00:09:38.078, Speaker A: Okay, you touched on, like five things I found fascinating. So I'm trying to pick what thread to pull, but let's start with the point you just ended on, which is the swapping mechanism. The way that I interpret that is the reason it's so powerful is because the ability to enter and exit a token is like being able to enter and exit a country or a community. It's like free flowing trade in all aspects. And so if I don't believe in what that token is doing, because some fundamental change, I can all leave and I'm not stuck and have to vest or anything, I can just freely move to that next thing. What is the power? What does that unlock? To be able to have this free open access and swapping across all these tokens that you guys are offering, in.
00:09:38.104 - 00:10:25.274, Speaker C: Order for you to be able to jump from one economy to another, there has to be a lot of options, right? And right now, stacks being a bit. Now it's being more mature. Until recently, it was in nascent stage of a defi, at least. So we need to provide some kind of like an easy mechanism, people to just enter this stacks bitcoin defi ecosystem. And not everybody could develop in clarity, right. And have time to learn it and write code and publish it while they prepare for their business or nonprofit organization matters. One of the issue that we ran into, like all the blockchain projects that we tried, and the other blockchain, there's so much time and bit of money that it takes to even get, like simple audits.
00:10:25.274 - 00:11:01.200, Speaker C: And without this audit paper, you can't move forward to do anything. So we allow people to have these free pre audited token contracts they could just use, and that will lower the barrier of entry to create this different economy. Now then, of course, you could list right away and swap among each other. And, yeah, now that allows this free flow plus a network effect. And that's what we try to aim for both of them together.
00:11:01.730 - 00:11:19.720, Speaker A: It sounds like it's almost like, in its perfect conception, it's like the world's best foreign exchange, where you can come in with, let's say, the best form of money, like BTC, and you bring it in and then you can fork it to any other currency in the world that you want to and go down that.
00:11:20.650 - 00:11:21.810, Speaker C: Yep, yep.
00:11:21.970 - 00:12:11.574, Speaker A: Very interesting. The other thing you. There's, I think we're seeing it right now with decentralization, with sanctions when it comes to what's going on in Ukraine and Russia. And we're seeing not only is the old financial systems kind of like beholden to some of those rules, but the bigger exchanges that we thought are more above that in a sense, and more to crypto ethos also have to play by those rules or suffer even worse consequences. How does that come into play where there's this give and take between decentralization and censoring, things that collectively we deem as negative? How do you guys find that balance? How do you protect yourself from always being decentralized and censorship resistant so you.
00:12:11.612 - 00:13:06.562, Speaker C: Can'T be completely decentralized and anonymous? Maybe it's possible to a certain degree, but nowadays, unless you don't use your phone anymore, your information is out there and it's very difficult to hide it completely and some degree of centralization. I don't think it's possible to avoid it, at least for now. But what we want to aim for is eventually something that I don't really want to fight the current regulations. I don't think it's good for the community as a whole. You can fight it, but it won't allow you to grow as much. We need to have more people in the community. So I want to find a way to be okay with the regulation, but at the same time provide as much sensor resistance as possible that needs decentralization.
00:13:06.562 - 00:14:19.818, Speaker C: Right. So I think the way the DeFi project has been running is pretty brilliant. You have this core code that does exchange functionality on a blockchain. So it's like all the back end is in the blockchain, nobody can touch it, it's already published, and at the same time you service it through a front end and using that smart contracts that you deployed so you can have some kind of a centralized operation. But if you ever get some kind of sanction, or if you cannot allow people to join through your front end that you operate centrally, they could still access it through blockchain, although it needs a bit of learning and coding probably, but it has an inherent censorship resistance to the financial market. One thing that fascinated me into DeFi when unisoft first started was I was trading in a centralized exchange using AI algorithm time to time. And it happens sometimes you can get a connection to the exchange whenever there's this large price fluctuation.
00:14:19.818 - 00:14:51.130, Speaker C: Somehow mysteriously the server gets shut down and your position gets liquidated sometimes. And I got so sick of it. Is there any way that I could get to a market that cannot stop me from getting access to it? And, well, there was like unisoft when I saw, wow, this is the future. So I want to bring that into bitcoin. But then it took a while to find the means to do that. And I think we're getting close. I'm very excited.
00:14:52.430 - 00:15:34.406, Speaker A: It's so powerful. I don't fully grasp it until you explained it like that, where it's like, we all know that the blockchain is this distributed ledger and so the copies of it are running all over the world. And if you know how to connect with the blockchain, you can pull data as you see fit and interact with it, manipulate it, or send transactions, again to this permissionless, like, anybody can mine. Anybody can send transactions and update the state. It seems like that one thing that we're kind of missing is that how do we fully decentralize the harder things like DNS or techno front end, because then they literally can't stop what's going on. Every piece of it is there.
00:15:34.508 - 00:15:52.620, Speaker C: And you probably need to run community run network. Everybody run their own wifi hotspot so that people can connect the mesh network, bring it to the satellite. There'll be the volunteers. All that needs to be done. I want to be able to support it. Once we have enough money, we might.
00:15:53.550 - 00:15:58.830, Speaker A: We want to see that. Yeah, we're going to create our own comcast and all these different isps.
00:15:59.490 - 00:16:04.720, Speaker C: Anyone could just get an access to Internet, thus blockchain right away.
00:16:05.330 - 00:16:36.860, Speaker A: That's powerful. Okay, I'm going to come back to some of the more specific stack swap stuff. I want to touch on some of the stuff that you worked on when it comes to AI. And I heard in a previous interview, I think it was with Gina, you talked about how you guys had an expertise in black swan events. And my only connection with that is really reading, trying to read Nassim Taleb's book, Black Swan, and it's a heady book. I don't fully grasp it. What is a black swan event and how do you study those things?
00:16:37.230 - 00:17:46.770, Speaker C: So black Swan event is something that is very improbable, but nonetheless does happen. This is especially important for risk mitigation in finance because you just need to basically predict things you cannot predict, but you have to predict it or you get damaged from it. Right? And it's always been fascinating to me because there's like, pattern recognition, there's some kind of like a set rules of like, you try to fit a data into some kind of equation, maybe complex or simple, maybe neural network, you try to fit it in. So non flex one, event detection or forecast, it's kind of like already been laid out. There's somewhat of an optimality. Depending on some kind of computation that you do, you could kind of roughly get some idea of what's going to happen in the future if assuming the data pattern is consistent. But what if it's not? That's what Blackfon event is about, right? So whatever was happening all the time and all of a sudden it doesn't.
00:17:46.770 - 00:18:10.566, Speaker C: And that, I think, is like something human beings can't do, just being able to recognize the pattern and see what's going to happen next. We can, we see what happens, like seasons and all that. We can kind of do it. But in terms of things like flex one event, that's something we can do. I see. This is like the next level of AI. You can't do it with a traditional algorithm.
00:18:10.566 - 00:18:42.930, Speaker C: You need to come up with something new. Maybe it's impossible to have a general solution for it, although we haven't solved it yet, of course. But we're getting some breakthroughs starting a couple of years ago, actually. And if you got this during our student years, we could have been like world famous researchers by now. We just started working after we started business. And yeah, it was a bit surprising. Let me share a bit of a secret.
00:18:42.930 - 00:19:35.554, Speaker C: When we first started out, we try to feed in all the data you can, like Twitter feed, news, you name it, YouTube, like whatever, and just shove it in and have a gigantic neural network, turn stuff out and have a complex model work things out. And it ended up being a noise and it came to me one day. So if you have a child, and if you teach this child anything indiscriminately, it doesn't make this child smart, right? So you have to teach only smart stuff. So this concept of data evaluation stepped in. So depending on the data, some data is worth more than another. So we make sure the AI doesn't learn some of the stuff. Now, it started working a little bit, and we end up looking at only the market data that actually performs much better.
00:19:35.554 - 00:20:04.110, Speaker C: So I'm sure there are things we can detect from Twitter feed and stuff you can get from the Internet, from other sources, but we just got rid of that because it's very difficult to do analysis. You can kind of tweak the performance, but it's difficult to see why it did such. So we can't improve it easily. So if you only look at the market data, then it's one dimensional. It's much easier. Even if you include volume. It's not that high dimensional.
00:20:04.110 - 00:20:42.854, Speaker C: It's just number. It makes it much more manageable to analyze. And that actually helped us in the long run. We're still tweaking and I think I'm going to look into it for the rest of my life until I'm like 90 years old, because it might not ever be solved, but by itself, it's fascinating subject and it has very important usage. And you could protect people from getting burned if you can do that among like ten blacks fund event. If you could take only one, even that will be good enough. Right? So it has clear use cases and it's fascinating.
00:20:42.854 - 00:20:45.898, Speaker C: So, yeah, very interesting.
00:20:45.984 - 00:21:29.510, Speaker A: Yeah. I remember when I read Taleb's book, he talks about the turkey and thanksgiving is like the clear example where the turkey gets fed every day by the farmer, and he thinks the farmer is his friend and there's no problems. Like every day at sunrise, he comes and he shows up and he makes me fat. And it's great. It's a great relationship until that last day where he meets his demise. And so just to understand my thinking a little bit, it sounds like the way that this works is you don't really know what variables you can exactly plug in, but you just kind of feed it data and start to. Maybe the machine would find patterns of other animals that get fed on a consistent scale, sometimes have a random demise.
00:21:29.510 - 00:21:31.690, Speaker A: Is that kind of how it pattern matches?
00:21:32.190 - 00:22:13.240, Speaker C: Well, it's slightly different. So what we try to focus is we try to understand what normal is as detailed as possible, because you can't know what you don't know. And you have to know what you don't know in order to predict blackfone events perfectly. Right. This information asymmetry is what do not allow us to predict it. Whatever stuff that happens that looks weird, let's say like, oh, he was feeding me every day saying same stuff, and all of a sudden he was too happy feeding me in the morning, like, oh, maybe something's going on.
00:22:15.930 - 00:22:16.680, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:17.210 - 00:22:18.614, Speaker C: That kind of like stuff we use.
00:22:18.652 - 00:22:38.110, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Okay. And then you put some notes in here, and I'm really curious about this. So you said you're talking about the convergence of AI and blockchain and how that can be an important milestone for the future of these things. What's the landscape of that? How do these things intersect?
00:22:41.650 - 00:23:26.330, Speaker C: Nothing much had been going on, I think nothing tangible, because although it's fascinating, the culture is slightly different. And recently there have been some work here and there trying to run some artificial neural network model on some kind of distributed system that could be like a blockchain. There are some projects that were doing it, some chinese projects like two, three years ago. And then after that nothing much went on. And what I and rest of my team were interested in are not infrastructure stuff. Also is a bit of an importance. But what we're more interested in is how to bring in governance.
00:23:26.330 - 00:24:03.034, Speaker C: I mean, how to automate the governance of the blockchain ecosystem with AI as much as possible. Because when you think about it until recently, right, the trust could not be automated. I see blockchain as something that automated trust. Because how do I trust that you own x amount of bitcoin? Somebody had to prove that before. Now nobody needs to prove it's automated. Then what's the next step? Plato has been criticizing democracy from the republic like 2400 years ago. It's been a while, right? But that is the best system we have.
00:24:03.034 - 00:24:43.222, Speaker C: And maybe this is about time that we could try to automate some of the governance with the new technology that we have. I mean, AI needs to develop a lot more, and blockchain does need to develop because competition over it won't make it possible yet. But if it could. Blockchain ecosystem, you just mentioned it earlier, it's like a whole new economy. And if you enter a token ecosystem, it's like a new country, right? And it's a microcosm of the world. It's very small and small amount of people and small parameters. Maybe some of these optimal actions might be feasible for very small ecosystem and not much parameters, decision parameters to mess with.
00:24:43.222 - 00:25:11.440, Speaker C: So this is somewhere we could start out like experimenting and actually have community members benefited from this automation of governance. And I really think that should be the direction both AI and blockchain ecosystem needs to head towards. And I really believe the killer use case of AI could be governance. We don't want all this kind of stuff, but at least some part of it we can, right?
00:25:13.010 - 00:25:49.514, Speaker A: That was my first thought, and I think that's everyone's first danger is they go straight to the exact worst case, which is like we have these cyborg overlords that they just kind of act like humans and they control us. But I think we're already seeing it. When I first used a Tesla and I had it drive for me, I was like, oh wow, this is amazing. Like the future is already here. It's in these beautiful cars that we're seeing pass by every day. And my regular friends that I talk to, if they haven't interacted with it, they're like, I would never trust that thing. There's no way it's going to be better than a human.
00:25:49.514 - 00:25:52.826, Speaker A: There's no chance. And I'm like, until you drive it.
00:25:53.008 - 00:25:55.934, Speaker C: Once you have that experience, it's like totally different, right?
00:25:55.972 - 00:26:16.514, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. Perfect lane. Keeping it keeps the car in front of me. It's aware of everything around me. It doesn't get tired. And we have a history of records, so they could look at the data and go, the chance of an autopilot Tesla getting in a crash is x percent lower than the average human. Let's go with that.
00:26:16.514 - 00:26:45.600, Speaker A: And give you maybe a discount on your insurance or something. Because we trust the system more than that. I think you're right. It starts in these small areas that are like, now that I've driven a Tesla, I hate driving. It's such a waste of time. Can I just hit that button and be on my phone? Like, I got a book to read? Let me just let the car do its thing. It's going to start like that with small use cases like driving or small decision making efforts, and we'll just lever up over time.
00:26:46.130 - 00:27:17.446, Speaker C: One of the stuff that we can automate is like token release schedule for the community. Like how much to allocate a certain pool and how much to release the community. What's the optimal number? It's basically like input and output control theory problem. And this is something the AI can do very well, like numbers and factors to consider. We just want to try our best to make sure sex app becomes popularized. Then there'll be more participants in the ecosystem. They're going to try all these AI stuff.
00:27:17.446 - 00:27:18.902, Speaker C: It could be super cool.
00:27:19.036 - 00:27:39.386, Speaker A: Got it. That's very cool. And that's one of those things where it's almost in the background, like, they won't know what's going on. They just know that for some reason, stackswap works really well and their yields are better, whatever it is. But it's all that back end genius that's going on from the pattern matching and the algorithms.
00:27:39.578 - 00:27:42.298, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the vision.
00:27:42.474 - 00:27:48.834, Speaker A: That's very interesting. So that stuff that you're not working on right now, you guys have more priorities in front of that stuff?
00:27:48.952 - 00:28:23.114, Speaker C: Yeah, we are working on it in parallel. Okay, but we have to wait, like I said, we have to wait until some of the stuff from foundation is in place, like hyperchain and many other things. Once it's there, then it'll be ready to go, because without it we can model it, but dynamic between the blockchain and the centralized server and see how things are going with the numbers. It's a bit tricky. It has to be there, the real model has to be there in order for us to fine tune it. So we have to wait for a little bit until everything's ready. Got it.
00:28:23.152 - 00:28:32.862, Speaker A: Okay, cool. I'm realizing, man, we're just riffing so well right here. We're already at a half hour, so I want to cover as much as I can in maybe these next 15 or so.
00:28:32.996 - 00:28:33.680, Speaker C: Okay.
00:28:34.690 - 00:28:43.890, Speaker A: And we haven't even really discovered or talked about all the things that you guys offer. So we have discussed swapping. What's some of the other stuff that you guys offer with stackswap?
00:28:44.310 - 00:29:37.510, Speaker C: Well, like the standard defi stuff like pulling, which means people put up their lp token, lock it for x amount of time and get rewarded stacks up token staking, which is you lock up stacks up token and get stacks up token. It's kind of like a loan almost. You're lending it out for a fixed amount of time. You can kind of consider as that and allow people to provide people some kind of economic incentive to grow the ecosystem, which was a standard model for the past couple of years. And we just started with that. And what I really wanted to make it widely available is token launchpad. Like I said earlier, it will allow people to have pre audited token contract, that they could just spin it off and list and do all that at one blockchain transaction.
00:29:37.510 - 00:30:13.806, Speaker C: And it was very important because stacks blockchain, the time is matched one to one to a bitcoin block time. So it wasn't as fast. So being able to finish everything in one transaction was a huge time saver. But at the same time, right now there are more clarity, developers and more documentation. But even like a year ago, the community was much smaller and less documentation. So the learning curve was a lot steeper than it is right now. So even if you want to participate in stack's Defi ecosystem, you couldn't.
00:30:13.806 - 00:31:10.258, Speaker C: But now you can just come in and just do know. We're basically like all developers and researchers, so we thought it was very super simple and easy, but it was still too user, not user friendly, our previous UI. So we put a major UI update recently to make it more friendly and more informative and there'll be more to come. So our priority is to kind of like popularize this launchpad and maybe market it properly so people could use it, use it well, and maybe some of the information about how to use it just bit not clearly delivered to the community. So maybe you need to be more clear about that. There's basically no fee, I mean like a small fee structure to later on to connect it to the participants. We just wired it in it.
00:31:10.258 - 00:31:52.762, Speaker C: But the minimum amount of token that you need to own is yours. You can always sell it anytime you want. So it's not like you pay listing fees. And there is AI NFT, which is a bit sidetracked in a way, if you see it on the top of it. But before we get to that, let's talk about SFX synthetic bitcoin. So why another weird bitcoin when there is bitcoin? I see bitcoin as much more stable storage of wealth than fiat currencies. It's just my personal belief and also the belief of many team members in the sexom.
00:31:52.762 - 00:32:42.800, Speaker C: So one of the problem of bitcoin always being criticized is the scarcity, right? There's only so much bitcoin, you won't be able to function as well as a currency. Well, then why don't we just create something that's like asset backed and tracks the price of a bitcoin, like know, but instead of tracking US dollar, tracking bitcoin price. So we solve this scarcity issue by doing that. And we want to experiment with the mechanism to convert any token asset into more stable bitcoin asset. So we want to try to see how it works with our own tokens first. Then maybe somewhere down the road we can offer it to anybody who issued their token. They want to have more stable asset backed bitcoin or whatever other asset they want to issue.
00:32:42.800 - 00:33:17.866, Speaker C: So yeah, we want to bring more variety and freedom into the ecosystem, like more building blocks people can play with. So that was the main thing. And we have some plans to make user adoption much more than right now. Only few people are using it, one of which was like this AI NFT market. We just want you to try something to experiment with the new type of NFT. So imagine you have a painting with gold. Even if nobody buys your painting, you can always extract that gold and sell it, right, and have some money out of it.
00:33:17.866 - 00:33:56.310, Speaker C: Which means the AI NFTs that we issue right now, it has this SFX BTC embedded in it. Every time there's transaction, a little bit is stored more and more inside of an NFT. Once you burn it, then you can get the money back. So it inherently allows the lower bound of the worth of this particular NFT as a collateral. So this allows another NFT based lending ecosystem too, and not just with our token. Maybe they could try with some other people's token, could create launch pad with it. So this is a direction we're thinking.
00:33:56.310 - 00:34:28.578, Speaker C: So we want to create some kind of like a playground for everybody or some kind of like a thought experiment factory that could just turn things out, just toss in their idea. It'll pop out. I want people to use it more. There probably will be a lot of amazing use cases of a defi and just we haven't thought of. And we just want to provide all these tools so people could use it and make it even better than it is right now. Very cool.
00:34:28.664 - 00:34:52.042, Speaker A: Yeah, that's powerful. I think we see that with like the pox mechanism is powerful and it allows you to lock up your stacks to get your bitcoin. And then the pox lite we've seen the biggest use case is obviously citicoins. And people must connect pox lite to citicoins like they're synonymous. But it's just utilizing that thing. Like pox Lite could be used for all kinds of mechanisms, a huge design.
00:34:52.096 - 00:35:23.810, Speaker C: Space, any community token, you can do that. You could issue audited pox lite token from Stacksoft right now too. You can do it, probably. But a lot of people who are not well versed with clarity. It's pretty scary in all that, the VRF and how are you going to make it? And you need user interface to allow people to stake and stack and mine and all. And we could ship all that at once and you could just use it, do whatever you want with it.
00:35:23.960 - 00:35:50.780, Speaker A: That's so necessary. I love that. That's very cool. People need to play with that. Okay, I want to switch gears a little bit because you guys were in the first cohort of stacks accelerator, which was super cool to watch you guys kind of like go from the beginning and then demo day and now you're live and you've had v one and you have v two now, which is like a whole redesign. It's a light years ahead of the last design. It looks so good.
00:35:50.780 - 00:35:59.120, Speaker A: How was the accelerator and how is it being in the cohort one up until when you started to search for funding? How was that process?
00:36:01.010 - 00:36:39.782, Speaker C: Right before the cohort one, we were in other accelerator program, like SOS fees. China accelerator batch 19th, I think. So we did get some basics down, but what we learned the most, of course, always helpful to learn things over and over again that are important. What was most helpful was to get this tip on how to approach investors and interact with them a lot. So I feel like I could talk to any investor right now, and within 10 seconds I know whether they're going to invest or not. I get it. Sometimes you match, sometimes you don't.
00:36:39.782 - 00:37:19.098, Speaker C: And there are ways to approach the investors, too. Usually the investors, like the vcs, are divided into three categories. The guys who believe in more, team more, or product more, or market more. I mean, people care about all three, but there's always this difference between these three. So you look through their articles, they publish somewhere that you know that, okay, this guy's product based. So I emphasize on product stuff and all that through the process, I got so familiar with it. So we raised a little more than $4 million in a couple of months real quick.
00:37:19.098 - 00:37:53.940, Speaker C: And, yeah, it was awesome, because as an entrepreneur, you need to constantly raise money forever, always. And getting that tip to start out was very important, and I think it was very helpful. And amongst so many other help we got from stacks accelerator, I think this was the best help for us. And after we got out of it, there's constant intro they made for us to the new investors. And, yeah, basically we're like a big family getting help with each other. So it's great.
00:37:58.150 - 00:38:11.340, Speaker A: How do I word this? So you're getting courted by investors. Are you also judging? Who is this person I'm investing from? Do I want them on my. It's a two way, of course. So how was that process?
00:38:13.390 - 00:39:13.770, Speaker C: I try to avoid the people who are more into like a hit and run type of business, which is not a problem, and there's nothing wrong with it, just different investment style. So I tried to get some hands on investors who invest in their project, and they want to get involved in pitching the idea and try to have the journey together. I mean, we're all here to make money, but might as well have fun with it, right? Why we do this? And the guys I'm with, they only care about money, which is important. But if they only care about money, it's not as fun. If they like the journey and just have this experience together, I think that's what's worth it. So when I talk to a big vc firm, we try to find out their culture. Like when they invest or they try to help or what are they trying to do with their portfolio companies? That's the basic thing that we try to make decision upon.
00:39:13.770 - 00:39:19.742, Speaker C: Are they more hands on, more long term investors? Got it.
00:39:19.796 - 00:39:44.198, Speaker A: Okay, well, last question I have, and I try to end these on these kind of, like, a more off in the weeds high note. So, if we're looking at stack swap in five years, which I know is crazy because crypto moves so fast, so much can change all this. But what's a perfect home run look like where you guys have executed everything's gone perfectly. In five years from now, we want.
00:39:44.204 - 00:39:52.860, Speaker C: To be the place for all bitcoin defi. You come in and do anything. Bitcoin defi. This is where you come. I mean, that'll be the perfect scenario. Beautiful.
00:39:53.310 - 00:40:01.340, Speaker A: Okay. I love it. I love it. It's short, concise, and just like, that's what we're working towards. We're the place. We're it. I love it.
00:40:01.340 - 00:40:09.150, Speaker A: Well, man, this has been a great conversation segment. Any closing thoughts that you want to kind of like anything I missed or anything you want to leave for the audience?
00:40:10.850 - 00:40:33.010, Speaker C: Well, we're not very proficient at marketing ourselves, at least not yet, which we are trying very hard to improve. But there are just plenty of things you can take advantage of from stackswap. So please try things out and give us feedbacks, and we'll deliver what you need. And even more, probably. So, yeah, just feedbacks. Try things out, give it a shot.
00:40:33.090 - 00:40:38.342, Speaker A: And what's the best way? If they play with it and they want to give some feedback directly, where's the best place to keep in touch?
00:40:38.396 - 00:40:46.650, Speaker C: Discord. Yeah, come to our discord. And even if you don't respond right away, we'll get to it. We all get to every single problem.
00:40:46.720 - 00:40:53.854, Speaker A: So we will eventually, just so people hear it clearly. What's the website to get access to the app?
00:40:53.972 - 00:41:00.990, Speaker C: It's ww. Stexwap.org. Perfect. Yep.
00:41:01.410 - 00:41:16.542, Speaker A: Beautiful. Sungman, man, I mean, I feel like there's so many more things when it comes to AI or pooling and forecasting. We could talk for hours. Maybe we'll do a round two in the future when you guys have been totally.
00:41:16.686 - 00:41:38.758, Speaker C: Do this again. Whenever we launch stuff out and. Yeah, anytime. Welcome to built on bitcoin. I know that things don't always go your way, but I'll be right here waiting, waiting now I've been trying to.
00:41:38.764 - 00:41:39.766, Speaker A: Figure out a way to make it.
00:41:39.788 - 00:41:42.940, Speaker C: Out make it out sound think about everything gonna run.
