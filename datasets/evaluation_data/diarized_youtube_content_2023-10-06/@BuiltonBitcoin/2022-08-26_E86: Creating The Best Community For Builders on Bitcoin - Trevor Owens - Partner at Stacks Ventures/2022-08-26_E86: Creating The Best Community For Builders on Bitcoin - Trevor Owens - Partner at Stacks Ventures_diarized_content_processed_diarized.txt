00:00:00.490 - 00:00:42.426, Speaker A: What is up, you beautiful people? Welcome back to the built on Bitcoin podcast, where we cover everything going on in the bitcoin ecosystem. This is your home for bitcoin innovation. So we're talking to the builders, the founders, the movers and shakers that are trying to unleash bitcoin all of its facets. I'm your humble host, Jacob Brown, but you'll see me around as Jake blockchain. And today I have a fantastic conversation with Trevor Owens. Trevor is the managing partner at Stacks Ventures, which, as the name sounds, is a venture arm inside the stacks ecosystem that funds stack startups. And we cover a ton.
00:00:42.426 - 00:01:13.506, Speaker A: In this conversation we talk about stacks, the bitcoin thesis. We talk about his background, what he did before he was an investor. He has a great response. For my typical last question of the podcast of if you couldn't fail, you'd just been executing perfectly. What does five years from now look like? And he gave us his ultimate dream goal and what his kind of life's mission is, which I thought was a fantastic response. The answer he gave. So we cover a ton.
00:01:13.506 - 00:01:32.666, Speaker A: The stacks token stuff has been going on. Bitcoin Maxi is a little bit here and there. So yeah, you don't want to miss this one. Highly, highly recommend. Especially if you're a builder and you're interested in trying to get a leg up and some actionable insight. This one's for you. So let's jump in.
00:01:32.666 - 00:01:35.930, Speaker A: But first, real quick, a word from our sponsor.
00:01:36.670 - 00:02:17.698, Speaker B: We all know bitcoin is for the innovators, the revolutionaries, and the builders looking to build a better world for themselves and for the next generation. We also know the saying, the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is right now. The same thing applies to building on bitcoin. If you want to come build with the most active developer community, building new use cases for bitcoin, then it's time you make the leap to learning clarity. Clarity is the stack's smart contract programming layer, which enables us to work on defi smart contracts and so much more, all built with the safety and security that comes with bitcoin. Start today by going to start stacks.org
00:02:17.698 - 00:02:40.720, Speaker B: start stacks.org has a five step journey that will take you from complete stacks novice to teaching you clarity, all the way to finding a job with a web three stack startup. Don't wait another month, year or decade waiting to get involved in the bitcoin ecosystem. Start building on bitcoin today. Go to start stacks.org to start learning and building today.
00:02:41.170 - 00:03:04.310, Speaker A: All right, thank you to the Stacks foundation. Now, without further ado, cue the sexy Segway music. Welcome to built on bitcoin, Trevor. How you doing today, my man?
00:03:04.460 - 00:03:06.342, Speaker C: Good man. How about you?
00:03:06.476 - 00:03:30.430, Speaker A: I am a little sleepy, but super excited to have you on. Yeah, there's a ton to talk about. You're a figure in the stack space, so yeah, I'm not even sure where to dance around at first, but maybe for people that aren't aware of Trevor, what's a little bit of your background?
00:03:31.410 - 00:04:14.358, Speaker C: Yes, I'm the managing partner of Stacks Ventures. My background is as an entrepreneur advisor to startup companies, as a developer as well. So I got started about 15 years ago building companies. Since I was in university, my first business was actually importing scooters from China to the US. If you kind of Google my scooter story, it was actually a failure. That led to my next venture, which was going around the world teaching people about lean startup, which is about how to validate your startup ideas before you build them and invest too much time and money in them. And so I met up with the author of the Lean Startup, Eric Reese.
00:04:14.358 - 00:05:02.974, Speaker C: Before he wrote the book, he was sort of like a mentor to me. I learned a lot from him, as well as from many other people in the lean startup community, like Brent Cooper, who we've actually brought into the accelerator about this customer development process. And I created one of the largest grassroots organized startup training camps called Lean Startup machine that we did in something like 150 cities around the world. And we created a bunch of tools. I worked with gracing, who's the creator of Crash punk, she's my co founder. And she did all the branding for lean starter machine and ran a lot of the workshops. And we consulted with some of the largest Fortune 500 companies in the world, like GE, American Express, you name it.
00:05:02.974 - 00:05:42.826, Speaker C: Microsoft. If there's a Fortune 500 company doing like innovation or tech, they've probably been through my training camp. And I also went over to China and started teaching innovation to Huawei and Tencent, which was a very interesting experience. And along the way, I advised hundreds of founders around the world. One of the founders that I worked more closely with was the founders of stacks. So Ryan Shea and Maneib Ali, when they were getting off the ground originally, they went through multiple iterations. I met them when they were literally just first getting started.
00:05:42.826 - 00:06:05.140, Speaker C: I had known Ryan for a while and he introduced me to Maneb. And the beginning, they were even talking about doing medical health records. And they got into when bitcoin started getting popular in 2012. They went all in on it. They were the reason I first bought bitcoin. I had over 100 bitcoin at one point. Sold it all when it was going down.
00:06:05.140 - 00:06:42.240, Speaker C: Over the years, I was just very impressed by everything they were doing. I was continuing to basically build software and launch products in the startup space. So helping entrepreneurs start startups. Launched about five different products. Trying to help entrepreneurs use a lean startup method to launch their businesses. Various successes, levels of success. Nothing that was a home run or slam dunk or sort of blockbuster product.
00:06:42.240 - 00:07:18.266, Speaker C: And I built a lot of the products myself, full stack, mainly in Ruby on rails. But I also love elixir. Phoenix is a program for me. I really like respect to ninja alerts, which is also in addition to Sachs ventures. I also run ninja alerts, which is an NFT alerts tool that allows you to follow wallets on ethereum and get alerts when people are buying, minting, or selling different nfTs. We built that in node and react. So I'm pretty well versed in the technology side.
00:07:18.266 - 00:07:55.410, Speaker C: And yeah, I approached sort of the team at stacks when they first launched stacks 2.0. I still had my advisor token allocation. I haven't sold a single one of those. In fact, my stacks stake is much higher than my original advisor share now because I flipped a ton of NFTs on Ethereum and then reinvested a lot of that back into stacks. And so I approached them when they launched stacks 2.0, and I was actually building accelerator management software. And they were like, oh, we need someone to run our accelerator.
00:07:55.410 - 00:08:30.394, Speaker C: We don't need the software, but can you just run the accelerator for us? And so that's how we got started. Put together a great team, of which, Jake, you're part of. Kyle, my partner. We have Andrea Francisco and now Nikita on the team. And we've invested in 45 companies in the stacks ecosystem. I've made some investments myself outside of stacks, mainly in companies run by friends of mine or things that are strategic for what I'm doing in the NFT space. And I'm just super, of course, stacks maxi and passionate about stacks and bitcoin.
00:08:30.394 - 00:08:43.682, Speaker C: And I see value in everything that's being built in web three. And that was a big shift for me. In a year ago, I would say I went from being a complete skeptic to a complete believer in a very short time.
00:08:43.816 - 00:09:05.820, Speaker A: When you started that, you mentioned the scooter story, which there's an interesting video you can watch on that one, and it kind of shows some of the lean startup methodology about validating your ideas, mvps, this kind of thing. But when you think about entrepreneurship, actually maybe to lead into this. Were you entrepreneurial as a kid?
00:09:07.790 - 00:09:27.374, Speaker C: Not really. I think as a kid, I was mainly, like, a nerd. I mean, I did coding when I was a kid. I think in high school, I took, like, four years of coding. I was lucky that actually my school even had it. It's kind of rare looking back at. I mean, may it's more popular today, but not many schools even have offered programming courses.
00:09:27.374 - 00:09:58.954, Speaker C: I was really good at that. I was really good at computers, but mainly a gamer, I think. Before high school, like middle school, I started my own guild, my own guild on diablo two. That's the most entrepreneurial thing I did. But it really came down to when I was in high school, and I wasn't even that really ambitious of a kid, to be honest, because I was kind of ambitious. But what really motivated me, I was ambitious in athletics. So I was captain of the wrestling team in high school.
00:09:58.954 - 00:10:33.106, Speaker C: I was ranked number one my senior year. I ended up getting injured, and that was a big turning point for me because it was kind of a point of suffering. I lost my identity. My girlfriend broke up with me at the time, my first girlfriend, and that sort of made me really ambitious. And I happened to be a part of this high school program called Future Business Leaders of America. I don't know if it's still around today, but basically. And I went to high school in New Hampshire.
00:10:33.106 - 00:11:00.746, Speaker C: And so what I did was every summer I would compete in a programming competition, and I basically won. So I won the state in this future business of America. They had, like, a c plus plus bring competition, and I competed in the c plus plus one. And I think I got second. I can't remember. And then there was a web design competition. I won first in that, or maybe I got second, the visual basic.
00:11:00.746 - 00:11:55.018, Speaker C: I think I won, like, second and first twice or something like that. And then they would pay for me to go to this national conference, and that was a lot of fun. And there'd be, like, motivational speakers there who would talk about how to start your own business and sort of like Tony Robbins type stuff. And that sort of really got me interested in starting businesses. And then I started my first web design company in high school, and then leading into university, started the scooter company. I was going to go to Wall street because I went to NYU Stern for undergrad and then decided that I didn't want to do that. And then got into, actually had this fantastic professor named Larry Lenihan, who is a venture capitalist in New York city at NYU, he had invested in Pinterest and second market, which was what Barry Silbert, the founder of DCG, his previous, like, it was this amazing course.
00:11:55.018 - 00:12:23.578, Speaker C: A friend of mine, I almost didn't sign up for it. A friend of mine, basically, because I was studying Chinese, and I met this kid at the, when I transferred to NYU. You have to take a placement test to figure out what level your chinese is. So I met this kid, Mel, who became a good friend, and I was like, what course are you taking? He's like, I'm taking this entrepreneurship course. This professor looks like Gordon Gecko. He has, like, a three piece suit. And so this is Larry Lenihan, if anybody knows him.
00:12:23.578 - 00:12:50.580, Speaker C: Take a laugh. But in that class, basically, the founder of Chainlink was my project partner. So Sergey Nazarov took the court class with him. Actually, Mimo and Sergey started a company in Larry's class, and then I think it was the next year, Kyle Samani, who founded multi chain Capital. It was a multi coin capital. Anyway, he's like, one of the biggest crypto vcs right now. Big Solana guy.
00:12:50.580 - 00:13:24.498, Speaker C: He was in the next class. So it's kind of like, I don't know what my point is, but just kind of telling my story. Been through an interesting journey here. And actually, it was Larry who really was the reason why I didn't go to Wall street, because he always said, the older you get, the harder it becomes to start a business. You get a mortgage, you get kids, you have more risk. The best time to start a business is even when you're younger, you don't know anything. You're inexperienced.
00:13:24.498 - 00:14:02.102, Speaker C: It's actually much better to start a business then than trying to go to the corporate world and then start a business later, because you're going to have more risk. And so he was always like, if you have an idea, you should start now. And if you're in your fail, that's actually fine. It's much better to fail in your. Might suck, but at least in your 30s, you'll know exactly what to do. And actually, that's kind of exactly where I'm at now in my life, because I had all these different, launched so many different products, and some of them were pretty successful, but nothing super successful. But the lessons that I learned along the way, super priceless.
00:14:02.102 - 00:14:12.190, Speaker C: And my goal with Stacks Ventures is really to save all of the founders that we invest in from making the same mistakes that I made. So I think that's part of the value that we bring to the table.
00:14:12.690 - 00:14:51.290, Speaker A: The amount of people I've seen who have learned some amount of entrepreneurship through gaming, like runescape for me or wow or Diablo, you learn about the free market and how to sell and all these different things, like the value of maybe holding now and reading the market, all these different things. But you mentioned entrepreneurship. It's kind of a young man's game is how it's touted. And entrepreneurship is also kind of in vogue in the past decade or so. Like everyone says they wants to do it. Do you think that in the broad landscape of just like people working jobs is entrepreneurship for most people?
00:14:51.440 - 00:15:23.300, Speaker C: I think it's for everyone, but I don't particularly think it's a young man's game. I think actually the vast majority of successful entrepreneurs are in their average successful entrepreneur. I think they have like twelve years of work experience. If you look at brick and mortar, business is 13 years. For a tech it's like twelve years. But the difference is if you start young, that's the fastest way to develop yourself as an entrepreneur. And of course talent plays into it a little bit.
00:15:23.300 - 00:15:57.662, Speaker C: I wouldn't be a very good basketball player. I'm not tall enough. I don't have the DNA. But I think in terms of entrepreneurship, anybody can do it. And I think what we're seeing with the creator economy is that more people are doing it. And so it doesn't mean like to be an entrepreneur, doesn't mean that you need to be the next Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk. That's pretty think, you know, maybe no one will be the next, you know, they'll be like one know.
00:15:57.662 - 00:16:44.102, Speaker C: But anybody can start something from nothing. Anybody can take an idea and bring it to life and we're becoming better at explaining how that actually works and teaching entrepreneurship as like a form of management, that's kind of the vision of lean startup. As Eric Reese's original vision was like lean startup. The goal is to turn the art of entrepreneurship into a management discipline. Just like 100 years ago, there was no MBA school, there was no idea of modern management 100 years ago. And so you look back 20 years ago compared to what we know now about how to build startups, it's completely night and day different. And we have much more best practices and frameworks that can allow anybody to work on a project.
00:16:44.102 - 00:17:25.100, Speaker C: And whether that be like you said, you're trying to build the next Amazon, or whether you're trying to build an NFT community or you're trying to build an open source project. Entrepreneurship is a skill that's valuable for everybody, whether you're an artist, a developer, or no matter what you want to do. If you want to work in a big company, you need to know understand innovation and entrepreneurship, because more and more big companies are facing the innovators dilemma and struggling to keep up with just the rapid pace of change that we're going through as a society and in the marketplace. So I think that everybody should at least dabble in entrepreneurship in their lives.
00:17:26.030 - 00:17:56.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I've definitely felt that there's like a switch to go from being a consumer to a producer. It's kind of a worldview shift where you're kind of looking for things that you can create or white space that it currently exists that isn't being served by the market. When you look at a good founder, what are the kind of characteristics or personality traits that make that top tier founder that people can kind of work on themselves and build?
00:17:57.530 - 00:18:51.634, Speaker C: I think the most important thing is rationality. So the ability to understand cognitive biases and sort of overcome them, the ability to make good judgment and good decisions. I think judgment is by far the most important thing in a good founder. But the cool thing is that your judgment can improve over time. I mean, the more experienced that you become, the more you learn, and your judgment improves from experience. And so you need to have work ethic, determination, drive. I would say the first most important thing, though, is that adaptability and rationality around being able to make good decisions based on data and intuition and taking feedback and listening to people who know it, who are giving valuable feedback, also just coachability.
00:18:51.634 - 00:19:31.220, Speaker C: So if you have too much drive and determination and not enough flexibility, you're almost guaranteed to fail because you're just going to go in the wrong direction and keep driving and being super stubborn. But if you can mix that drive and determination with the intellectual and strategic flexibility and that sort of level of rationality, then you're going to be super successful at some point, whether it's this business or the next business, staying intellectually humble and being driven, and also, I think, being guided by a higher purpose, you're going to bring a lot of value into the world.
00:19:32.310 - 00:20:20.946, Speaker A: Perfect. Okay, I'm going to take a slight left turn, move us into crypto land a little bit. And I want to start with you wrote a medium post in 2013 titled why bitcoin won't be a bubble. And it's crazy. There's certain things you read, like when you read the Bezos shareholder letters, especially like the ones in the late 90s, they feel like this is Amazon in the sense of like, everything he said 20 years ago is exactly, he just perfect vision, execution. But he had the right mindset from the jump. But it's funny as like a little time capsule to read this, because the first line says, as bitcoins reached mass market awareness, a debate has erupted as to whether bitcoin is a bubble or world changing technology.
00:20:20.946 - 00:20:38.540, Speaker A: Especially that first piece of, like, it's crossed the chasm almost a decade ago. It feels like we're still just crossing the chasm. But I'm curious for you, what do you find so fascinating about the crypto space?
00:20:39.630 - 00:21:06.660, Speaker C: Yeah, man, I totally forgot I wrote that. That's really mean. My original hypothesis on bitcoin was simply around remittances, an alternative to western union. For me, I really look at the use cases. I really look at what are people doing with it. Is there value for end users? A technology has no value without market application. And so I don't care what the technology is unless people can get value out of it.
00:21:06.660 - 00:21:40.858, Speaker C: The market cap of the technology is going to be based on the total sum number of users and the value that's created. Right. And the value that then can be captured by the business model. Right? So with bitcoin, it's like, well, it was pretty obvious in 2013. It's like the chinese government is restricting capital from flowing out of the country. And there's lots of billionaires there and there's lots of wealthy people, 2 billion people. Right? I guess it's actually, was it 1.4?
00:21:40.858 - 00:22:41.360, Speaker C: Okay. But you get the idea, like, there's a lot of money that goes through remittances. And bitcoin as a technology, 2013 was like a really good means to do that. And so what I was looking at was like, I looked at a report that actually Barry Silbert put out in DCG talking about if bitcoin was to capture the remittance market, then the market cap would be like $3,000 per coin, right? And so that's kind of like what I estimated. And that's why I started buying when it was like $100 and I bought a ton of it, and then it got up to like $1,000, and I bought on the way up and then got to $1,000. And then China banned it being used in remittances, and then you saw the value plummet from there. And for me, when I saw 2017 icos, I was like, listen, I live in the world of reality of building a business.
00:22:41.360 - 00:24:02.490, Speaker C: Most of the stuff I do with lean startup is like talking to founders and sort of crushing their dreams back into reality in a constructive way of helping them understand what it actually takes to be successful and what they need to do to be successful, and why their ideas aren't going to work if you can't get anybody to use it. And so when I saw the 2017 ICO craze, and you see companies raising tens of millions of dollars without anything built, it's like, this is madness and this is stupid. And so I stayed very clear away from it at that point. And then coming back into the 2020 cycle, that was when I first saw DFI and NFTs, and I saw people actually using it, and I saw that there are real applications being built on top of Ethereum and other blockchains other than bitcoin. And that was when I finally believed that this would be something. And then I worked backwards to understanding the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum, and how decentralized bitcoin is, how politically neutral it is. And that's when I really saw the value in stack specifically, because nothing will ever be created again that will be like bitcoin in the sense that it'll be politically neutral that'll be so decentralized.
00:24:02.490 - 00:25:48.390, Speaker C: But then, on the other hand, with Ethereum, they've actually proven that real people are going to get value out of this more so than just being a collective delusion of money. Right? Not there's any problem with that. I'm not trying to say that's a bad thing, but there's a big difference between a new Internet and a new computing platform, and the potential that that can be built on top of that with dows and new forms of governance and new forms of ownership, than just solving the double spend problem through bitcoin. It's not to minimize bitcoin, because the fact that Ethereum is working and can work, proves to me that bitcoin will come full circle and has the potential to become the world's money. I think that maybe that's a little bit different take than how some people think. But I went from being like, okay, I see the value of bitcoin, but how are we going to make this collective delusion work to really accept this as a global form of money? And then when I saw that actually so much more can be used on top of this, that this can actually be something that every single person on the earth has to use, not even just for money alone, but for things that cannot be built through the normal paradigm of building software. Then I worked back into it that, hey, this is really going to make it, and that this is going to be far bigger than anybody else expected.
00:25:48.390 - 00:25:57.950, Speaker C: And with stacks, building that on top of bitcoin, to me, seems like way more valuable than doing on top of Ethereum.
00:25:59.490 - 00:26:20.898, Speaker A: Yeah, I've heard you. I was watching your past interview with Brian Harrington. Shout out to Brian, and I think, especially bitcoin maxis, they understand the money part of it. Like, bitcoin is a store of value. It's won that narrative. We won't talk about the ETH ultrasound. That's Tom foolery.
00:26:20.898 - 00:26:57.810, Speaker A: But you mentioned something about the block space might be the most valuable thing about bitcoin. Kind of alluding to, like, it might not just be the BTC, that's the thing. It's the ledger, it's the settlement layer. And I think that's where a lot of people who still haven't kind of grocked web three, they don't put enough weight on that. What do you think that they're missing? What do you think will be the unlock? Because you've had that transformation where you were like, I was skeptical, now I'm fully bought in. It's where we're going. What are they missing?
00:26:58.950 - 00:27:41.434, Speaker C: Yeah, I just don't think they ever think about building software, you know what I'm saying? Or building apps. I think the vast majority of bitcoiners, first of all, are not developers. The ratio of developers in the stacks community, I mean, in the theorem community compared to bitcoin, it's like way more developers in the Ethereum community in terms of the actual users of the network. And then the stacks, it's obviously even higher. But I just think the vast majority of people that are not developers, they don't know anything about software, they don't think. They don't think about building products. And then I think the ones that are developers, they're not really like the entrepreneurial type developers.
00:27:41.434 - 00:28:43.746, Speaker C: They're not thinking about, what future innovative technology can I build? They're more sort of like hardcore engineers, where it's like, there's engineers, where it's like all they care about is, how can I make this server respond as fast as possible? How can I reduce this from ten milliseconds to nine milliseconds by changing my code to do this. I've hired a lot of developers for my different companies, and they're great engineers, they're great developers, but they don't think. Big picture. They miss sort of the forest for the trees. And so I think there's a lot of developers in the bitcoin community who, the ones who don't understand web three, they're really focused on the trees, they're not looking at the forest. And then everybody else who's against it, they just don't know anything about software. And so you're starting to see actually a lot more of the developers like Mac Corello, who is like a bitcoin core developer for a long time.
00:28:43.746 - 00:29:33.502, Speaker C: They're coming out here and they're being, listen, this maxi, toxic maxi stuff is bullshit. And it's incumbent upon us as a bitcoin community, if we're going to even survive, to look at what's happening in Ethereum and take the best practices that we can from them, study our competition, know them better than they know themselves, and then apply those things back to what we're doing, rather than just sort of like put our head in the sand and be like, oh, it's bullshit. It's like a very childish reaction to sort of just dismiss your competition. Instead, you should know your competition better than they know themselves. Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer. Not to say that bitcoin and ethereum are enemies. I think that they are very complementary, but they are competition.
00:29:33.502 - 00:30:09.854, Speaker C: So I think that's like, from my perspective, bitcoin is not guaranteed to make it. The Nazis could have won World War II. Russia, the Soviet Union could have been the first one to land on the moon. The good guys don't always win. The fact that bitcoin is so decentralized and so politically neutral, probably 80% of the world doesn't care, like 80% of the users out there. They only care about the actual using the product. Right? People use Facebook every day.
00:30:09.854 - 00:31:09.410, Speaker C: They don't care that Mark Zuckerberg is stealing all your data and monetizing your private information to the extent that he can, people still use it. And so we need to be very vigilant to protect and make sure that bitcoin succeeds. And if Ethereum, or if Ethereum, not trying to paint Ethereum, is the bad guy here, but another chain gets way more users and way more usage. And that chain is not decentralized like bitcoin, and not neutral in the way that bitcoin is, bitcoin could lose, and that would be a huge loss to the world and to society. And so it's incumbent upon us to implement the best of web three on top of bitcoin so that bitcoin can continue its hegemony and be the number one chain so that we can have the neutrality and decentralization of bitcoin.
00:31:10.630 - 00:31:53.342, Speaker A: Yeah, there's something weird about the bitcoin community where they almost like there's already so much momentum that I can just take my foot off the gas and this train is going to go. We went to the moon in the was like a period of nothing until Elon hops back on that train and maxis are like the, we're going to go to Mars just from the 60s launch. I'm just going to sit here and we're good to go. We're going to get there anyways. I don't think people realize that it takes that consistent effort over time by everyone, the entire community. And ethereum is this perfect experimentation basket that we can just pluck cherries from and bring them over.
00:31:53.476 - 00:32:12.920, Speaker C: Mean, you know, shout out to Tom, who created. Actually, I think he follows stacks. He actually follows me on Twitter. But hey, we could have had Tom from Myspace. He seems like a great guy. He probably wouldn't know monetizing and stealing our data like Zuckerberg. But instead we have, you know, the good guys don't always.
00:32:14.250 - 00:32:40.058, Speaker A: Right, okay, so speaking of good guys, Muneeb and Brian design, they were working on something on bitcoin way back, and thankfully through their journey of created this new thing trying to unleash bitcoin. But I'm curious about that kind of origin story. So how did you get connected to them and what was the first kind of meetings, like when you met Moonib and Ryan?
00:32:40.234 - 00:33:18.938, Speaker C: Yeah, so I met Ryan at an incubator space called Dog Patch Labs in New York City. It was like the first co working space incubator in the New York tech scene. This is like 2000 and maybe eleven. No, maybe 2010. Anyway, I was actually intern for the venture capital fund that ran the space, Polaris Ventures, and Ryan was also an intern there. Ryan's a couple years, a couple of years younger than me. And yeah, we just kind of hit it off and started going to different tech events together and made some mutual friends.
00:33:18.938 - 00:33:50.950, Speaker C: Ryan helped me organize this meetup that we did called the student New York tech meetup in the summer, which was like the New York tech meetup in New York is like huge. There's like 2000 people that attend. And I was organizing the student group. So we had students from all the different York City schools, Princeton, Harvard, you know, Columbia, NYU, et cetera, in sort of the northeast region. And he was helping me organize. Then, you know, a couple of years go by. I was doing the lean startup machine thing.
00:33:50.950 - 00:34:30.498, Speaker C: We kept in good touch with Ryan, always a super smart person and just great guy. And then he had met Maneib at Princeton, I think, through the computer science group and through the entrepreneurship group. And then, yeah, Ryan, just like, basically, we had lunch together one day. He's like, this is Maneb, and we're doing this thing. We're trying to start a business. I've been doing all this lean startup stuff, so he's, like, asking my advice on how to go to market and how to validate their ideas. And then I think it was like a year goes by.
00:34:30.498 - 00:35:05.150, Speaker C: I had actually just raised about $2 million for a lean startup machine to build software. And they were moving offices. I was like, oh, let me give you guys, there's two desks in my office. You can come take it. And so they moved up, and we're working out in my office for a little bit. And then they started raising money, and I was just sort of, like, coaching Ryan on how to raise capital, just like I do in the accelerator. A lot of the same tactics and fun lessons that I impart on all of our portfolio founders.
00:35:05.150 - 00:35:42.074, Speaker C: They raised money super quickly. They got into y combinator. I helped with their application, like, rewriting their applications. Like, I write emails for our founders. And, yeah, from there, I mean, I wasn't that involved after that, but I was just kind of there at that really beginning start where they were raising their first round and was helpful with that. And they went on to raise from some of the best investors in the world and build a great, fantastic team. And I was just always impressed over the years at their judgment and their great timing, and Ryan always had great timing with things.
00:35:42.074 - 00:36:26.840, Speaker C: I think that they tried a lot of things that didn't work as, like, when you look at what the previous thing was called. Blockstack. Right? And so blockstack was no token, just decentralized identity and storage, which is now Gaia storage and sort of has evolved also into BNS. They tried to do a lot of the things that the Maxis are doing now for many years to turn into a business. And I think eventually they realized when they saw Ethereum taking off, that, okay, they kind of came around to, here's why we need a token. Here's a technological reason. And that's when they decided to launch stacks at that.
00:36:26.840 - 00:36:57.874, Speaker C: You know, they've been in this industry for the longest time. And actually, when I first met them, when they first came to, like, they were the only people I knew in the New York scene who actually had read the source code of bitcoin. So when I was talking about bitcoin, I was very skeptical. Actually. My CTO at the time was know using bitcoin to buy things on the dark web, let's say. I won't say too much more than that, but that's how other people I knew were using it. And I was talking Eve and they were like, oh, no, this is how it works.
00:36:57.874 - 00:37:19.000, Speaker C: And they were so in depth on how it actually worked that I was like, oh, man, this could really be something. So that kind of got me into it. Unfortunately, I didn't stay into it. Lessons learned. But that's why time travel is the most powerful superpower. Because if you could just time travel back 2010, anybody could be a trillionaire now.
00:37:20.250 - 00:37:29.354, Speaker A: 100%. The white commoner application. Were they applying with blockstack at that time?
00:37:29.472 - 00:37:47.682, Speaker C: It was actually called one name at that point. So this was before Blockstack. I think they rebranded blockstack after y combinator. And so one name was just decentralized identity on the blockchain. What they did was they launched. If you google one name, you'll see some old screenshots. You'll see like an old picture of me on the landing page.
00:37:47.682 - 00:38:15.098, Speaker C: And it was just a way to register basically like BNS. It was basically like ENS or Bns before that existed. And they created a little landing page. It was very actually like lean, startup oriented. Like they created a landing page and they had people register and they sent it out through social media. And then they got all these top Silicon Valley vcs to register their domain name on it. It's such a simple one feature product.
00:38:15.098 - 00:38:38.846, Speaker C: You know what I'm saying? This is what I always tell people, one feature, build a product. That's one feature. If you can do that and you've identified with the killer features, you build one feature, that's the fastest way to be successful. That's literally what they did with one name. They built one feature, like, just register your name. Then they got from now from DCG to register his name, Naval Ravikant, to register a name. All the vcs registered their names.
00:38:38.846 - 00:39:09.606, Speaker C: And then that's how they raised their round, like overnight, because people were using their product. And when VCC, other vcs are using their product, they get super, um. It was very clever and it was very lean and they validated the product and raised capital in one go. And then it later became blockstack where they started to think, know, adding decentralized storage into. So, you know, it's kind of funny. Blockstack could have been ens, it could have been ipfs. But finally it's become stacks.
00:39:09.606 - 00:39:15.630, Speaker C: And I think that in the end it'll all be worth it. And stacks could be something bigger than both of those combined.
00:39:16.770 - 00:39:45.734, Speaker A: Very cool. Okay, I'm going to take another left turn. I want to make sure we cover stacks ventures for a low pocket, actually, before we jump into that in your definition, because I'm learning as I go. I had an image of what vcs did, but that's been eroding over time. They're very busy. I used to think you guys just kind of like sit in a room and you just pluck out good companies and you write checks and they just wait and it's like, it is what it is.
00:39:45.852 - 00:39:58.966, Speaker C: That's what the later stage vcs do. That's not what the accelerators were really busy. But once we graduate, then I'll be at the golf course, just chilling, basically retired.
00:39:59.158 - 00:40:09.710, Speaker A: Yeah. In your mind, what does a properly working VC do? What does that entail?
00:40:13.430 - 00:40:45.260, Speaker C: It's easy to kind of punch up against vcs. They're kind of easy target, I think. There's typically three roles in a VC fund. So you typically have partners with different specializations, and there's kind of three different specializations that a VC firm needs. So one is investor relations. And so that includes meeting with lps and networking with other vcs. That's like one sort of full time thing.
00:40:45.260 - 00:41:10.062, Speaker C: Some people are good at that, some people aren't good at that. The next thing is operating. So actually working hands on with companies and helping them to run their business and helping them be more successful. Right. That's another role of a VC. The third role is then deal making. So actually getting into deals.
00:41:10.062 - 00:41:44.554, Speaker C: So being able to meet a founder, convince them to work with you, convince them to take your money, work out a deal, get into the best deals. So those are the three roles a VC needs to have. I think typically most vcs are better at the first and third one. They don't typically tend to be as good at the operating one. And the operating one probably gets the least credit because really, actually I think the most important one is just the deal making. Right. If you can be good with, but it requires also investor relations skills.
00:41:44.554 - 00:42:08.230, Speaker C: But probably the most important skill of a VC is like being buddies with founders. You may have no redeeming quality at all, you may know nothing, you may have no experience, no knowledge, no skills. But if you can make deals with founders, you can generate good returns as a VC. And so that's sort of the unfortunate reality of life and venture capital.
00:42:09.130 - 00:42:24.346, Speaker A: So when you say deal making, that's like being able to actually close cut the check. Because when they say it's default alive kind of thing, you need to have the money to sustain to get over that chasm, is that what you mean?
00:42:24.528 - 00:43:33.550, Speaker C: No, what I mean is that there's certain companies where it's so obvious, let's say Jack Dorsey starts his next company. Okay? Everyone wants to invest in that for these really obvious. What we do at the accelerator we do at Sax ventures is not really that we're investing much earlier than that. Somebody like, look at what Maneib did, right? Like he raised 150,000,000 off the jump for trust machines, okay? Getting into rounds like that is what I mean by deal making, where it's like someone can get anyone they want to invest in it, you know what I mean? And vcs have to fight to get into it. How are you going to get your money in that round? Right? And so actually being a better operator really helps with that, right? But it may not be like one for one related, right? Just like when I was a wrestler, I thought going to the gym, the more I can bench press, the better I'll do as a wrestler. But really, actually just technique mattered the most. Just being really good at technique.
00:43:33.550 - 00:44:26.466, Speaker C: Similar with deal making. If you're just really good at deal making, maybe you don't know anything. You have no skill as an operator, but you can still get into the good deals. But what we do with sax ventures, of course, we're trying to invest in the most competitive rounds as possible. But really we're building a competency for identifying the hidden gems, the diamond in the rough. We're discovering undiscovered talent and we're actually creating value. As opposed to trying to be the last person on the bus, we're trying to be the first check in and identify really good developers who other people don't know about and validate them and help them to fix maybe like one key thing with their company, that's going to change them from being one of many to one of a kind.
00:44:26.648 - 00:44:39.160, Speaker A: So if you're a founder and you're intrigued by stacks and you potentially join the accelerator or get kind of in the purview of Stacks ventures, what are you looking for?
00:44:40.010 - 00:45:38.966, Speaker C: I think the most important thing is having a validated idea. If your idea is actually something that makes sense, it's going to work in the market that has validation behind it and fits into the patterns of what we're seeing be really, you know, the pre accelerator is a really good place to go. Albert is running a fantastic program there where it actually helps you to get feedback from all the different entities in the ecosystem and figure out something that is really needed to be built that can help, that's going to get traction and going to be successful. From the jump, we're looking for founders who can find an easy way to do something difficult. So we're looking for not necessarily an obvious idea, but when you tell me this idea, it's fucking obvious. This is a brilliant idea, and it's going to make a lot of money and be really successful, we're looking for. And that your way to execute it is going to be very simple.
00:45:38.966 - 00:47:24.474, Speaker C: And so it's kind of like, if you ask me to think of one of those ideas right now on the spot, I could maybe think of one or two, just because we're always meeting these ideas. But the bar for having something that can be really successful really easily is like what we're looking for. And then just seeing that the team is complete, so that you have the classic three roles that we look for in a team is the hustler, the hacker, and the hipster. So the hustler is that business founder who's going to be really successful at raising, who's charming, who can attract talent, who is resilient, that's coachable, and can do marketing, and is able to go out there and be, we say, squeaky as a wheel, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, tactfully and tastefully shameless out there promoting the business. And then the hacker, so the blockchain engineer, the smart contract engineer, the back end guy, who's going to really build some world class intellectual property and technology that's going to be scalable and performant and bring a lot of value. And then the hipster who's the front end person, the person who's going to build the UI, the user interface, so that your users can actually use that backend technology and create a world class product, whether it be a mobile app or a web app, that you're going to be competitive in the broader market. Because to be successful as a startup, the key is to do is less, is more, to do as little as possible, but to be world class in everything you do, and the only way to be world class in everything you do is to do as little as possible.
00:47:24.474 - 00:48:20.466, Speaker C: And so that's what's going to make you successful as a founder. That's what we're looking to invest in because the bar for being successful is so high. It's so difficult and so challenging to be successful as an entrepreneur that you need to stack the deck in your favor. You know what need to, you need to go to Vegas with the card counters from MIT and know that you have a hot hand coming up because that's the only way to be successful. There's so many things that could go wrong and it's so difficult that I think unless you want to start like a lifestyle business or a small business or a consulting business, those are much more easily to be successful because you're not going for venture capital style returns to actually build a unicorn business. We don't expect all of our founders to do that, actually. We want our founders to have a lot of doubles and triples as exits as opposed to a unicorn.
00:48:20.466 - 00:49:09.210, Speaker C: But even to do that, you need everything in your favor. And it would be irresponsible of me to invest in something where we're setting a founder off on a path where they're going to only result in pain in their lives. Because I've failed. I've had a lot of things fail. And the thing that people don't talk about is it sucks and it's extremely painful and it will literally take years off the end of your life and bring you to the edge of your own sanity. And that's not something that I wish on anybody. And so that's why I'm so strict when it comes to wanting founders to take every possible precaution in aligning their business to be successful.
00:49:11.090 - 00:49:54.522, Speaker A: Perfect for founders listing. I don't think that can be understated of the, it's like you want someone like Trevor in your corner to give you short term pain for long term benefit. And I've seen it myself where when you're on a call, especially when I first joined, I was like, man, this guy, he's kind of a jerk. He's going hard right now. But over time, and I've seen you do it like you might call someone out in the community, but it's always mission driven. It's always like the greater goal is there. And so it's like the people that do give you that constructive criticism, especially when it's unflinching, it's worth its weight and gold for sure.
00:49:54.522 - 00:50:06.830, Speaker A: Because the long term pain of you could have gotten good data, someone could have told you this thing to make you do a right. Civil left is just, you can avoid so much heartache.
00:50:08.850 - 00:51:59.138, Speaker C: It's hard work. It'd be much easier not to be like, I try to be very delicate in being critical, right? But it's not fun, you know what I'm saying? It's not fun to be critical of founders, especially because I, I love founders so much. I am a founder, but it's like sort of a moral responsibility to give your blunt and maybe unpleasant feedback all the time because most vcs, they don't give any negative feedback. In fact, it doesn't benefit me as a VC to give any founder any negative feedback ever, because what I should do as a VC is just sort of treat everybody like an option. You know what I'm saying? Some vcs, they take this perspective of like, I'm just a money allocator and I'm not going to have any impact on any business, right? And so that's actually a pretty good strategy because you're only going to pick the winners, you're not going to help create the winners, right? And if you just pick the winners, well then someone who you think, especially if your vc comes from like a finance background or a background where you don't actually know how the sausage is made, you could be talking to someone and think it's a dumb idea, a month later, they could be raising money from the best investors in the world. And so if you give them negative feedback or you tell them that they're wrong or try to argue with them, you're only hurting your chances of making a deal with them to get in the round later, right? And so the vast majority of vcs just nod their heads and say, oh, that's great, I love it. In fact, when I raised money for my first company, I met with 100 vcs who all said, well, it's great, I love it.
00:51:59.138 - 00:52:52.740, Speaker C: And not one of those 100 people actually invested, you know what I'm saying? They just nod their heads and then like, great, do you want to invest? They're like, yeah, let me get back to you. I definitely want to, let me get back to you. But I just feel like eventually the founders are going to look back on that and they're going to appreciate that, even if they maybe dislike me in the short term or if I'm not able to deliver the feedback delicately enough. But at the same time, that's how I would want to be treated. And I try as a VC, I think it's our policy. It's not like we never want to poo poo on anybody, you know what I'm saying? We want to try to explain and try to offer advice and give perspective and ultimately we're not in the driver's seat. It's not our company.
00:52:52.740 - 00:53:01.510, Speaker C: We're just sharing our feedback and thoughts and a way that hopefully can benefit the founders.
00:53:02.410 - 00:53:41.140, Speaker A: Okay, I want to start to bring this to a close. I want to try a new style, maybe a little rapid fire ish session on some things that have been interesting me in the crypto space and just kind of like, spitball your take on these. So one of them is we're seeing there's Dolly now, which can create these amazing images out of thin air, almost. More and more coding tools are coming along to make it easier to code. GitHub, copilot, no code tools. And so I'm seeing there's digital scarcity, that blockchain kind of like, brings. And then there's technical abundance that these tools keep layering on.
00:53:41.140 - 00:53:58.300, Speaker A: How do you see that intersection? I know it's kind of a crazy big topic, but I don't know how to wrestle with that idea. And so as a VC, it seems interesting that that landscape seems to be shifting. How do you view those two things of digital scarcity and technical abundance tools coming online?
00:54:00.590 - 00:54:32.226, Speaker C: Yeah, that's fascinating. What are you making me think of? I don't have a well formed thought on this because you're just throwing this at me, but I think technology sort of happens on the edges, like at the extremes, right? Yeah, it's fascinating. Digital scarcity. I mean, in some ways. In some ways, we don't have pure digital scarcity. It's like, really up to. There's more and more nfts out right there.
00:54:32.226 - 00:55:12.560, Speaker C: There's more and more tokens and stuff like that. But it's more like digital scarcity in terms of, like, a flight, a flight to quality, right. And I think that the accessibility of the Internet tends to lead to power law outcomes, right. So when anything is a click away, people only go for the first and the best. Right. So while there is a ton of abundance, we're also seeing a gravitation towards consolidation of power law, distribution, of more inequality. You know what I'm saying? And so in today's world, inequality is actually raising more and more, polarization is increasing more and more.
00:55:12.560 - 00:56:17.300, Speaker C: And I think it's just sort of a. We're in a society right now where I guess most of the systems that we've known over the last 100 years are breaking down. Like capitalism is sort of breaking down in interesting ways, where we're seeing more inequality. And I don't know what the answer is, man, but I think that in a way blockchain to me represents more of a meritocracy. So with respect to dows, with respect to ownership, I think that the goal of bitcoin people say, which I agree with, is to separate money from the state, right? That's such a noble purpose. The goal of web three is to separate data and ownership from corporations to everyone, and to allow more people to have voice in our economy with things that we own. Right, like our personal property.
00:56:17.300 - 00:56:41.680, Speaker C: And so with respect to that, I think we're moving in the right direction. And that's why I see blockchain and web three being a panacea to a lot of the ails that we have in our current society, and sort of how capitalism is breaking down. I hope that the sort of decentralized nature of web three can help provide a new alternative and a better direction for us to move forward in the future.
00:56:43.010 - 00:57:27.130, Speaker A: That's a great response on the fly. Well done, Trevor. Okay, last little spitball question I've been thinking about is someone on Twitter brought up, they were getting in fights with bitcoin maxis, and they were talking about tokens are kind of like proxy equity. And that idea is fascinating, where it's like equity is this idea that you can put in money and you get a percentage of a business, but there's like securities laws and there's accredited investor laws, and it feels very archaic. It feels unattainable to someone like me at my stage. But tokens feel much more transparent, democratic in some sense, accessible. How do you think about this idea of tokens are kind of proxy equity?
00:57:27.870 - 00:58:08.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's what I think as well. I think that the closest analogy to tokens is a form of equity, and it should represent an ownership share over an open source protocol. And so I think of tokens as like decentralized equity because it's only not a security if it's decentralized. So by that nature, a token must be decentralized equity in order for it not to be a security. And so there's many open source. Open source has a long history, well before blockchain, if you look at stacks, ethereum, et cetera, they're all open source. And that's what makes it not a security, is that there's multiple different companies and stakeholders.
00:58:08.194 - 00:58:46.130, Speaker C: You're not dependent on any one company to grow the thing. And so that's what makes it a proxy of equity or a decentralized form of equity. And that is super exciting because it allows it to, like you said, be approachable for everyone. You know what I'm saying? And it allows it to be transparent, accountable, and open to the world. So I think that we're moving towards a world where we don't need all these institutions to oversee things. We have the skills and tools to do it ourselves.
00:58:47.690 - 00:59:02.490, Speaker A: I think tokens are decentralized. Equity might be the bar of the episode. Like, that's a t shirt, that's a bumper sticker. That's so succinct. I love that. Okay, last question. I like to end on a high note, so thinking like forward looking.
00:59:02.490 - 00:59:23.506, Speaker A: So I'm imagining you can do whatever you want. Maybe you're staying at stacks ventures, crushing it, and you're executing just perfectly, all guns blazing, things are going smoothly. What do you see yourself in five years? What does that perfect dream, Trevor, look like five years from now?
00:59:23.688 - 01:00:09.598, Speaker C: Yeah. So my ultimate goal in life, like my dream in life is to start an orphanage. So I love educating, I love helping other people, and so if I make the big bucks someday, what I'd want to do is I want to invest all in that and starting, ideally, the world's biggest orphanage because I'd want to allow, and this is going to be like a high tech orphanage. All the kids from this orphanage are going to go to Harvard, Stanford, or start their own schools that are better than Harvard. Or know just the ability. Know. Why I love working with early stage founders is because I can have such a big, I can take, we can take something that's very moldable and make it, like I said, from one of many to one of a kind.
01:00:09.598 - 01:00:53.280, Speaker C: And so the ability to, what I'm most interested in is having the biggest impact possible on, not like having a small impact on a ton of people, but having a massive impact on a few people to me is more satisfying. And that's kind of like what I did with my previous work at lean startup machine. It was really about opening people's minds to a new way of thinking. And so to be able to do that with people who were given an unfair shake in life and to be able to help, not just put them on the right path, but put them on the high road, the first class path, is kind of like my dream and my ultimate goal in my life.
01:00:54.850 - 01:01:20.120, Speaker A: That's amazing. Yeah. There's something about mindset is a cliche term that everyone kind of throws around, but as someone who grew up very timid and shy, when I look at myself now, it's like a different person that I couldn't even fathom back then. And so even this podcast is kind of like that, where it's like, one, I'm pushing myself, but two, I'm trying to hopefully inspire one or two people to listen this episode and do that thing.
01:01:21.530 - 01:01:21.846, Speaker C: So.
01:01:21.868 - 01:01:28.200, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds freaking incredible, dude. Yeah, that's great.
01:01:29.290 - 01:01:58.370, Speaker C: Well, that's why people love watching your podcast, dude, because people know that you're just approaching it from such a genuine perspective. And I remember when I first saw you recording on Twitter. I forget where I first saw you, but I was super excited and jazzed about that, you know, starting this podcast. And I'm just so grateful to you to see how far you've come and how much effort you've put into supporting the stacks ecosystem. So hats off to you, Jake, for all that you've done.
