00:00:00.400 - 00:00:01.084, Speaker A: That's right.
00:00:02.134 - 00:00:24.798, Speaker B: All right, welcome back, everybody, to the show with no name. Back with the squad. They're back from NYC. Got Bob here as usual, and Charlie and. Whoa, Donnie, you just unlocked the bomb. But real quick, Charlie and Donnie, you guys are back. We had someone film last time, but quick vibe check.
00:00:24.798 - 00:00:27.094, Speaker B: How was NFT NYC?
00:00:27.474 - 00:01:12.264, Speaker C: Yeah, NFT NYC was basically a great confirmation that the, that the bitcoin takeover of, like, all other events that aren't exclusively bitcoin is real. Like the ETH Denver phenomenon continues at NFT NYC. I didn't even go to the NFT conference. I just went to the side events. And it was also really validated because there's a lot of really smart, good people in New York and we were able to kind of gather at natural shelling points like pub key or some restaurant. So, yeah, the ordinals phenomenon is not just a one time off East Denver event.
00:01:13.164 - 00:01:13.724, Speaker A: Nope.
00:01:13.804 - 00:01:39.392, Speaker D: And I'll echo that and say that it was like packing a month worth of stuff into three or four days. I don't think I've ever been that busy or that pulled in so many directions. Not only did we sponsor a bunch of things, but, like, there were so many other valuable spaces to be in, full of people who have things I want to hear when they talk, you know what I mean? And every time I go to any conference, I go to the conference because.
00:01:39.488 - 00:01:40.648, Speaker E: Everybody else is like, why would I.
00:01:40.656 - 00:01:59.956, Speaker D: Go to the conference? There's not an ordinals booth. And I'm like, I should go to the conference because there's not an ordinals booth. I want to know what's going on in the outside world. And I thought this back when I was, like, into Solana and I wanted to see what Ethereum was doing, and I think its really good to get a diverse perspective. So I never listened to anyone when they say, dont go to the conference. This is the one time I shouldve. It was $620 for a ticket.
00:01:59.956 - 00:02:02.868, Speaker D: And there literally isnt a conference.
00:02:02.956 - 00:02:04.100, Speaker A: There were like six booths.
00:02:04.132 - 00:02:26.664, Speaker D: There was one tapestry in the middle of the room. It looked like they just were breaking down for the last hour of the last day, the whole time. Truly offensive. I was livid. I walked in and I was like, why is this the most expensive conference? And it's like, it. It's like they didn't even. They, like, sent one of the interns to help a few people set something up.
00:02:26.664 - 00:02:36.456, Speaker D: It was like, truly offensive. So everybody out there, when people tell you not to go to the conference, don't usually listen to them. This one, pretend it's not there. It's just, it's a temporal meeting space.
00:02:36.520 - 00:02:37.096, Speaker A: That's all it is.
00:02:37.120 - 00:02:39.388, Speaker D: The venue was like. It was truly offensive.
00:02:39.496 - 00:02:39.812, Speaker A: It.
00:02:39.868 - 00:02:58.356, Speaker C: NFT NYC is a good forward looking indicator for the trajectory of nfts on other blockchains and the ordinals space is a good forward looking indicator. These the in person events, a good forward looking indicator of the energy that's on, uh, the mother chain. It is wild.
00:02:58.460 - 00:02:58.844, Speaker A: The.
00:02:58.924 - 00:03:03.904, Speaker C: The disparity between these two, uh, uh, movements right now.
00:03:05.864 - 00:03:06.392, Speaker E: I love it.
00:03:06.408 - 00:03:10.244, Speaker B: We're coming out guns blazing. Pew. Pew east was the testnet.
00:03:11.464 - 00:03:15.152, Speaker D: I'm just making fun of the organization of the conference. I wasn't saying anything about it.
00:03:15.288 - 00:03:23.992, Speaker B: I saw photos and I'm like, I can't tell if this the one shot where he showed up at 06:00 a.m. Or if this is like at four. But yeah, it was miserable.
00:03:24.048 - 00:03:25.408, Speaker D: It was really miserable. Crazy.
00:03:25.536 - 00:03:31.844, Speaker B: Crazy. And then we got a guest on the show today, Mister Matt Luongo. How you doing, sir?
00:03:32.144 - 00:03:40.444, Speaker A: Doing all right. Very loud ac behind me. That will definitely fix in post production, but, yeah, doing okay. Thanks for having me all.
00:03:41.224 - 00:04:01.770, Speaker B: Glad to have you. Glad to have you. So, yeah, got a couple topics. This is gonna be kind of almost like a philosophical episode. We're gonna go deep into kind of game theory type of stuff. And I think the first prompt is something that you said, Matt, at East Denver on stage, there was like an l two panel, got heated at times. You mentioned some things about, like, fee burning, and it got a little testy.
00:04:01.770 - 00:04:39.488, Speaker B: But one thing that you kind of sounds like you brought up, but you can make sure I get the framing right, is that there's this question about what is, what's better for the long term security of bitcoin. Is it making sure the miners get paid maximally? And this is things like l two is passing fees down to miners and this incentive alignment, if you will. And then there's another side of optimizing for holders, which is where things like fee burning can actually be net benefit for holders. And which one benefits the long term security tomorrow with bitcoin? So if that's right, I'd love to jump into this kind of topic and give us some other color about this framing.
00:04:39.616 - 00:05:06.084, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Like, so, look, I have some strong positions, but they're loosely held, right. I could. I can be convinced, but it has been about a decade that I've built this position, so maybe it'll take more than just this call. So my thoughts is right before the block size debate finally resolved. We all gave, we treated miners like they ran the network and that was wrong. Right.
00:05:06.084 - 00:05:57.030, Speaker A: We had like a really nice object lesson that miners don't run the network, users run the network, and the economic majority ultimately decides what is bitcoin. And for, you know, not for you guys, but for other people listening to this, what happened was the miners got pushy and they aligned with a bunch of application developers and corporations. This led to this New York agreement and this Segwit two x ito that ended up being a failure. The thought was it was a compromise between, ok, we're going to activate Segwit, but we're also going to have a two megabyte base block size increase. So it doubling before Segwit. And, you know, Segwit two X. For me, I was a big blocker and.
00:05:57.030 - 00:06:18.214, Speaker A: But it for me was this clarifying moment where I was just like, this is messed up. Like, there should not actually be people in a shadowy room in New York talking and making these decisions. This is ridiculous. And the precedent that it sets can't, like, I have, you know, I'm an application dev. And so I wanted give me to more network, give me more space. But after this, I became a small blocker. Basically.
00:06:18.214 - 00:07:02.534, Speaker A: It took me a little bit of licking my wounds, but I just realized that's messed up and we cannot possibly. This isn't the system I signed up for. The thing that helped Segwit two x that made sure it failed ultimately was something, this movement led partially by Luke Dash Junior, which is this idea of user activated soft fork. And so what UASF basically said, and I'm just like, broad strokes is, yeah, if you guys do this, we're all gonna go. And we don't really care what the miners say, we can go nuclear, we can change work, we do all sorts of stuff. And it was this threat, and we didn't see it play out, thankfully. It would have been a mess, but it was this threat that really held.
00:07:02.534 - 00:07:12.778, Speaker A: I think it's what tipped everyone to. To not support two x. Also, there's a bunch of other issues where the code base was garbage. And I'm glad we didn't activate it because we're broken bitcoin. Yeah.
00:07:12.906 - 00:07:15.094, Speaker C: There's a lot of other nuke their first block.
00:07:15.434 - 00:07:42.256, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, yeah. So it was a mess. But, like, the learning for me was, you know, you think one group has power, but eventually, like, bitcoin is f you money. And this was a beautiful demonstration of, like, you know, and so one of my takeaways from this is we saw a bunch of people basically exit bitcoin. And some of them did it for good economic reasons, and some of them did it like spoiled children. And we saw a little bit of both.
00:07:42.256 - 00:08:29.470, Speaker A: Right? We saw miners who got less involved in governance because they kind of got their hand slapped. We saw some exchanges, I won't name any names, who pivoted pretty hard away from bitcoin and never really came back. And so it was a huge lesson for me. And, like, what is the role of a miner? So if we believe that proof of work is what I think we all believe it is, which is a permissionless way to basically progress the chain, but that the rules of the network are enforced by nodes. And the nodes that matter are the nodes that have economy behind them. They're the nodes that have personal value and a use case behind them. Then ultimately what matters is what the economic majority wants.
00:08:29.470 - 00:09:15.704, Speaker A: And miners are about progressing the chain and making sure that if they're censored, someone else can step in their place. So for me, that's the beauty of proof of work that we don't get from other mechanisms. So if we think all of that's true, well, the miners work for us. They don't control what happens on the network. And so that brings us to l two s, right? Anything with an l two, any talk of an l two, even Metaproco. What we're talking about is we're changing what people get paid to do in bitcoin, and that's kind of a dangerous thing. So in the same way that it's dangerous to add an opcode that could lead to a bug we didn't have before, instability, it's dangerous to pay people differently.
00:09:15.704 - 00:10:01.614, Speaker A: So for me, I'm like, okay, when I look at merge mining and basically anything that has since bitcoin consensus, I'm like, great. So now we have a party that's completely maybe unaligned with the network, that's bribing miners to do things that maybe aren't good for the network. And so that's my concern. And if you look at something like Ethereum, who's going to decide if there's a major contentious fort? So we know what happened in the past, it was like developers, but today, USDT and USDC have a lot of say over what fork is real. And I don't want to see that happen in bitcoin. And so that's why I'm interested in, okay, how do we, how do we reward the economic majority rather than Robbie miners. Sorry it's long winded, but there you go.
00:10:03.514 - 00:10:36.814, Speaker C: I think I generally agree. I say like economic participants, a majority. I say like bitcoin. Security and consensus derives. We've seen it derive historically from like node participants and economic participants. I still kind of wax a little bit like mystical about it because I like to say that we've seen how it has worked, but we don't know for sure how it will work. I would hope that security would drive from the people actually using bitcoin.
00:10:36.814 - 00:11:19.844, Speaker C: I even go see more stuff, broaden the definition of losing a bitcoin to people holding and stacking bitcoin. I'm actually myself. I'll probably take a little bit of a flip on Matt's perspective. And I actually think miners will participate more in the future than they historically have. I think probably the next soft work may not be miner driven, but it will have a much larger role from miners play in it. Just due to the fact that I think it's going to require a lot more hash rate buy in than before. Previously the block says war.
00:11:19.844 - 00:11:32.556, Speaker C: You had all the hash rate concentrated in the hands of Jian Woo. And maybe it's not quite the same anymore, but I think we do have a little bit more different landscape. Yeah.
00:11:32.580 - 00:11:53.998, Speaker E: So Matt, what's your thought on the long tail issuance? Do we change the block subsidy? Do we add something like an EIP 1559 to bitcoin? I'm curious on.
00:11:54.126 - 00:12:14.788, Speaker A: I love how you're just laying these minds out for me to just step right onto. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Look, were I got, were I able to make changes to bitcoin that were not controversial, yeah, maybe there would be a tail issuance, but Im not. And thats the beauty of bitcoin. Its like, I cant do that.
00:12:14.788 - 00:12:41.804, Speaker A: And I think that its completely untenable. Like, I dont see any change to fee mechanisms outside of extensions on other layers. So Im looking at this two ways. If you're a bitcoin, l two, and you're, I mean, you know, they'll say there are three or four. But I look at it two ways. If you're a bitcoin, l two, and you're like, okay, how do I. First, I'm going to skip over the definition of l two because I think that all of that is b's.
00:12:41.804 - 00:12:49.216, Speaker A: So what I'm saying is if you're an economic layer, which is my preference, then what you need to do is.
00:12:49.240 - 00:12:55.174, Speaker E: Like economic layers, meaning you contribute fees directly back to the l one.
00:12:55.214 - 00:13:04.966, Speaker A: Is that, that's what matters to me is you contribute fees back to the l one. And the question becomes, there's a little bit more in my head, but like the question becomes how? Like how do you contribute back?
00:13:05.030 - 00:13:05.446, Speaker E: Sure.
00:13:05.550 - 00:13:34.684, Speaker A: And yeah, for me, like what? I mean, we just, we made this term up because we were looking for a way to categorize work we're doing. And it's like, what does economically, I mean, it has to use bitcoin. Like it can't be some other asset that you're using for gas and stuff like that. That's not cool. And then value needs to accrue to l one, but it also needs to accrue to bitcoin holders. So in our particular case for designs we played with, that means bitcoin holders staking their bitcoin are earning more on it. So things similar to routing fees on lightning.
00:13:34.684 - 00:14:19.634, Speaker A: But for me, the important thing with economic layer is like, okay, is this net positive for bitcoin? Because you can imagine a world where emerge mine chain is not. And so to avoid that, I see two ways outside of like minor bribes. One is a burn which pisses everyone off. It's a great thing to say on a panel and I'm interested in it. And I think the only problem that I have with the burn, I mean, for one, anyone who is involved with counterparty knows, like you're probably going to regret burning bitcoin later. So I think that's one issue is just like no one wants to be a historical laughing stock. But I think the other issue is the amount that you can actually impact bitcoin's issuance through a burn.
00:14:19.634 - 00:15:16.524, Speaker A: You have to be very big for that to actually be much of an impact. The other idea that I like here is, well, okay, if we're concerned about long term consensus stability, why don't you just lock bitcoin up? Anyone can spend for like 20 years, make it 30, make it 40, and it starts to become, it's effectively the same as burnt. For a short term market cycle, you're taking things out of circulation. But miners can't really complain anymore because right now their complaint is, no, no, no, we're very aligned with the bitcoin network. And you're like, you're very aligned with the asics you own, right, which is almost the same, but it's not the same. And if you really want to be aligned, show us that you're like not like a big net seller of bitcoin, which is obviously impossible as a miner today. So I think another way to say it is like, no, no, we're going to give you the bribe.
00:15:16.524 - 00:15:20.204, Speaker A: You're going to have to stay in business for a long time to get it.
00:15:21.864 - 00:15:56.174, Speaker D: Interesting. Can I ask a question, Courtney? This might sound stupid if bitcoin is a network where miners are financially incentivized to do the thing that people are paying them to do, and eventually the subsidy, the coinbase, runs out and it runs on transaction fees because it's all too expensive. At that point, it doesn't really matter what are we worried about breaking? Or, I guess, what territory are we worried about stepping over if we just let it go the way it's going? Why do we even have to have these conversations?
00:15:59.114 - 00:16:32.906, Speaker A: I'm interested in you guys takes. I'm not an alarmist, necessarily, about the security budget. I think that we have been doing various forms of cope on the budget almost since day one. And Nick Carter has some killer writing on this. But most of that cope does rely on price appreciation. And I think the reason, I mean, I'm going to be frank, I'm not an NFT enjoyer. What I loved about ordinals is fee market.
00:16:32.906 - 00:16:55.364, Speaker A: Like that, for me, was like, hell, yeah, we finally saw some move. So I think the question is just like, if you look at ordinals, for example, fees, it's very spiky. And what you don't want is you don't want a fee market to be spiky and then to have just like, incredibly slow blocks and, like, difficulty using the network and retargeting it expanding. But, yeah, you guys might have more of a take here than I do.
00:16:55.704 - 00:17:56.404, Speaker C: I'm the same way as you, Matt. I feel that it's been largely not terribly concerning, although I was actually mostly concerned that we had not been empirically demonstrating a use for Bigland's block space and a general rejection of a cultural rejection of let's do anything but the lightning network. So, to me, that's why I even really got most interested in ordinals in the first place, because it opened up this Pandora's box, and the first thing that flew out are jpegs. But many other things will come out of this box both scary and amazing. And that is what makes you very excited. So, to me, if you are to be long ordinals type ideas, is like one of the most optimistic things for, you know, fending off the. The tail issuance, you know, voices in the room.
00:17:58.064 - 00:18:08.084, Speaker D: Like the question I always. Sorry, I'm like the youngest bitcoiner in here. Not like I'm age wise, I'm probably one of the oldest people all the time, everywhere I go.
00:18:08.504 - 00:18:09.808, Speaker E: But like, I've been paying attention to.
00:18:09.816 - 00:18:46.108, Speaker D: Bitcoin the shortest amount of time. So my viewpoints are not really, maybe they're not colored by old school bitcoin thought, but they're also really not as informed as old school bitcoin thought. So the tail issuance argument always seemed kind of strange to me because by the time we get to the point in 120 years, or however long that is, that that is occurring, the block reward is already minuscule to the point where transaction fees have long since hopefully taken over for that. So even considering that conversation at this point in time just seems so absurd. But I guess if every time this black reward goes down by half, everybody goes, is it going to be enough? And it's always been enough.
00:18:46.276 - 00:18:47.268, Speaker B: Why do we think it's not going.
00:18:47.276 - 00:18:49.252, Speaker D: To be enough if we're using that right.
00:18:49.348 - 00:18:56.644, Speaker C: That's where my brain, to be a concern. It just, big one has to demonstrate that it's not a concern, which it always does.
00:18:56.804 - 00:18:57.724, Speaker E: Yeah, it always.
00:18:57.804 - 00:18:58.492, Speaker D: So far.
00:18:58.628 - 00:18:58.892, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:58.908 - 00:19:01.412, Speaker E: And so far, you know, I like.
00:19:01.428 - 00:19:06.736, Speaker A: To think of it as like, is the having priced in? Of course it's not priced in by.
00:19:06.760 - 00:19:07.440, Speaker E: Most of the world.
00:19:07.512 - 00:19:33.044, Speaker A: Of course not. No. But a different way to think of it is we talk about how bitcoin's monetary policy is sacrosanct and doesn't change. It changes every four years. And so I would think of it like that, where it's like, yeah, it is different that now there's a halving with an ETF. If you look at where money is flowing, that is a very different thing than it was. And so I don't think that there's next having or two halvings or whatever, everything stops working.
00:19:33.044 - 00:20:00.240, Speaker A: But I do think that we have to help make sure there's a fee market. We can't just be like, oh, no, don't build on bitcoin. These things will just solve themselves. It's math. I think that's pretty. And I think that it doesn't mean we need to change the issuance schedule, but it does mean that we need more ordinals, like things. We need things that keep block space.
00:20:00.240 - 00:20:02.052, Speaker A: Rivalrous, for sure.
00:20:02.228 - 00:20:03.104, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:20:04.084 - 00:20:32.680, Speaker E: Jumping back just a bit to the economic layer idea. I really like this idea. What did you say? There's a spectrum essentially for any given layer on the economic value that they provide to bitcoin. Zero one directly, you mentioned directly contributing to minor fees. If you're like, as a roll up if you're storing data on bitcoin. L. One.
00:20:32.680 - 00:20:45.444, Speaker E: I mean, that's ob. Obviously a win if you are maybe, like, uh, facilitating layer one transactions in some. Some. Some fashion. Um, and then you mentioned, like, 30, 40 year staking.
00:20:46.184 - 00:21:04.322, Speaker A: Well, yeah, sorry. I went everywhere. Let me get really tighter. So, for, like, the. For the economic layer, what I'm trying to say is, like, if you wanted to qualify for this, and, like, look, I don't have, like, a bitcoin layers thing I'm launching or anything, so I'm not. I'm not bitcoin scene. I don't get to announce my editorial policy to everyone.
00:21:04.322 - 00:21:28.394, Speaker A: Like, he's like, yeah, sure. But, like, if I were, what I would say is, like, I want to see economic alignment out of these projects. So what that, to me, means is you are using bitcoin as your base asset. You are contributing to bitcoins economic security. So that could be through straight up merge mining. That could be through burning. That could be through, like, long time locking up bitcoin for future miners.
00:21:28.394 - 00:21:53.584, Speaker A: I think all of those are interesting options. And then the other one for me is like, yeah, bitcoin holders need to make money on this thing. Not just, like, in general, because, like, number go up, but specifically, where is value accruing if some of the value is not accruing to bitcoin holders, you messed up. Like, if it's accruing to just a bunch of people you airdropped hoping to, and that's it. You probably aren't aligned enough.
00:21:53.884 - 00:21:54.704, Speaker C: Yep.
00:21:55.784 - 00:21:57.568, Speaker E: I just really like this reframing.
00:21:57.616 - 00:21:58.160, Speaker A: I don't.
00:21:58.272 - 00:22:19.800, Speaker E: I don't think in the LT space, like, people don't talk about economic layers. They don't talk about economic incentives. It's actually a pretty refreshing take for me. Having explored the large majority of layers on bitcoin, it feels nice to frame it in a new way. And this feels, like, appropriate to me.
00:22:19.952 - 00:23:05.554, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, another way to look at it is technical alignment, and that's the route we've been stuck in for the past, like, six or seven years now. And that's not like a slide on lightning at all, because I'm a huge fan of the work that all the teams there have done. It's just like, that is one of the most difficult ways to solve some of these problems is this channel based, basically state layer. And so we just need better words than whether or not something is an l two and whether or not you have unilateral exit. Both of those things, they don't really add a lot to the conversation. Now, are a bunch of ETH holders making money because of your bitcoin? L two, that I think is a really interesting discussion to have.
00:23:08.294 - 00:23:14.114, Speaker E: Just really quick, what if we take lightning? What are the economic benefits?
00:23:16.474 - 00:23:51.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll be, like, a lightning apologist and, like, not. So I'll try to take both sides of this. And I'm not telling you where I am. I'm just telling you what I've heard over the years. What I've heard is, I've heard that, look, lightning, like settlement transactions, are long term going to continue to contribute economically to bitcoin security because people have settled, yada, yada, yada. And what I just saw was, well, block space was congested, and it made lightning a lot harder to use. The other thing that we learned about lightning is that in the high fiat environment, it's probably not acceptable for non custodial onboarding of new users.
00:23:51.630 - 00:24:13.922, Speaker A: Custodial is fine. We've seen it have product market fit, but we haven't seen it. So, like, if we wanted 8 billion people tomorrow, if we had bitcoin, we could airdrop to all of them. Like, cool, you've got bitcoin now we're like Roger verb before his turning, before the great. We're just out there giving money away to people. We can't do that. Lightning, it doesn't work.
00:24:13.922 - 00:24:43.994, Speaker A: And I'm not saying that these other supposed alt two s necessarily can, but it's just a different approach. So, yeah, so I don't know if lightning will long term be really good for the economic security of bitcoin. But I do know that if the fee market does really well, lightning struggles to onboard new users. And so that's kind of unfortunate. And a good person who would come in here and would argue about, like, channel factories and stuff, but I'm not educated enough to be that person's son.
00:24:44.614 - 00:24:45.246, Speaker E: Interesting.
00:24:45.310 - 00:24:45.486, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:45.510 - 00:24:46.234, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:24:47.214 - 00:25:34.714, Speaker B: Interesting. I want to double click on this, like, passing fees down from an l two to zero one, because people will use terms like bribing, which I don't fully know what people mean by that, but there's, like, two pieces, there's passing fees down to the miners, and then there's accruing value to the holders, and there's different, like, merge mining passes them down and then liquid as a federation just holds them and they stop there. And so I could see, like, if Solana worked perfectly and the bridge was relatively trustless, I could see Solana being a pretty huge value add, even though it breaks the passing fees down model so that one feels more important than the other. But. Well, curious about that, any of you guys.
00:25:36.894 - 00:25:41.514, Speaker A: I mean, I think if anything pays its tithe back to daddy bitcoin. Cool.
00:25:42.214 - 00:25:43.394, Speaker E: It's funny because.
00:25:45.934 - 00:26:20.786, Speaker C: It's funny just because that brings up, like, the joke that, like, that the ETH folks have, which is Solanas and ETH l two, and which is now inverted where Solana saying, well, maybe ETH, maybe some of your l two s will become our Eldus. Whatever I do, I'll just. Yeah, I'll reiterate what Bob said. I like this I. This different framing of it. Layer two has always been a very failing term, but it's very easy to talk about because everybody knows what you mean. But I think the definitions, there are some teams out there even try to work on strong definitions of l two s.
00:26:20.786 - 00:26:27.716, Speaker C: It doesn't really work very well. Yeah, I like this idea.
00:26:27.740 - 00:26:28.244, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:26:28.324 - 00:26:32.388, Speaker C: Does Solana, does cancel out pay bitcoin base layer fees?
00:26:32.476 - 00:26:33.116, Speaker A: Possibly.
00:26:33.180 - 00:26:34.824, Speaker C: There's probably a way to do it.
00:26:36.084 - 00:27:11.530, Speaker E: Yeah, there are some complications if you're bridging to Solana, like, you have to pay Seoul as your gas token. That's not great for the bitcoin economic thesis. How are you actually facilitating any bitcoin transactions at all other than bridging, which is probably, you know, doesn't really qualify there. So then when are people making bitcoin transactions? Like, where are the bitcoiners actually winning? I mean, it's hard to draw that picture in the straight. Just bridge to Solana. Now interact on Solana. If it's not rolling up of some kind, back to back to the bitcoin l one or paying fees or, I don't know, doing more bitcoin stuff.
00:27:11.530 - 00:27:21.340, Speaker E: I think I'm going to have to go back through all of the bitcoin l two s and then layers and do this economic incentive. Uh, have, have you done any of this work, Matt?
00:27:21.412 - 00:27:22.020, Speaker D: Like, I.
00:27:22.092 - 00:27:30.596, Speaker A: Of course, yeah. I can't. I can't. I feel bad because I don't want to. Like, I can't speak for all these other teams. And things changed. Most of it's not live and yada, yada, yada.
00:27:30.596 - 00:28:16.144, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, a little bit of the work that I've done. So, like, Solana, imagine, imagine that some of its emissions, like native emissions, just like, bought and burned bitcoin. Suddenly Solana is like a tithe paying, I don't know, economic layer, if not null two. And I mean, yeah, and then you look at some of. And I'm going to stop naming names because it feels too petty. But you look at some of these Altus, and it's like, are your fees going to ethereum? Which is, which has been a common candidate? So, like, they're saying, well, this is like a bitcoin l two. But then if you dig, it's like, where are the fees actually going? I think that's probably something that I personally want to avoid.
00:28:16.144 - 00:28:51.746, Speaker A: But another really interesting take is Babylon. What Babylon is trying to do right now is get cosmos chains to use bitcoin to basically do timestamping and to solve certain long range attacks and other issues with their proof of stake. I actually thought, there's no way in hell a chain team say yes to that. Because why? You're kind of giving up part of your sovereignty. Actually, it turns out some of them will, and they only will because it's bitcoin. If they were doing that for ETH or for soul or something else, there's no way. But for bitcoin, they're like, well, it's bitcoin.
00:28:51.746 - 00:29:13.330, Speaker A: It's the one thing that keeps running. And I think that's the most important part about the bitcoin network, is that it gives us that economic certainty this thing will keep running. And so I was actually shocked to hear I won't out the cosmos chains, but I think they'll out themselves soon, that they actually want bitcoin supporting their security. Preston. Yeah.
00:29:13.362 - 00:29:26.034, Speaker D: Cool. Can I ask another dumb question? Probably are actually dumb questions. Got to be someone dumb watching, too, right? So when we talk about network, like, bribing the miners, isn't that what every transaction is? There's two parts to this?
00:29:26.114 - 00:29:26.466, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:26.530 - 00:29:29.014, Speaker D: That. Are they all bribes then?
00:29:29.614 - 00:29:30.702, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. Yeah.
00:29:30.718 - 00:29:31.630, Speaker E: I mean, I think it's the whole.
00:29:31.662 - 00:30:01.890, Speaker A: Discussion about what is Mev and what is, like, the. What's the game design, like, working as it's intended. Right? So, like, here's, like, a really clear example. Binance lost, I don't remember the date, but they lost a bunch of bitcoin. And there was a proposition that maybe they would bribe the miners to reorg. So that's clearly a bribe, right? That is a please go treat this other chain as your tip and mine off that, and we'll pay you so much that the hack didn't happen. We fixed the hack.
00:30:01.890 - 00:30:42.370, Speaker A: And so I think a lot of us would say, like, we don't want that behavior. Like, we want that to happen as infrequently as possible. Right? So every transaction at some size can be mev and can be a bribe. And obviously, bribe is just like, that's like, just like a slur for just, like, paying miners to do a thing. It's just like, is it paying miners to do the thing we all expect them to do? Or is it paying miners to kind of, like, work outside the system? And so, like, take it a step further. Hey, mine on this chain to keep because this is where my stablecoin will have value. Or mine on this chain because I want to get in this nft mint or mine.
00:30:42.370 - 00:31:03.624, Speaker A: So I think that's where it starts to become kind of dangerous. And I think a lot of people in the bitcoin space, like, I just saw this term, like, in evil. Like, instead of Mev, it's like evil Mev. And, I mean, we learned. Yeah, it's good. It gets catchy, even though I can't say it out loud, I guess. But, yeah, we've learned from a lot of other chains what mev can and can't do.
00:31:03.624 - 00:31:10.624, Speaker A: But in bitcoin's case, if people have really start orphaning blocks, it's bad.
00:31:10.964 - 00:31:38.020, Speaker D: And the question one b, then is, what is the intent? What should be happening? Is what should be happening just what can happen? Because that's sort of what, like, bitcoin's nature is bitcoin's nature to accept the largest bidders doing and not really tell us what's good and bad about it. Is it, like, even a rational conversation for us to have about what it should be? Or should we be helping it be what it becomes, whatever that is?
00:31:38.212 - 00:31:45.348, Speaker A: What do you guys think? What are you on the filter debate? I have a feeling I know where you land, but just to filter, I.
00:31:45.356 - 00:31:55.814, Speaker E: Don'T know, just to really quickly quote Donnie here, bitcoin is not the arbiter of justice. It is the facilitator of reality. That quote will go down.
00:31:55.854 - 00:31:58.766, Speaker A: That's. That's like, that's fire. That is fire.
00:31:58.870 - 00:32:17.482, Speaker C: Like, that's. That's the. That's the new maxi line. And I, you know, recapture this term because it's like the. The new, like, hardcore bitcoiners are, like, more aggressively advocating for bitcoins, permissionless than the old guard. It's kind of wild.
00:32:17.618 - 00:32:48.254, Speaker A: So look, to be clear, I'm on the no filters. Fuck off. If I can pay for block space, I will, et cetera. I'm just looking long term, and I'm like, okay, just imagine a world where, like, the largest major exchange chooses which of these forks. And now in the world that I would hope, I would hope they try to do that. And the rest of us are like, absolutely not. And we choose, and we choose the other, the other chain.
00:32:48.254 - 00:32:55.838, Speaker A: So that would be my hope. But when it happens in little ways, that's where it's hard, because there's not a big moment where we can all socially come together and say no.
00:32:55.926 - 00:32:56.554, Speaker E: So.
00:32:56.974 - 00:32:58.206, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry, go ahead, Charlie.
00:32:58.270 - 00:33:39.934, Speaker C: Oh, Matt. This gets right at the heart of, like, a lot of the software conversation right now, because a lot of the urgency behind, say, the op check template verify people, or the Opcat folks is saying right now, if everyone, to avoid us having to use custodians for bitcoin, we have to do something different with bitcoin. And so this. Yeah. The way you reduce the power these centralized exchanges have in the future is by not ossifying today, because if we ossify today, bitcoin goes into the hands of the coin bases and the blackrocks of the world.
00:33:40.774 - 00:33:55.462, Speaker A: The flip side is, if we don't ossify, bitcoin also goes into the hands of the coinbases. And so, yeah, super sympathetic to your point. I just think that both are dangerous because, like, how do we. How do we have a system that's changing, that's not captured, as Paul Madib.
00:33:55.518 - 00:33:58.046, Speaker C: Says, they're the narrow tap neet C wave.
00:33:58.110 - 00:33:59.954, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly.
00:34:00.414 - 00:34:18.580, Speaker D: My argument, again, probably uneducated against that it would be possible or frugal or even attractive for binance to decide to, like, not 51% of time, but, like, you know, if you have enough money to move the system, the system becomes yours, and thereby the system is valueless. The system becomes binance.
00:34:18.732 - 00:34:19.364, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:34:19.444 - 00:34:36.752, Speaker D: So, like, it's sort of, it always has seemed to me in the back of my head, maybe I'm just, like, an optimist in terms of, like, bitcoin's ability to just shrug off whatever, anything might throw at it. But, like, if I had enough money to 51% attack bitcoin, I wouldn't waste that money attacking something that I'm going to devalue by attacking it.
00:34:36.848 - 00:34:40.464, Speaker A: So, like, it sounds good because you're a long term thinker, but.
00:34:40.544 - 00:34:41.176, Speaker D: But it's not that way.
00:34:41.200 - 00:35:11.774, Speaker A: CZ actually tried to do this. Like, this was on the table, and he was trying to figure it out after this hack like this, this happened. And it's like, you know, if this whole, if bitcoin survives because we're all low ego, bitcoin's not going to survive. Like, that's not, that's not you know what I mean? So, like, you, Donnie, are clearly, like, a modest person. And I'm, like, listening to you, I'm like. You're, like, dropping fire quotes, and you're like, well, this is an educated butt. Here's this complete fire, right? So, like, you know, yeah, if we add more donnies, I agree.
00:35:11.774 - 00:35:57.094, Speaker A: But, like. And I don't know, CZ, so I'm not even trying to make an attack on his character. It's just like, we're talking about billions of dollars and that power being really concentrated by this exchanges and now by the ETF. And so I think, yeah, Charlie, I think your point is topical with tune, but also really good, because it's like, if Dev becomes so active that you can make a change and it hits the network in the same sort of timeframe, that ethereum or something like cCash changes, it's not going to be good. We really need a slow path. And for me, if I see soft forks start landing, and it doesn't take two years to get consensus, I might be out, or at least, I don't know. I gotta figure out something to do with my life because.
00:35:59.194 - 00:35:59.890, Speaker E: It gets into.
00:35:59.922 - 00:36:06.174, Speaker A: Like, the fed territory. Like, who made this decision? Where were they? Were they in New York? Was there an agreement?
00:36:07.954 - 00:36:26.342, Speaker E: One other filters take for you, Matt, is a lot more products are coming out like slipstream, uh, where they accept non standard transactions. Is there a path in the future where standardness rules become eliminated and you just have consensus rules?
00:36:26.478 - 00:36:44.562, Speaker A: I think standardist rules are silly. I I. For me, I think they're silly. I don't. I don't. I think as someone who tries to build interesting things on bitcoin, I'm constantly running up against this, and it's like, uh, you know, uh, if. If it's important to you, make it part of consensus, and if it's not, don't.
00:36:44.562 - 00:36:50.906, Speaker A: So I think that they're like a social flex, and I don't, like, yeah, high stakes.
00:36:51.010 - 00:36:57.922, Speaker B: It should be, like, on the node level, if you're running a raspberry PI. Yeah, you can check that box so your bent pool doesn't crash, but otherwise just go.
00:36:57.978 - 00:36:59.934, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah.
00:37:01.434 - 00:37:15.152, Speaker B: Okay. I want to take a hard left turn. We just spent 40 minutes deep diving. This was fantastic. You can't find these conversations anywhere else. Donnie, you got your flowers as the resident philosopher king, so, hell, yeah. But now.
00:37:15.152 - 00:37:50.946, Speaker B: So this was like, this was midwit to the right curver conversation the past 40 minutes. Now we're going to go the opposite side and go full degen and talk about runes and uncommon goods. And I'll give the preface I can and then you guys can fill me in. But as far as I know, the first rune to be etched is going to be called uncommon goods. It's going to start at the halving when runes goes live and go to the next halving as an uncapped supply. And so this kind of a game theory of like the cost of an uncommon good is the cost of a transaction at some level. That's really all I know.
00:37:50.946 - 00:37:55.574, Speaker B: I don't know anything else about this except for like, you know, hearing a little bit about Casey and spaces.
00:37:56.074 - 00:38:01.454, Speaker D: You can etch the one per block, correct. And it's non fungible.
00:38:01.914 - 00:38:03.266, Speaker B: One per transaction, right?
00:38:03.330 - 00:38:06.974, Speaker D: No, I'm pretty sorry. One per transaction? Is that what it is? One per transaction.
00:38:07.014 - 00:38:12.754, Speaker A: And you're not. I thought it was one per block, but I read it about it last night, so I'm not the best person.
00:38:13.534 - 00:38:19.074, Speaker E: I think you can mint, not etch. Etch is like deploy.
00:38:19.374 - 00:38:20.314, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
00:38:21.254 - 00:38:26.766, Speaker E: And then minting with runes. Every runes transaction.
00:38:26.950 - 00:38:27.334, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:38:27.374 - 00:38:43.054, Speaker E: Every runes action, whether it's etching a token or minting a token, is one to one tied to a bitcoin transaction. So you can do multiple mints for a rune in the same transaction. You can do as many bitcoin transactions as you want in the same block. That's okay.
00:38:44.394 - 00:39:04.174, Speaker C: It's one per transaction. And he hasn't etched or deployed the rune yet. But he says that it's going to be hard coded. Maybe it is hard coded already. I actually bare it is a single. Yeah, it's a single uncommon good ticker dollar ug, we assume?
00:39:05.674 - 00:39:06.034, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:06.074 - 00:39:32.514, Speaker E: So it's not divisible. You can essentially mint one uncommon good rune token every bitcoin transaction. And it is hard coded already. You can see that there's the block start and there's the block end. It does have a max, but the max is two to the 128th, which is the theoretical maximum for all. All tokens. And it's just in there because it has to be in there, I guess.
00:39:32.974 - 00:39:36.238, Speaker D: The universe, something like that. It's like the same number, isn't it?
00:39:36.326 - 00:39:55.734, Speaker E: Yeah. People estimated total supply just based on how big a runes transaction is. And I think it's around, what, 20 billion. It's like two to 20 billion total supply. If all bitcoin transactions just minted Ug token for the next four years. So supply is going to be less than that.
00:39:56.154 - 00:40:18.934, Speaker B: Yeah. So what do you think is going to happen then? Because something we talked about with BSA twenties is that race to the finish was very enticing for Djens. Once you cross like 50% minted, it's like a race to close it out. Hopefully price goes up. Obviously, as we said in the previous episode, BRC Twenty's easy to deploy, easy to mint. Hella hard to transfer, good for number go up.
00:40:19.974 - 00:40:20.622, Speaker E: But what do we think?
00:40:20.638 - 00:40:31.074, Speaker B: What do we think is going to happen with like a four year supply of just like, it's a box and DJ at the beginning, lol in the middle, DJ at the end? Like, what's, what's the play here?
00:40:31.534 - 00:41:57.754, Speaker C: Okay, out the gate, who knows? It's clearly driven by mania and speculation. I'm most interested in what happens a year into this because in such a scenario, it's the dominant rune. I don't see that it ever becomes like, not in the pantheon of runes tickers. Is that just a scenario? What's like, how many bytes does it take to how many bytes or weight units of block space will that take off? Theoretically, any economically rational bitcoin participant would mint runes by default with a bitcoin transaction. Every transaction they broadcast, when the fee rate makes sense, based upon the sale price that run and the fee rate times bites, they take it up to include that optional up return. So this actually creates a really interesting, like, side market v market to regular bitcoin transactions, which we could see, I like to speculate, but we could see this become a driving force of how wallets even calculate fees, or even how wallets a year or two from now even like make like fee rate estimation logic. This is something which is a very simple, dumb idea which could really impact the incentives on bitcoin.
00:41:57.754 - 00:41:59.754, Speaker C: It blows my mind.
00:42:00.494 - 00:42:34.086, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it kind of has the same problem, but I'm figuring out the mechanism. So just, y'all tell me if this is done. But it reminds me of people who say, yeah, bitcoin is the price of the electricity that generated it. That's obviously not true, right? To that person who generated it. There was a floor. We know that they thought it was at least worth it to yada, yada, yada, but it's a price point, but it doesn't have long term staying power necessarily. And so I wonder if that's like.
00:42:34.086 - 00:42:45.134, Speaker A: I guess what I'm getting at is if people keep using uncommon goods and there continues to be interest, it would make sense that it would be kind of like an oracle for price. Yeah, if they keep using it.
00:42:45.174 - 00:43:01.724, Speaker C: It's like how miners have demand response strategies based upon the variable price of their power versus the price of bitcoin. We could see basically block space demand response in the terms of uncommon goods being minted. Crazy.
00:43:04.864 - 00:43:06.128, Speaker D: Sorry, go ahead, buck.
00:43:06.296 - 00:43:26.576, Speaker E: No, I was just going to say I don't see any, like, near term strategy for uncommon goods, other than I've seen whispers of people doing, like, the first 10,000 uncommon goods minted as part of like, a ten k collection of sorts. So there is some hype there where people are speculating as people do.
00:43:26.600 - 00:43:27.008, Speaker D: Like who.
00:43:27.056 - 00:44:23.370, Speaker E: Who wouldn't want to own one of the first 10,000 of the very first hard coded rune token that, you know, assuming in four years that we're all still here, you know, doing this show once a week, and ordinals are a thing and, and. And runes are still a thing. I mean, uncommon goods will be like the ultimate OG runs token massive supply. If you were here early, you could get it for free, almost. So I don't know, there is some, like, first ten k speculation happening and people will probably go for it, especially because I don't think you can mint a rune before it is etched and you have to etch it in the block. And so, although I guess if you etch it in the block, then you can mint it in that block, because as long as your fear is lower than the etching, then I. I think you can.
00:44:23.370 - 00:44:27.442, Speaker E: So, yeah, you could etch or mint any kind of token in the first block.
00:44:27.498 - 00:44:45.934, Speaker A: So, yeah, so here's my question to bring all this conversation back. One who do you think is going to buy the first block and just fill it with uncommon goods? Like, who is going to buy an entire block, fill the entire thing as a marketing stunt and then hold all of them and assume that that drives it to the moon.
00:44:49.014 - 00:44:53.390, Speaker C: My bad. Is nobody. Yeah.
00:44:53.542 - 00:45:10.934, Speaker D: Be very expensive to do that. It'd be very expensive. And this is that kamikaze pilot theory we were just talking about earlier. Who has enough money that they want to potentially devalue the entire experience by spending all that money to control the experience? Because then it kind of isn't what it was supposed to be to begin with. Doesn't mean someone won't do it, though, right?
00:45:11.094 - 00:45:32.982, Speaker A: The flip side, though, is people post stunts like this at other chains, that it cost millions, millions of dollars because the stunt is such good marketing. It's a global consensus mechanism. So everyone using the chain is suddenly impacted. Right. And so it's like, I mean, we used to have people pay to share their engagements in op return. Why not? I mean, yeah, it's expensive. I'm not saying I have the change in my back pocket.
00:45:32.982 - 00:45:34.474, Speaker A: We're just saying it's doable.
00:45:35.174 - 00:46:19.798, Speaker E: There is a reasonable likelihood that there is some conglomerate runes, tooling marketplaces and mining pools. You know, put all of them together, and now you have people that are all incentivized to get a chunk of runes tokens. Imagine that you can not only get a bunch of uncommon goods, but you can also etch the first ten tokens, the first ten runes tokens, the first hundred runes tokens, the first 500 runes tokens, and you could mint a whole bunch within that block, and then you can distribute all of that to the. To the people in your group. I don't know. It seems like there's likely something here.
00:46:19.846 - 00:46:24.774, Speaker A: That could happen if that group doesn't exist. Should we be that group right now?
00:46:24.854 - 00:47:12.122, Speaker D: Right after this, we're going to get on a call and we're going to figure it out. The thing that this brought up in my head, that sort of goes to a different. Did you hear what Johannes did yesterday or two days ago? He's the guy who forked Mempool into Orbull space and allows you to look at ordinals transactions. He set up a protocol where if you make the lock time on a transaction 21, which means that the transaction broadcast wouldn't clear until after block 21, which has already happened, so there's no delay on it. When you do this, it automatically generates a cat whose coloration is determined by the fee structure. There's now this protocol that is, you can basically mint a cat with an unlimited supply. And again, the same dynamics play where there's like there's a first 10,000, there's a first hundred thousand, there's an unlimited supply, potentially.
00:47:12.122 - 00:47:20.354, Speaker D: But every time you're doing anything else, you can set the lock time as 21. It won't change anything about the transaction. You can get yourself cat with the color pertaining to the fee structure.
00:47:20.474 - 00:47:21.254, Speaker E: How are.
00:47:22.354 - 00:47:37.732, Speaker B: One caveat. I thought that it's kind of like what Matt was saying earlier of like you can lock it to 40 years in the future with the lock time of the transaction. I think that 21 is. It's locked for 21 blocks, so it's locked for a few hours, and then you can transfer and spend it the.
00:47:37.748 - 00:47:53.996, Speaker D: Way Johannes said it. And this is, again, I don't know. He said that when you put the lock that's not a lock times the lock block. So anything after the block that is listed there will be sent. So there's never a delay because it's waiting for block 21, which has already happened. That's the way he tripleized it. But maybe there's a language.
00:47:54.060 - 00:48:02.604, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's actually on, it's actually on chain, but it doesnt actually lead to a lockup. Just means your wallets going to be a pain in the ass. A lot of wallets wont help.
00:48:03.024 - 00:48:03.924, Speaker E: Got it.
00:48:04.344 - 00:48:32.592, Speaker D: Following question, what sort of gui changes are we going to see in very common ordinals? Wallets that are going to allow you to mint runes and make cats and do all these other things according to all these new protocols that are coming out on bitcoin, when youre at the end of the transaction or about to broadcast it and youre choosing the fee, is there going to be like mint a cat or mint unconsciously? Is someone just going to be doing this stuff or are they going to do it like. I don't know, it's just, it's exciting.
00:48:32.648 - 00:48:33.480, Speaker E: To see, I think.
00:48:33.512 - 00:48:33.872, Speaker A: Yes.
00:48:33.968 - 00:49:09.664, Speaker E: Why not? Why not? It does increase block space, but if there are economic incentives to tack on additional things, you know, if you're inscribing an ordinal, why not add a little operating mind? Some of the latest Degen reigns, you know, why not add the 21 to your lockup and get some cats? It feels like, especially with meme coin. Meme coins going crazy. Like, why not? As you transact, earn memes the memes of the day. It feels like the perfect, perfect opportunity.
00:49:09.824 - 00:49:15.284, Speaker D: Like candy crust. Yeah, you don't really need a reward. It's just fun. It's the noises make it fun.
00:49:16.264 - 00:49:45.834, Speaker C: Heterogeneity on bitcoin is one of the most fascinating and terrifying things ever. And it's almost, we let the cat out of the bag. We can't put, we can't put the genie back in the bottle. But I think the discussion should be over how much heterogeneity is okay, not is heterogeneity even possible, because we've clearly demonstrated that it is inevitable.
00:49:47.874 - 00:49:49.414, Speaker B: It's a boy. Damn.
00:49:49.954 - 00:49:50.522, Speaker D: Idioms.
00:49:50.578 - 00:49:53.362, Speaker B: So much top to bottom. There's so much lips, so much clip.
00:49:53.418 - 00:49:59.614, Speaker E: You gotta settle down, Charlie. That was, that was a little too fantastic for this group right now.
00:50:00.154 - 00:50:03.814, Speaker A: I was waiting for him to say we're gonna do a little magic. I was just waiting for it.
00:50:06.914 - 00:50:49.144, Speaker B: But on the topic of like, you slap on an operator and get a little bit of extra value in that transaction, that does seem like if you play it out long enough, it does start to hurt fungibility because you have two different assets of flatting value. And so I wonder, currently everyone kind of has your ordinals wallet and it segregates fungible sats with other types. But there's no easy way to uncheck that. That's an advanced feature for users currently. So I assume that the two lenses, ordinals lens, fungible sats lens in the future be like, you click it and it's going to not delete, but it won't recognize your opera, turn rune and just go back to sets. That seems like how it's going to play out.
00:50:49.184 - 00:51:12.526, Speaker E: Well, the nice thing about runes is you can just consolidate. It's not like permanent bloating. Even within the runes protocol. You can have a whole bunch of runes, utxos that you can just smash together. And so then you don't have extra sets sitting around. You just have one Utxo that can manage all of your runes. So that's like the main, you know, runes doesn't bloat.
00:51:12.526 - 00:51:32.594, Speaker E: The Utxo set idea where Brc 20, like ordinals, still recognizes Brc 20 mint inscriptions for all time and eternity. And so it's just going to sit there and you actually have to uncheck, like, I don't care about these things, don't index these things, let me spend these things for them to be able to be like, you know, aggregated and sent out.
00:51:33.014 - 00:51:42.514, Speaker B: All right, that was an hour, guys. I think this is a good time to call it. Fantastic episode. So that's the podcast.
