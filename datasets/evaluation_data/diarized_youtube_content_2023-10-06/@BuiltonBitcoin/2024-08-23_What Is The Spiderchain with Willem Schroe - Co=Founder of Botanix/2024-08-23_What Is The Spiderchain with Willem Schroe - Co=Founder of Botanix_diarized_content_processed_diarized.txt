00:00:00.640 - 00:00:03.201, Speaker A: What is the spider chain?
00:00:03.353 - 00:00:04.417, Speaker B: This is one of those things you.
00:00:04.441 - 00:00:42.359, Speaker A: Might have heard if you've been traversing the new Bitcoin L2 space, and certain names will pop up more consistently than others. And the spider chain, which is something made by Botanix Labs, which is an L2, it's EVM, so it uses the ETH virtual machine. But the spider chain is their way of solving the Pagan process. And so I kept hearing about it, didn't know enough. I had to get on the best person to talk about exactly that, the co founder, Willem Trow. So that's what we're doing. Real quick, though.
00:00:42.359 - 00:01:05.865, Speaker A: Welcome back to Built on Bitcoin. I'm your humble host, Jacob Brown. You know what we do here, we're talking to the best founders in bitcoin. We're creating all the best shit on bitcoin. So as I mentioned, today we have Willem on the show. He's the co founder of Britannics and most of this is about the spider chain. We touch a little bit on his background.
00:01:05.865 - 00:01:07.401, Speaker A: He's a math wizard.
00:01:07.593 - 00:01:09.585, Speaker B: But I was really curious because the.
00:01:09.745 - 00:01:16.089, Speaker A: New L2 space, there's a lot of overlapping designs.
00:01:16.217 - 00:01:17.257, Speaker B: They're very similar.
00:01:17.321 - 00:01:39.373, Speaker A: It's hard to understand where these things are actually different. And Botanics is taking a different design with this thing called the spider chain, which is like a train of decentralized multisigs is one way to think about it. And so we touch really this whole episode on the nuances of how this thing exactly works. So if you're curious about that, this.
00:01:39.389 - 00:01:41.545, Speaker B: Is the perfect episode for you.
00:01:41.885 - 00:01:49.525, Speaker A: So without further ado, let's jump into this conversation with Willem Schro, the co founder of Botanix.
00:01:54.865 - 00:01:57.565, Speaker C: Welcome to Built on Bitcoin.
00:02:11.755 - 00:02:13.747, Speaker B: Willem. How you doing, Jim?
00:02:13.771 - 00:02:17.363, Speaker C: Okay, I'm doing good. How are you? Good to be here.
00:02:17.539 - 00:02:44.675, Speaker B: I am fantastic. Good to have you, man. Good to have you. Yeah, we're just going to jump right in. We're talking L2s, you guys are building one and Bitcoin. But real quick, because I know a little bit about you, but not a ton. It sounds like you have a background in commodities and kind of like the energy space maybe, and then you have a strong cryptography background, but now you're in bitcoin.
00:02:44.675 - 00:02:49.935, Speaker B: So give me the 62nd TRDR of what you did in the past life and how you end up on bitcoin.
00:02:50.835 - 00:03:26.147, Speaker C: No, it sounds perfect. I grew up in Belgium, so Belgium for most of my life actually. There's a lot of big cryptographers actually in Belgium and in Bitcoin as well. Then became 13 national championship in mathematics. So I was good in mathematics, then ended up doing electrical engineering, then started researching in cryptography. So I researched in authenticated encryption. It's basically the cryptography where you want to bring together both authentication and encryption in one single algorithm, which is extremely hard by the way.
00:03:26.147 - 00:04:06.855, Speaker C: So research in that broke some algorithms in there. Actually saw Bitcoin in my cryptography classes already there. Then ended up working in chemicals. So something totally different that brought me to Saudi Arabia. So I lived two years in Saudi, then went to Harvard in Boston and then to New York. And yeah, basically saw Bitcoin in my cryptography classes, only put together later the bigger macro picture. And basically two years ago came up with the idea for Botanics which is like I think one of the first two actually of the Bitcoin L2 is before and there was like the hundreds of them and the theory there is like still exactly the same.
00:04:06.855 - 00:04:34.845, Speaker C: I think bitcoin is a winning money and I think the EVM is a winning virtual machine. And then yeah, I wanted to build a layer 2 EVM on Bitcoin first. Actually started off wanting to build roll ups on Bitcoin, realized different downsides that come along with roll ups and so went deep into the cryptography. I love decentralization. I'm a decentralization maxi and so design what's now called the spider chain.
00:04:35.465 - 00:05:09.465, Speaker B: Very cool, very cool. Actually, I would love to get definition real quick because I've been pushing on people to define decentralization and it seems like the community at large, especially the average kind of like defi user which will often comment on these things, they seem to conflate decentralization and trustlessness as like one and the same. And I'm trying to parse where those things start and stop. It seems like they do overlap at some level. But like how do you define decentralization? And like maybe if it helps to bracket against trustlessness.
00:05:09.965 - 00:05:59.125, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. A lot of people call. I mean it comes from defi, right? And it's decentralized finance, but in reality it's not decentralized, it's trustless. Basically, if you have an immutable smart contract that's not really decentralized, it's a fully trustless smart contract really because you cannot change the code there. And so yeah, where I put the decentralization is if a single party and I often think about governments because that's where we need to protect ourselves from like longer term. What if a Government subpoena a certain company, what can they achieve? And if the protocol is not able to protect the themselves against it, I would call it quite centralized. And so there is quite a big spectrum I think in terms of what you would need for certain applications.
00:05:59.125 - 00:06:40.603, Speaker C: I think if you want to be the best money out there for the next thousands of years, you need to be extremely decentralized. Which brings you to Bitcoin. Extremely decentralized. Now if you want to go beyond that and basically maybe make like an NFT marketplace, how decentralized does that actually have to be? Right. And so you suddenly come into this in this spectrum. I think why I'm building the spire chain for example is because I believe the financial system that we're building like with Defi and that you've seen already the primitives on Ethereum, I think that needs to be decentralized. I think the financial system cannot run on a central roll up.
00:06:40.603 - 00:07:10.675, Speaker C: You don't want one country in the world to basically rule the financial system. Ideally this is open, permissionless for anyone in the world. And so that means you need to have at least a few thousand nodes that basically control the whole system. And you cannot have like 10 or 5 or even 15. And that's a little bit what, yeah, what goes into like very centralized or like very decentralized and different applications will need different level of decentralization.
00:07:11.455 - 00:07:40.893, Speaker B: That's helpful. So yeah, just to quickly like make sure that mental models are magic here for people. It sounds like the way to think about trustlessness is kind of a pass fail. It's a yes or no or a Boolean in programming. So it's either trustless or it's not. Decentralization though is there's no central point of failure, no central point of entity, of control, but it's a spectrum. And so 10 people kind of decentralized a thousand much more.
00:07:40.893 - 00:07:56.745, Speaker B: But I think people also get messed up is that if something has 10x the people that are contributing, is it 10x more secure? It kind of has like a fall off is what seems to be implied. So I want to make sure like does that track correctly?
00:07:57.085 - 00:07:59.053, Speaker C: Correct. Correct. Exactly. Yeah.
00:07:59.149 - 00:08:27.095, Speaker B: Okay, cool, sounds good. That I think we can, we can go deeper. And so two years ago you're, you have this idea and back then there was no L2 season yet like Bitcoin, L2s, there was only a few of them. It definitely wasn't cool to build here yet. Like L1 and Lightning were still like the darlings. And so yeah, talk to me about like the initial idea to build a scaling solution and like what you saw as gaps in the market?
00:08:27.595 - 00:09:10.825, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I basically I'm a big bitcoiner. I believe this world absolutely needs Bitcoin. And I saw it, the whole crypto industry and I. What I saw happening very interestingly is I saw a lot of applications reach product market fit. Actually, I still remember Michael Saylor at some point said that what made him realize that Bitcoin is not going away is because once it's reached like $100 billion market cap, he said there's not a single asset or company in the world that went beyond $100 billion and then went back to zero. And so I saw the same thing happening with the applications outside of Bitcoin. You add a lot of different applications, a lot of those rich product market fit.
00:09:10.825 - 00:09:46.157, Speaker C: I mean there's billions of dollars of applications that have been made that have survived multiple cycles. They're still there, people are still using it. It solves an actual use case in the world. And so I saw that, but they were not built on Bitcoin. And I was like, okay, how does that make sense and can we actually do that on Bitcoin? And I started seeing a difference between Ethereum the asset and the evm. The virtual machine basically realized the EVM as virtual machine is what powers all these applications, not Ethereum the asset. And so you can basically bring the EVM to Bitcoin.
00:09:46.157 - 00:10:19.967, Speaker C: And that's what I realized. And so that's what I wanted to do. It's like, okay, but how? Then you come into the next question, of course, how the hell do you bring in EVM to Bitcoin? And can Bitcoin be the native currency on the evm? Now of course we already saw Binance, Chain Avalanche and a few others use actually or even Optimism use different tokens as a native asset of the evm. So I realized you can use Bitcoin as the native asset on the evm. So I want to bring EVM to Bitcoin. EVM is account model. Bitcoin is UTXO model.
00:10:19.967 - 00:11:01.965, Speaker C: Makes things very, very hard because you cannot immediately map from UTEX or to account model in the other way around. And so I tried to figure out how to actually do this. And of course the most obvious solution is like roll ups on Ethereum. And at that moment more and more people were thinking about, can we do roll ups on Bitcoin? I think that's still, still fully unclear. I don't know exactly how we're doing it. It's like this mixes with like a bit vm, which is like a hybrid between like an optimistic roll up with some like if you then put in a ZK verifier. So you have like a mix of different trust assumptions, quite different models than what you have on Ethereum.
00:11:01.965 - 00:11:32.025, Speaker C: But yeah, basically wants to bring the EVM to Bitcoin in very short answer. Basically, I realized someone told me today what we're trying to do is the opposite of wrapped bitcoin. So wrap bitcoin broad Bitcoin as an asset to the new tech, right? And the new tech is like the EVM virtual machine, smart contract applications. What we're trying to do is the opposite. We're bringing the tech, the virtual machines, the EVM to the bitcoin, the asset. And I think that's way more valuable.
00:11:32.645 - 00:11:58.357, Speaker B: I love it. I love it. It's also, it's striking that especially back in 2022 when you started and I've been here since 2021, so I'm a newish bitcoiner. But the dominant narrative was like bitcoin, not crypto, time chain, not blockchain, all these things. And they were trying to artificially make them clearly separate. And a big one too was EVM is eth. They just are the same thing.
00:11:58.357 - 00:12:24.515, Speaker B: And so your kind of awareness to be able to not throw the baby out with the bathwater, be like these things are useful. Even though they are just trading poop coins most of the time, they don't have that much utility. The fundamental structure of it can be very useful, which I think it's the dominant narrative now or quickly becoming that is like DeFi. And bitcoin is going to be absolutely huge. But it was contrarian for a long time.
00:12:24.675 - 00:13:02.561, Speaker C: It was very contrary. No, believe me, I was right there. It was actually because I was at Harvard and I was the only bitcoiner there and I was trying to convince everyone that bitcoin was the only thing that had value. And everyone else was trying to convince me that all the rest had value, but bitcoin didn't. And I was like, wait, let me actually sit down with them and see what value do you see? And actually they kind of convinced me, okay, this actually has potential, this actually has future benefit. And so you had these two camps that were like fully separate. And maybe as funny history turns out, maybe the right answer was like right in the middle.
00:13:02.561 - 00:13:04.417, Speaker C: That was the gap in the market.
00:13:04.481 - 00:13:22.791, Speaker B: Basically deep dive into what you guys are actually building. And I want to bracket, we're going to talk a lot about the spider chain. So people listening latch onto that word. We're going to deep dive into why that's so important here soon. But first, give us the high level of what is Botanix as a company?
00:13:22.823 - 00:13:43.775, Speaker C: So Botanics Labs is actually the company. The spiral chain is a technology that we're doing. And yeah, we're basically a L2 EVM fully running on Bitcoin. So we're not connected to any other chains. Everything runs on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a native currency. Gas fees are in Bitcoin, which will bring you Bitcoin yield.
00:13:43.775 - 00:13:48.215, Speaker C: And we're hoping to bring all the applications of Ethereum back to Bitcoin.
00:13:48.675 - 00:13:57.787, Speaker B: There you go. Okay. And maybe, maybe first point to get clarity on L2 running on Bitcoin and L2 is a buzzword that don't people.
00:13:57.811 - 00:13:58.699, Speaker A: Want to fight over.
00:13:58.827 - 00:14:12.645, Speaker B: We'll just assume it extends Bitcoin in some way. But when you say running on Bitcoin versus if you look at Rootstock, there's some similarities there. It's EVM, it's Merge Mind. So when you say L2 running on Bitcoin, clarify a little bit.
00:14:13.505 - 00:14:41.505, Speaker C: Yeah, depends on how deep you want to go into technology. And naming. What I mean by that is that we don't have any other asset in the whole technology stack. I don't think we need another asset in there. I think Bitcoin is the, the Bristein asset is the best asset we can leverage, the proof of work. So, yeah, we were not connected to or dependent on any other chain in that sense. Like we don't have any risk if any other chain would go down, for example.
00:14:41.625 - 00:15:08.133, Speaker B: And then. So, yeah, the big innovation we want to touch on is the spider chain. Because for people to think about the two big difficult things in Bitcoin is that you could do a side chain which is like a different environment and maybe it has different consensus mechanism and you can do all kinds of fun stuff over there. But given Bitcoin script, you can't peg trustlessly. You can, you can send it that way. It's totally fine. You could pick a destination.
00:15:08.133 - 00:15:32.311, Speaker B: I just spread it up and you send it off. But getting it back and you controlling those funds has not been possible to date. So there's all kinds of clever designs trying to solve that peg mechanism. So, yeah, I want to make sure that we have this clear. The EVM is the sidechain piece. We can do the execution and all the fun stuff. And the spider chain is this kind of bridge that connects the sidechain if you will.
00:15:32.311 - 00:15:34.195, Speaker B: And the L1, is that correct?
00:15:34.495 - 00:15:59.601, Speaker C: Yeah, correct. So basically, just to clarify, I also think that wall ups are sidechains. They run the same thing as like an evm. They have their batches, they've got their block producers, it's just an, a different trust model. And the spider chain is indeed what we call the two way bridge. Yeah. I actually am very skeptical on trustlessness.
00:15:59.601 - 00:16:18.895, Speaker C: I think that's a goal people want to achieve, but in my mind it's almost impossible from just an information theory standpoint, I think. And we haven't seen it today. I don't think there's anything today that is trustless. Even in theory we don't have it yet.
00:16:19.235 - 00:16:42.215, Speaker B: Okay, that's. We'll definitely touch back on that later because I think it opens up a question too of like trustlessness which typically implies like cryptography based things and just like pure code execution. And then there's this other side of economic security and there's a dance there. But we'll put a pin in that for now. Let's. So we'll assume, you know, and this is what. Go ahead.
00:16:42.715 - 00:16:45.883, Speaker C: Yeah, you want to go jump into the spirit chain, right?
00:16:45.939 - 00:17:19.935, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So, so we're gonna, so we're gonna make sure like the, the main thing on the spiral chain is we're gonna talk about this peg mechanism. We're gonna assume once you can solve for this peg mechanism, there's like a Disneyland place where you can do all kinds of magical stuff and it just works. And so the botanic side of that we're gonna, we have, we have ways to think about that already. So that's cool. The peg piece is the big part that you guys are innovating on and I think my audience has a pretty good pulse on the state of this. So like you have two of two on lightning, your federations.
00:17:19.935 - 00:17:39.235, Speaker B: And then like with stacks coming online now with the sptc there's like these different or tbtc for example, you have these like collateral backed threshold ones. How does the spider chain fit into those current paradigms? And then this kind of give us an overview of what the spire chain is.
00:17:40.175 - 00:18:07.365, Speaker C: Sounds good. So the spire chain is a little bit like a mix of the ones you've mentioned. And consider it more of a mix of the lightning network together with federations. And it's very similar. Like a fediment is also a bunch of different federations where people can launch their own federations. And it's a little bit similar to that. In essence, the spider chain is what we Call this series of decentralized multisigs.
00:18:07.365 - 00:18:44.699, Speaker C: In essence, everything is often a multisig. And so the lightning network is a two out of two multisig. And so very cool. The whole lightning network, when you look from a very high level perspective, is this whole network of 2 out of 2 multisigs between all different people and you call them channels. It's beautiful. And so if you park that idea, but, and think bigger and you want to recreate that whole network of decentralized multisigs, that's what we're trying to do with the spider chain. And how in essence it works is like you create this series of bigger multisigs and anyone will be able to permissionally participate.
00:18:44.699 - 00:19:29.313, Speaker C: That's how you scale to like 10,000 or 100,000 nodes. And so in essence, for example, if you start with one single multisig, you will randomly choose 100 participants out of the 10,000 and they will secure one single multisig. And then you do that again, you create a new one and you again randomly choose 100 participants out of the 10,000 and they will secure multisig two. And then you create a third one and then a fourth one and a fifth one and a sixth one. And you keep creating these like sub federations or decentralized federations. And after a while you have this like whole network of decentralized multisigs where anyone can participate in, where anyone can join and where anyone can fully. Yeah, fully joining the network.
00:19:29.313 - 00:19:33.085, Speaker C: And that's how you create a permissionless decentralized layer tool.
00:19:33.625 - 00:20:05.925, Speaker B: I see. Okay. So to compare it against a federation as we typically understand it, a federation is like, you choose the people that are going to be part of that. And there's like a brand reputation piece there. So like on Liquid is you know, 70 whatever entities and you just know. Okay, because they're big names, we trust them. But I can't go and join it unless I get approved by, you know, the, the entities that choose that in this paradigm, anybody can join as needed and become part of that cider set.
00:20:05.925 - 00:20:08.517, Speaker B: That's, that's one of the big fundamental differences.
00:20:08.701 - 00:20:42.075, Speaker C: Yeah, so maybe let's clarify. Federation, for example, liquid 15 fixed, you cannot join. You can only Trust that these 15 are very well chosen. I think today Liquid is a dynamic federation. So every once in a while someone can leave, someone else can join. It's a dynamic federation. And what the spider chain enables is basically a permissionless protocol where anyone can join in scalable up to like 10,000 or to 100,000.
00:20:43.015 - 00:20:48.639, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. And so anybody running. Go ahead.
00:20:48.807 - 00:20:51.475, Speaker C: It's more a network actually than a federation.
00:20:52.015 - 00:21:02.155, Speaker B: Got it. And every person part of that network is also running a bitcoin node and a botanix node.
00:21:02.495 - 00:21:47.471, Speaker C: Correct. So you will both run, but then next node evm, you run the spider chain basically tracking all of these different or network of multisigs and you run a bitcoin node. So it's a little bit heavier. It's more, more or less hardware requirements like Ethereum, So way more heavier. It's not really designed for every person to run a node in the world, even though you can, but it's more designed like Ethereum where every company in the world can run a node. And then that's how I think, how it should be, basically how I think you scale Bitcoin is Bitcoin on the base layer can be run by every person in the world and that's absolutely needed for a second layer for a financial system. Doesn't make sense that every person in the world needs to run that, but every company in the world can run that.
00:21:47.471 - 00:22:00.195, Speaker C: So we'll be more like an Ethereum where anyone can join. But the hardware requirements and the staking requirements are that high that it's more suited for like institutions and companies in the world to run that.
00:22:00.675 - 00:22:09.015, Speaker B: Okay. And to join the network I run these two nodes and then I'm just locking up BTC or what's that process look like?
00:22:09.395 - 00:22:36.255, Speaker C: Correct. So you will lock up BTC so you signal to the rest of the network, look, I want to join as a full node, as a staker basically. I guess when we haven't mentioned all these 10,000 nodes, you come together in a proof of stake. So each one of those stakes bitcoin and that secures the evm. So if you want to join as a full node, you basically stake Bitcoin and then you get recognized by the rest of the network and you will get accepted.
00:22:37.035 - 00:22:48.495, Speaker B: Okay, and is there a minimum for that? How do you, how do you pick like being eligible to be elected like part of the network?
00:22:48.795 - 00:23:34.575, Speaker C: Yeah, there will be a fixed, a fixed staking amount. What we're playing around with right now is the thinking about five Bitcoin basically that goes into the security model of the spider chain, which is actually quite unique. It operates as an over collateralized bridge, but it's actually under collateralized. You don't need the full collateralization and that's a big breakthrough actually of the spider chain. You don't need more security at stake than what's actually in the bridge, because you split this up into this network of multisigs and that's where you get the multiplicator and the breakthrough of the spire chain. So yeah, right now it would be around like five Bitcoin, which of course is already a big quantity.
00:23:35.195 - 00:23:54.081, Speaker B: Yep, yep. And so it's a proof of stake chain. But when people think about that, they think of tokens, they think of inflation. That's like the benefit. You lock up eth, you get eth. I'm assuming in this case you lock up Bitcoin and you're going to get transaction fees as they pass through the network. Is that the benefit to be a validator?
00:23:54.273 - 00:24:24.075, Speaker C: Correct. You lock up Bitcoin and you get Bitcoin that comes from the gas fees that are in Bitcoin. So it's actually in your mental model. Think about Ethereum on the base layer. I mean, with ultrasound money, theoretically there should be zero inflation and so on Botanics. There's also, of course we cannot create new Bitcoin, so there's zero inflation. But all the transaction fees and the gas fees accrue back to the stakers.
00:24:24.075 - 00:24:29.635, Speaker C: And this can be a lot when you think about Ethereum. I think last year they had $5 billion of gas fees.
00:24:31.295 - 00:24:44.795, Speaker B: Yep, makes sense. And you mentioned earlier something about if there's 100 people who are sampled out of a bigger subset, a thousand or whatever it is, what's the significance of that? Why is that relevant?
00:24:45.545 - 00:25:40.567, Speaker C: Yeah, basically, one single multisig is then randomly a subset of 100 participants out of the 10,000. And so the reason for that is there's multiple reasons for it, but the beauty of it is like you get the scalability. So suddenly now you have this one single multisig, all those hundred participants will basically stake five Bitcoin. So theoretically there is at least 500 Bitcoin at stake, net single multisig. Right. Now, if you create hundreds or thousands of these multisigs, your theoretical collateralization massively goes up because you basically multiply the number of multisticks that you have times the amount of stake in a single multisig. And so that can go way beyond than what's on the spider chain.
00:25:40.567 - 00:26:08.865, Speaker C: So that's a cool thing. The second cool thing is if you randomly choose those hundred, you basically have zero control on who's going to be in that subset. And so trying to attack this network becomes almost impossible. If you have 100,000 nodes, you cannot control in which multisec you will be in. And so the amount of things you can do as a participant is actually very limited. So it protects you massively against attacks.
00:26:10.725 - 00:26:22.745, Speaker B: Excellent, excellent. And is that number. So we're using 100 and 1000 or whatever, but is it some threshold? So it's like 10% of the subset or like how do you guys pick that number?
00:26:24.565 - 00:27:08.887, Speaker C: That's pure theoretical. Basically once you go signing for big multisigs we use Frost. So Frost multisigs. If you go the signing time to sign such a multisig going up exponentially in the sense that if you would have a frost of 1,000 participants that basically takes you, I don't know, probably like a minute or something. If you take 100, that's probably doable in a few seconds. If you take 10,000, I don't know, that becomes extremely, extremely hard to do. So every, the more participants you have, the more constantly you need to gossip all different sub keys to each other through all these participants to get up with the final signing key.
00:27:08.887 - 00:28:00.259, Speaker C: And so 100 is this nice trade off in the middle where you can actually be fast enough, but it's also big enough because if you make it too small you run into like liveness risks. Like what if you make a MultiStick of size 3 for example, and two people are offline than one. And so at a size 100 you can basically have enough people. Or let's maybe think there's a blackout in the world or something, right? Some country gets fully partitioned from the electricity network or even a state or something. Does your network still continue to operate? I mean theoretically. A lot of people actually in the bitcoin space have this golden, golden star of a one out of N assumption, right? Theoretically you can run the spider chain with a one out of n assumption. I mean that's totally possible.
00:28:00.259 - 00:28:24.345, Speaker C: The only problem is if one of your nodes goes down then I mean you no longer have that assumption. And so it's often this trade off between liveness and security when you can of course ignore the liveness part. But yeah, you in reality, I mean you can ignore that in theory in your white paper. You cannot ignore that in reality when you're, when you're building production protocols, right?
00:28:26.245 - 00:28:46.101, Speaker B: How so? You mentioned like the 5 BTC limit and it's open membership, so it can grow over time. How often are these multi cities getting spun up? Like if. Is it like yeah, these are rounds, is it daily? Like how often can the network kind of like evaluate and then grow? Or I can join.
00:28:46.293 - 00:29:23.915, Speaker C: Yeah, initially we were thinking of every 10 minutes. Now there is a lot of interactivity between spinning up a new multisig. And so the thinking right now is basically do that every day or every week. And if you go to every week, that's still extremely secure. What you need to do then is increase the staking size so you have that same balance that is there. If you spin up a new multisig every week, for example, that basically means you'll have to put your staking size to like maybe 20 bitcoin or something.
00:29:24.735 - 00:29:52.713, Speaker B: I see. And is the thinking go ahead? Well, I'm just thinking. I'm thinking in real time, like as a designer of a protocol, the things that you're watching for the amount of BTC potentially locked, which is the incentive to try and game the system and then how decentralized or how much threshold those multi stakes should be. That's the question of how often you guys might think about spinning these up. Right?
00:29:52.849 - 00:30:38.313, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, you want real reliability in the protocol. And if you have every 10 minutes, it basically means every 10 minutes you have to do a signing protocol between these hundred and the more activities each of these, or async activities, as you call it, the more async activities these nodes will have to do, the more risk of them of being stuck somewhere in the protocol. And so you need to like, I mean, servers are not ideal operating system. Things go wrong. You can never predict a lot of different things. And so you need to come up with like, what if you start signing a Frost multisig and in the middle of your signing process you get stuck? Okay, what do you do then? Right.
00:30:38.313 - 00:30:48.845, Speaker C: And so these are the actual realities you have to face when actually building the protocol, which is different from the reality on the white paper.
00:30:49.145 - 00:31:14.525, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. And then this is kind of a left term, but it's cool. Something to touch on when you talk to Shinobi. You mentioned something about generating a random number is actually somewhat difficult in computer science. Like a provably random number. And one of the beauty of the things that you guys are doing is you're leveraging bitcoin in a unique way because it's just this really giant heavy random number generator.
00:31:14.525 - 00:31:21.889, Speaker B: You're using that to pick the subset of the multisig. So explain that a little bit because I found that super interesting.
00:31:22.057 - 00:32:05.065, Speaker C: Yeah. I think there's actually in the spire chain white paper, there's been a few breakthroughs that no one else has come up with. I think this model of splitting this out over a series of multisticks, it's quite new. The second one is indeed this random Number generator and also for like the bitcoin staking, I think before us you just had the stake chain white paper of Robin that no one actually really continued on. So we had that as well. But to focus on the random number generator, a random number is extremely hard to generate. Go talk to anyone who is designing cold wallet or even a hot wallet or like Casa to actually come up with a random number for your private key.
00:32:05.065 - 00:32:53.795, Speaker C: It's not easy. And proof of stake protocols massively use random numbers for a bunch of different things. Basically also to decide who's going to build the next block. In proof of work, that's easy because everyone does it and the one with the biggest amount of luck or most energy basically finds the block the fastest. But in proof of stake protocols you basically decide, okay, now we need a random number and that gun is decide who's going to build the next block. And so random numbers are really hard. And actually in the crypto industry outside of bitcoin, there's been a bunch of different startups, a lot of different companies have found different ways to create this VRFs or verifiable random functions.
00:32:53.795 - 00:33:37.493, Speaker C: Even Chainlink has a big program on that. And we came actually to the realization like if you look at bitcoin, what you do is you spend 10 minutes of energy and all these miners do is they actually flip through random numbers trying to find a random number that fits, that fits the block hash where you enough trailing zeroes. Right. And so you are absolutely sure that the number that comes out of it is a random number that's almost like perfect. And the only thing that a miner can do is what's called a withholding attack. They can choose to say like, oh, this number works, I can get the bitcoin block reward, but I don't like this random number. So that's the only power that they would have.
00:33:37.493 - 00:34:07.235, Speaker C: But beyond that, this number that comes out of the bitcoin block hash is a provable random number and it's probably the best random number in the world. I don't think there's any better random number you can generate and that's not in some type of way gameable. Knowing if you know the hardware, if you know for using the weather or if you're using temperature or any other thing, this is probably one of the most, one of the best random number generators in the world.
00:34:07.575 - 00:34:28.063, Speaker B: I love it. I love it. It's simple when you hear it, but it's so underutilized. I love the elegance of that. Cool. So one other thing on Their decentralized piece because you have a 5 BTC limit currently, which is a pretty big number. You know, it's at current prices like three, four and a thousand maybe.
00:34:28.063 - 00:34:58.097, Speaker B: And so for the normie that's going to be inaccessible. So like it moves into medium sized entities are going to be secure in the network and acting kind of like market makers or something to like a yield on their bitcoin. How do you think about that? And I guess second question is I do see pools being a thing because pools are a big thing on eth like Lido. Do you think we'll see botanics pools pretty early on so that I can you know, put in a thousand bucks and get transaction fees 100%.
00:34:58.161 - 00:35:55.581, Speaker C: I actually think it will probably play out very similar to like Ethereum where you have pools, which means if you as at home as an army, you can join one of these pools, you don't have to run the hardware, the pools will do that and you can get part of the yield. Now you can question how decentralized is that? And I think that's a very fair question. I think for a thing that we want to do a decentralized layer that can run the financial system in the world that's sufficiently decentralized. And so I do think you will see pools and I think that you will see that actually very early on actually we will start with 15 different full nodes. So 15 different sequencers or block producers and most of these are actually going to be pool operators from Ethereum. So very professional organization that know how to do it. And that's basically how we're also in the initial phases are going to scale the network.
00:35:55.581 - 00:36:03.733, Speaker C: And so yeah, you'll have that from the beginning, but I think it's better than having one single node.
00:36:03.909 - 00:36:15.945, Speaker B: Yep, makes sense. Okay, we covered a lot. I think that's a pretty good baseline on Spider Chain. Is there anything that I missed that we should for sure cover on Spider Chain?
00:36:17.035 - 00:36:49.519, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what a lot of people often forget is what we're doing with the spy chain is extremely unique in the world of layer 2s. I don't think there's a single layer 2 that is actually fully aiming to be decentralized. It comes at a cost. Like I do think there's a big world for roll ups that are very centralized and trustless because they can go to 0.1 second block times. We cannot do that. If you want to be decentralized, you need all these nodes to talk to each other, to gossip messages to each other.
00:36:49.519 - 00:37:26.005, Speaker C: You have this peer to peer network that is operating and that comes at a cost of throughput. And so it also has its benefits. But I think people often forget that most of the roll ups we actually see are central databases where you produce hashes on which generate a ZK proof which you can then verify to make it more trustless. But it's a very different, yeah, design spectrum. And I think that's the best way to think about the spider chain. We go for that decentralization while others go for like the high throughput trust lessons.
00:37:26.425 - 00:38:00.185, Speaker B: Okay, I think we can, we can come back up for air then away from spider chain. And you just mentioned something that's interesting because I hang on to words and I'm like, do I grok that? Does that not make sense? You mentioned I don't understand Rolex very well, but you mentioned a centralized sequencer that's trustless. And so the way I hear that is you have like an entity like Coinbase who's sequencing things. But I as an end user can force a transaction in and as long as they're being a good actor it will get included. Is that the way to think about trustless but centralized sequencing?
00:38:01.605 - 00:38:48.035, Speaker C: More so how I think about roll ups is indeed trusted but centralized. In essence, there's a single party that runs the database. Right. Can be coinbase in the example of base actually they run this backend database. People can send in transactions, you update the database or the state machine and then you create ZK proof or you do it optimistically where you push to the base layer and you can have a challenge period. And so basically what that trustless means it's trustless within like not fully trustless because of course you always take trust assumptions. But basically what I mean by more going trustless is that you trust that these people cannot steal.
00:38:48.035 - 00:39:28.659, Speaker C: If they would be able to steal, then you can indeed like submit a challenge on the base protocol and you can, yeah, you can enforce that they cannot steal from you another way. I think what you were more referring to is the censorship resistance. And so one unfortunate thing of centralized operators is they're not censorship resistant. Like any of the roll ups will always be able to censor you. What you can do is you can progress transactions by submitting transactions on the base layer. So transactions get enforced on the second layer. However, you're still censored from using the second layer.
00:39:28.659 - 00:39:49.855, Speaker C: Now you have to use the base layer to do something. And so basically you get excluded from a whole economy potentially. And so unfortunately decentralized actors won't Ever have the censorship resistance, but you can still have the more trustlessness that you can trust that they don't steal any money. Does that make sense?
00:39:50.515 - 00:39:51.327, Speaker B: It does.
00:39:51.491 - 00:39:56.475, Speaker C: It's very convoluted and it's very confusing. But yeah, it sounds different.
00:39:57.375 - 00:40:31.425, Speaker B: Yeah, the way I hear it. So yeah, the censorship positions piece is helpful. It sounds like the thing I was getting crossed is like they can't steal because you have your private key. As long as your private key isn't leaked, the way that the cryptography works, they can't steal any funds. So like you're good there. That's the kind of trustless piece of it. Going back to what you said earlier, it was, it was like a sideline, but you were like, I don't really think the trustlessness kind of like North Star that everyone's saying is going to yield what we think it's going to yield.
00:40:31.425 - 00:40:37.825, Speaker B: Which is kind of a fiery comment. But I'm curious, like, how do you think through that when you say that comment?
00:40:38.525 - 00:41:07.185, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So a lot of people in the industry believe or often have this idea. Roll ups have been sold as like this full endgame. Like it's fully trustless, anything is possible and we have unlimited scalability and it comes at zero cost. And that is not the reality. And there's a few things that play into that. I think the censorship resistance is 1.
00:41:07.185 - 00:42:11.233, Speaker C: That's one obvious cost. I think the less obvious cost, and it's still open to debate, is what I call the bug risk. So what if a bug is found in this immutable roll up? What if you can no longer upgrade the roll up and to use a bitcoin comparison, what if you make a ZK verifier in a certain utxo, right? And now a bug is found in what's behind that utxo? You can never really change that anymore. And so the only way to do that is kill the whole roll up and move that to something else. But how do you do that? Who decides then? And do they have any powers at that moment to steal something? And so you always come back to a little bit of consensus. I don't believe a fully trustless L2 is possible without consensus. And so the roll ups, if they find the bug risk right now, how they do it is they are of course a multisig.
00:42:11.233 - 00:42:53.009, Speaker C: And so they can upgrade the smart contract by using this multisig. And so I mean, every L2 has a different multisig size. But that's the basic trust assumption. For example, if you have a six out of nine. That basically means all you need to steal all the funds on the L2 is a six out of nine multisig. And so you suddenly have this majority assumption. And so longer term, are we actually going to be able to move away from that? Are we actually on Ethereum then in Ethereum land, are you actually going to be able to deploy this in a immutable smart contract? Because what if a bug is found? How are you going to do that? That's it, game over.
00:42:53.009 - 00:43:45.329, Speaker C: Everybody loses their funds in the whole world. There's not a single developer in the world that wants to do that. And it also might not be good as a world where you want to move to. So you kind of want to have that upgradeability. And so actually the road that Arbitrum is taking is I think where all the all different roll ups are going to eventually you can see, let's make a vote with all the ARP tokens to upgrade the smart contract, right? And so now let's say 2/3 of all the ARP tokens can decide can vote and now we can upgrade the smart contract. And so you still don't have the trust because if you can, if you can reach 2/3 of all the ARP tokens and like buy huge amount of ARP tokens, you can suddenly steal a lot of money. And so either way you always look at it or you turn it, there's always this corner or this flip side of a thing you won't be able to solve in the long term.
00:43:45.329 - 00:44:25.725, Speaker C: And so that's why I say like, I don't believe this full trustless North Star is actually achievable from a, yeah, practical standpoint. Now another thing that people often say is okay, we can introduce like a delay, like a multisig plus a delay, but then you still have a bunch of different attack factors, right? Like okay, what if actually a bug is found? Then you have a window of that delay that people can abuse it. Or if someone wants to maliciously upgrade, all they need to do is like wait a bit, just hide it long enough and then wait. And so yeah, this is always this reality that plays into roll ups.
00:44:26.065 - 00:44:55.053, Speaker B: Super interesting. Yeah, you've seen this in small regards on a lot of DEFI projects. While some will have admin keys to upgrade, others are perfectly immutable. And when you're playing with millions of dollars, that's interesting. It sucks if you get hacked, for example, but you're using the word practical very deliberately, which is at the lowest level of the Stack. If bitcoin had this kind of bug and it was perfectly immutable, it would be a shit show to the nth degree. Like, that would be bad.
00:44:55.053 - 00:44:55.893, Speaker B: So.
00:44:56.069 - 00:45:08.701, Speaker C: And that's the benefit of consensus. Like, we had that bug in Bitcoin in 2018. Bitcoin Core upgraded, everybody upgraded their node, and boom, it was fixed. If it's immutable, then it's. Yeah, then it's game over.
00:45:08.893 - 00:45:23.799, Speaker B: Got it. Okay, that's super interesting. Okay, well, this has been a fascinating combo. Thank you. Willem, last question of the day. What are you most hyped about right now? It could be in bitcoin. It could be what you're building or just broadly, like, what.
00:45:23.799 - 00:45:25.075, Speaker B: What are you excited about?
00:45:25.775 - 00:46:10.065, Speaker C: I'm actually super excited to actually see this world running on bitcoin. Like, I want to see the whole world running on bitcoin actually playing out. You see, you see governments, you see politicians coming in, you see everybody. Like, this whole group of bitcoiners, like, expanding. And I'm very excited that we actually now can start building these applications that we've seen actually on bitcoin as well. I think bitcoin is the perfect money ever. And then when I look at Ethereum and Defi, that is a better, more fairer, more equal financial system in the world where you have tokens that are 24, seven, that are better stocks, you have decentralized exchanges that are better than the stock exchanges where anyone in the world can buy them, where you can borrow against your bitcoin.
00:46:10.065 - 00:46:32.209, Speaker C: This is. This is slowly starting to look like a world that is. That would be incredible to live in. So I'm super excited. Like, I really hope we can bring this to life. And I often say this to my team, like, what we're actually building as this decentralized L2 can actually power a global financial system with bitcoin as the money. And that's just.
00:46:32.209 - 00:46:39.105, Speaker C: That's just massive or, like, incredible when you. When you try to think about it. Yeah, Just drives me every day.
00:46:40.285 - 00:46:50.821, Speaker B: And that is a fantastic way to end the show. So happy for what you guys are building. Super interesting. Willem, thanks so much for coming on the show, my man.
