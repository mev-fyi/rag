00:00:00.240 - 00:00:31.770, Speaker A: So the spy chain is a little bit like a mix of the ones you've mentioned and consider it more of a mix of the lightning network together with federations. And it's very similar. Like a fediment is also a bunch of different federations where people can launch their own federations and it's a little bit similar to that. In essence, the spider chain is what we call the series of decentralized multi sigs. In essence, everything is often a multisig. And so the lightning network is a two out of two multisig. And so very cool.
00:00:31.770 - 00:00:59.910, Speaker A: The whole lightning network, when you look from a very high level perspective, is this whole network of two out of two multisigs between all different people. And you call them channels. It's beautiful. And so if you park that idea but then think bigger and you want to recreate that whole network of decentralized multisigs, that's what we're trying to do with the spider chain. And how in essence it works is that you create this series of bigger multisigs. Anyone will be able to participate.
