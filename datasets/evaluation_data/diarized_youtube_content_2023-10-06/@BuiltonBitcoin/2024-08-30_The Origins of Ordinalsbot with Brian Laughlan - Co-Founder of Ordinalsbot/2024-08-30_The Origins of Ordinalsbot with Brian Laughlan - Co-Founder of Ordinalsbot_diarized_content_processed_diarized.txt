00:00:00.680 - 00:00:48.112, Speaker A: If you've inscribed something as an ordinal, there's a pretty good chance you've used today's guest service. Today I got none other than Brian Laughlin Bruffstar on Twitter on the pod. He is the co founder of Ordinals Bot, which was the first service to make it easy to inscribe things and has since turned into a big company, doing all kinds of drops, building out a robust API and a bunch of other things which I'm going to touch on. But first, welcome back, everybody, to the Built on Bitcoin podcast. I am your humble host, Jacob Brown. And you know what we do here? We're talking to the best founders in bitcoin. This podcast is one part technical, one part tactical, one part vibes.
00:00:48.112 - 00:01:46.470, Speaker A: So today you're going to learn something while you get your stats back. But as I was saying, Brian has been in the bitcoin space for a minute. He actually started on ETH and launched a Satoshi focused ETH NFT collection, which is pretty interesting origin story. And actually how he slowly moved into bitcoin is also super interesting. But then we talk about the origins of ordinals bot and what made him want to build this. What were some of the early headaches? How do they think about designing good products and a bunch of other topics? So if you're a builder and you want to learn some kind of nuances and tactics from someone who has succeeded in building a pretty big company, this is a great one for you. So without further ado, let's jump into this fantastic conversation with Brian Laughlin, aka Bruffstar, the co founder of Ordinalsbot.
00:01:51.890 - 00:02:13.678, Speaker B: Welcome to built on Bitcoin. Cool. All right, Brian. Sup, Daniel man, how are you?
00:02:13.854 - 00:02:17.854, Speaker C: Really good, Marvin. Thanks for having me, daddy man, thanks.
00:02:17.982 - 00:02:45.600, Speaker B: Big to see you, as always. I've seen you at the conferences and I always a good time. But, um, yeah, I want to. I want to. I've known you for a while, and I want to kind of go back to some ancient history of Satoshi balls and kind of like, what, what is this dope collection you had that was on ETh and then like, lead me in a little bit into your journey back into bitcoin, because I think that's super interesting.
00:02:46.180 - 00:03:11.612, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I mean, we have knew each other for a few years now. It's been a crazy, crazy ride when you think about it, you know? And this is my second time on the pod, which I'm super excited about. So good to be coming back on and continue my story, I guess, you know. But, yeah, it all started back in 2021. I watched a collection called Satoshi Balls on Ethereum, and it went really well. I watched it right at the perfect time.
00:03:11.612 - 00:03:33.432, Speaker C: You know, the NFT bull run was really ticking off at that point. People are really minting all these new collectibles and, you know, this is pre board day yacht club and things like that. So it was pretty. It was pretty cool. And I minted them on one weekend, and then that was my crypto journey. I quit my job the next day and went all in on it, essentially. But during the mint, I was watching all the mints coming in.
00:03:33.432 - 00:03:46.214, Speaker C: You know, I was just shocked to see you and people actually minting this thing. Like, one mint, two mints. You mint? It's actually working. Oh, my God. I. And then someone minted 50 of them. 50, like, for one eth.
00:03:46.214 - 00:04:26.690, Speaker C: And I'm just like, holy shit. Like, what the hell? And then that person slid into my DM's, and it was none other than Trevor Owens, who is, of course, a huge bitcoin. You know, l two advocate, entrepreneur, legend. And he's like, hey, dude, these are really cool, but this Satoshi basically belongs on bitcoin. And I went, bro, like, bitcoin doesn't have nfts. What are you talking about? And he's like, well, actually, have you had a stacks before? And that then led me down the stacks rabbit hole, and I went all in like everyone else did in that ecosystem. I created Stacks bridge, which was what the previous interview on the pod was about.
00:04:26.690 - 00:04:49.630, Speaker C: Stacks bridge migrated a community from ethereum to stacks. It was really cool. We got 70% bridged over. We introduced a lot of. Of our holders, two stacks and two bitcoin. So back there, it was a real, real exciting time. So I was building that out, building with the stacks ecosystem at the same time, and then ordnance comes along, and then it's like, boom.
00:04:49.630 - 00:04:51.910, Speaker C: Changed everything else.
00:04:52.290 - 00:05:16.026, Speaker B: Yeah. Off to the races. Yeah. The cool thing is, I think there is a theme here, which is like, you've been kind of doing stuff that's previously viewed as kind of impossible, or at least very difficult, because even bridging from east to stacks, like, no one was doing that. So you were. You were banging her hangings the wall, trying to solve that problem. And same thing with.
00:05:16.026 - 00:05:39.690, Speaker B: With ordinals bot where it's like, ordinals pops off. No one knows what the fuck they're doing, how to. How to use these tools. And so, like, help me understand that thought process of, like, ordinals start to pop. What's going through your head as you're watching this? But as you go into building out this first subscription service?
00:05:40.950 - 00:06:11.432, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, as I say, I always had a close finger on the pulse in terms of bitcoin collectibles. When you look at stocks, stocks were essentially touting as bitcoin collectibles. So I was always in that ecosystem. And then by the end of 2020, I think I stumbled upon Casey's podcast, Casey Rodimer, the creator of ordinal, his podcast, and just, like, really instantly kind of got it. I don't know what happened. I just really understood. I thought, okay, this is cool.
00:06:11.432 - 00:06:38.906, Speaker C: You actually just make sats non fungible, and then you can apply data inside. So I was like, I get the concept. I really dig ordinal's theory, the way he explained it. And I'm like, okay, how do I do it then? How do I inscribe something? Like, what do I do? It turns out like, I'm a front end developer, right? So I'm like, this is too much for me, all this GitHub tutorial stuff. I'm like, oh, my goodness. So I reached out to a friend of mine who has worked with actually run the bridge, the stacks bridge. I said to him, okay, if you had this ordinals thing.
00:06:38.906 - 00:06:56.546, Speaker C: And he was like, yeah, reluctantly said, yes. He's like, but I'm already building something. I said, ah, cool, what is it? It's a way to automate the process. I says, dude, that's exactly what I need. Like, let's put a front end on it and we'll launch this thing. So we literally built it over the weekend. I put a front end on what he was working on.
00:06:56.546 - 00:07:34.946, Speaker C: We launched it, and it just went absolutely haywire because at the time, to inscribe an ordinal, I found out about it in December. You know, 2022. Casey launched on Mainnet January 2023. And we launched Ardnal spot on February 7, 2023. So, like, it was really, really early on. And at that time to inscribe things, people were already getting the gist of it and going, okay, I get this. So people were racing to do these early inscriptions and get in early on this new ecosystem, because you look at the history, you look at crypto punks, and you look at other early type collections or other chains that are now going for a large amount or went for a large amount.
00:07:34.946 - 00:08:02.812, Speaker C: That was the rush of people. Like, I want to get early and inscribe this stuff early. So at the time, yeah, people were minting collections and there was a, basically a thing called crypto punk, bitcoin punks, which is essentially like a carbon copy clone of crypto punks that people were inscribing them on chain. And the first one to inscribe them essentially got it. But to do that, people were in discord saying, hey, bro, give me $1,000 and I'll steal it for you. I've got a node set up. Trust me, bro.
00:08:02.812 - 00:08:22.726, Speaker C: And all that kind of thing. So that was the norm. And there's excel sheets involved and all sorts of dodgy deals involved. And we come along with a service where essentially it's a website. You drag and drop the file and then we inscribe it and send it to you. And that just kind of leaked in their discord and it blew up. We suddenly got like thousands of dj's on our website and they melted our server.
00:08:22.726 - 00:08:37.028, Speaker C: We had this, we were down for 6 hours. We had to scale up again. It was really, really like, talk about product market fit. This was like since the first hour. It was absolutely crazy. And then. Yeah, just been growing it since then, growing with the ordinals ecosystem.
00:08:37.028 - 00:08:38.580, Speaker C: And it's been really fun.
00:08:39.160 - 00:08:47.464, Speaker B: Yeah, it's, it's like, it's funny because some of us are cars. I was old and those ogs, which kind of feels funny because like we're. It's two years tops.
00:08:47.552 - 00:08:49.168, Speaker C: Not even. Not one and a half. Yeah. One, two.
00:08:49.224 - 00:09:02.844, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels, it feels almost disrespectful to say an Og event until you've like gone through a cycle almost. But with runes, it was weird because runes were so telegraphed that like on day one we had hella infrastructure.
00:09:02.992 - 00:09:03.364, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:03.412 - 00:09:26.160, Speaker B: And it was like you didn't need to run a node, but with ordinals was the exact opposite where it's like people are spinning up nodes to try and figure it out for the first time. You see like the node count skyrocket and then you guys came out and it was like, for three weeks it was like the only way that you would be inscribing things was because there was just nothing else out there, which is crazy to see.
00:09:27.340 - 00:09:33.790, Speaker C: I've got a stop for you. At that time, it was really early days. 40% of all inscriptions were going through our service.
00:09:34.170 - 00:09:35.170, Speaker B: Oh my God.
00:09:35.290 - 00:09:45.550, Speaker C: Which is absolutely insane considering there was like 5000 ordinals before we launched. And then the day after, it was like 15,000, which is just crazy.
00:09:45.890 - 00:10:13.708, Speaker B: Yep. Insane. Insane. So. And that was like you were trying to solve, making it easy for someone to just drag an image, add a couple steps where you're going to receive the inscription. So it was like a very basic front end, but it seems like it's evolved over time. So starting with that, what is ordinals bot now you guys have an API, I've heard.
00:10:13.708 - 00:10:18.680, Speaker B: What are all the ways that you guys are interacting and building infra now?
00:10:19.540 - 00:10:47.336, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. Like you said, we started off as just like a simple drag and drop mechanism. And then I think very early on someone wanted to use that in their own website for some other project. So we essentially extracted our back end and put it through an API. So we, like, we launched that API really early. Like, I think it was in the first few weeks we had an API up, so. And then that kind of moved us already into being an API first company.
00:10:47.336 - 00:11:27.882, Speaker C: So we realized quite early, oh, actually, if everything we build other people can use, we should just build out the API first, then integrate it into our app, meaning with two birds, with 1 st kind of thing, and everyone can then use that API. So that's exactly the mindset we've had since then. Yeah, we've built our API to be going with the times, let's say, in terms of how ordinals has evolved. Because when you think about it, when ordinals launched in January, Casey and Raf themselves have come out publicly and said it wasn't ready. Like the ordinals client and wallet, like, wasn't ready in January last year because, like, they didn't expect it to blow up. You know, KT just wanted it online. Didn't really think, didn't really think it was going to kick off.
00:11:27.882 - 00:12:16.630, Speaker C: So they thought they had time to actually evolve this over like a year. They actually blow up like almost instantly. So the ordinals like, protocol itself only got me, got to maturity like pretty much by the end of last year, if that, you know, like, because if you remember through a whole lot of different kind of the cost inscriptions and all sorts of crazy things there. So as a builder company, when you're building against that as well, you need to try and keep up, right? Because obviously when they release a new version, you want to give those features to your end users and maybe it's a critical bug as well. You need. So you need to keep up with that ever changing kind of core protocol that you're building on top of. So that was a challenge then, but we know we managed to get through that and it quickly evolved into people then, like, okay, I've done photos of my cat and my great uncle, or whatever it is.
00:12:16.630 - 00:13:18.380, Speaker C: But like now people are realizing, oh, wait a minute, there's actually collections to be had here. So the collections started dropping and people started saying, how do I launch my ten K PFB collection that I've got sitting here? Or how do I migrate from Ethereum and launch something on bitcoin with a community I've already got? So we captured a lot of that market and we had the first ever inscription on demand service, which was born out of the fact that it's not easy to mint a ten K PFP collection on bitcoin like you can do on other chains where you just actually mint the whole collection, then kind of distribute them. It's very expensive to do that on bitcoin. So we come up with this mechanism where essentially just give us the files and we'll give you a mint page and then people can pay to mint and we'll just serve up the files as they, as they inscribe, basically. So it's actually zero upfront cost for the project and you offload the inscription costs to the end user. So that was very successful at the beginning because, again, it's like low bar FDA entry for most people. They can get their toes wet and just see how it goes.
00:13:18.380 - 00:14:02.290, Speaker C: Then, you know, quite early on, magic Eden committed the fold as well, which is random, because I got a DM from someone which had, like, magic Eden in their name. And I'm like, this is definitely a scam. Someone's trying to scam me here. You know, it turns out it was actually magic Eden. And they were interested in our API, they were interested in what we were doing, because from their mind, they're obviously a billion dollar company. They've also done greater Solana and Ethereum, and they've got two very, very smart co founders that are like, this has got to be a thing on bitcoin. We want to get involved, but how can we do it in the most minimum amount of the non destructive way from our core business? So they wanted to move really fast with magic Eden and get their bitcoin marketplace up and running.
00:14:02.290 - 00:14:34.044, Speaker C: So they were looking at builders in the space. We were one of those builders. We already had quite advanced knowledge of inscriptions and stuff and, yeah, we partnered up with them. So they wanted to essentially launch pre inscribed collections. So we did all of the inscriptions for those early collections that magic union dropped. So essentially they would just offload the project to me, would then, like, work with that project, say, okay, show me your artwork. What are you actually trying, like, launch here on bitcoin, and nine times out of ten, it would be four megabyte images times 10,000.
00:14:34.044 - 00:14:58.360, Speaker C: I'm like, dude, that, we can't do that. Like, it'll cost you, like, a thousand bitcoin. Like, is this not possible? So I'd work with them to try and, like, maybe optimize the size down without, like, you losing the quality. Maybe we could then reach into, like, breaking up and by that point, recursive, like, kind of the place. So I could. I could recursively build, collect collections and I kind of really learned a lot about that. So, yeah, back in the day, we launched maybe, like, most.
00:14:58.360 - 00:15:21.920, Speaker C: Most of the collections that launched on Madrid Eden came through our system in terms of me onboarding them and getting the collection ready to go to be sold on Madrid Eden. And then, yeah, since then, again, we've now grown into, we've got our own marketplace API. We've got our own, obviously, inscriptions API. We've just launched a project called Token Pay. We're launching our own marketplace. Like, we're pretty much doing everything at this point, so it's been quite a journey.
00:15:23.060 - 00:15:44.574, Speaker B: Insane. One thing that stands out is that a lot of founders have a hard time figuring out what to build. It's a super difficult question as a founder to know what the market really needs. And it sounds like the main thing. You start with solving your own pain point, which is, like, inscriptions are hard af. So let's make it easier for myself first. But then the market can use it.
00:15:44.574 - 00:16:07.506, Speaker B: But then it sounds like a lot of it was just this inscription, as a service, is kind of like a white glove. Customers come to me with needs and I'm just solving their needs. And then on the backend, I'm going to find out how to automate it. So you start doing, like, four megahers or big collections, and you're doing it for the first time, and then as you do it, you can kind of, like, systematize it. Like, is that kind of how this happened?
00:16:07.698 - 00:16:35.722, Speaker C: Yes, that's quite accurate, for sure. I mean, me and my co founders is very much on that same wavelength. It's like, let's just try something and get it out there and do the job. And then how do we automate it is definitely one of our core principles, so we're always looking to do that. And that means then properly building up the product, properly building out APIs and documentation for it, and then put into the wild. So that's how a lot of our projects are and products are born here.
00:16:35.916 - 00:17:04.016, Speaker B: Yep. And then how does, because you say you're an API first company and another person that says that is lunar Crush, which is another one of our portfolio companies. So we got you guys. We have amazing founders at BFF. But yeah, Lunar Crush has the same mentality, which is like, we want to be the best user of our API. And through that, you build the right tooling that you need and then you serve it to like a beautiful front end, for example. But I'm just curious on that.
00:17:04.016 - 00:17:27.980, Speaker B: So a company is trying to figure out what to build for their API company. And for example, right now, recursion is still kind of hard to use. So how do you think about building tools for Ord when there's gaps in the market or updating in real time? How do you dance with this line of what to build for your company?
00:17:28.830 - 00:17:54.850, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm, I mean, I'm co founder, but I'm also de facto head of product and front end manager. I'm doing a lot of things, but I really am passionate about the product side of building really cool products. So with that comes a million ideas a day. Right? So I'm always thinking of cool things in it. I always bring it to the team. Like, let's do this, let's do this. So it is very much a hard thing to, like, focus and pick up with the winners there.
00:17:54.850 - 00:18:30.186, Speaker C: We just released another one called or me, which has got to be a whole ordinal social media thing. Like, it just doesn't stop essentially. But a lot of us as just like, get out there, get an MVP out there and then see how the market reacts to it. And then let's build on, like, just let the market dictate what works and what doesn't work. You know, some examples of that was like, rare sats, for example. You know, we built some tooling around that and then we, we got like, people saying, I want to inspire sats. It's like, okay, that's an obvious one.
00:18:30.186 - 00:18:48.290, Speaker C: Let's build that feature. So we basically built into an encryption flow where people can choose the rare sats that they want to inscribe on. So, like, a lot of it is market dictated. But that's not to say that I don't go off on tangent sometimes and just like, scratch, scratch a niche that I want to, like I've been thinking about for a while, you know, so. Yeah.
00:18:48.830 - 00:19:32.110, Speaker B: Yep. That makes sense. One thing you mentioned is like, you had this mint on EtH that went really well and you come to ordinals is how different is minting on ETH versus on ordinals, because like one of the things you mentioned earlier was like you had this great service where the inscription would happen at the time of purchase, so it was pushed to the buyer. And that's great because ordinals can be expensive as shit and you can put up one hundred k and then flops and you're just ass out. So yeah, talk to me about the, is there like what are the things you learned of, like the difference between ETh and ordinals? And I have a follow up question.
00:19:32.410 - 00:20:22.896, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I mean, the number one thing, in my opinion, is one of the things where I went all in on bitcoin ordinals, as the fact that that is stored on chain. Like, number one, the reason why you should be launching things on bitcoin, if you have the choice. I launched the torsion was on Ethereum and it always irked me that I'm pointing somewhere else for the actual file, whether it be ipfs or arweave or whatever else it is. So that's always been a kind of pain point for me about Ethereum collections is that these things are pointers essentially to somewhere else. And even that even, are we even ipfs that's not magically stored somewhere? Someone has to hold those ipfs like that IPFS data. So it's not forever, it's not permanent.
00:20:22.896 - 00:21:12.750, Speaker C: Someone has to maintain those server costs. And if I just look at the Internet, try and sign me a web page from 1992 or whatever, it was like they're all offline now, they're all dead links, basically. And that's going to happen, unfortunately, with a lot. A big majority of the Ethereum nfts were said to just be pointing to dead links. And a classic example is that these FTX collectibles, literally the government changed the link to the image and now sees an image that says, your image is now owned by the us government. Like it's just not, it's just so obvious that having the data on chain is just absolutely amazing feature of inscriptions and ordinals to the point where it's almost like caveman level painting, you know, historical stuff. So I was just, I'm so bullish on that and I'm so on on that.
00:21:12.750 - 00:22:01.066, Speaker C: There's some other things that I'm quite bullish on in terms of differences, which is, you know, smart contracts themselves on Ethereum, opened Pandora's box and really took web3 another level, of course. Right. I take that away from it, but also does open up the scamming and a lot of fraud and a lot of like, cowboy programming and people losing quite a heavy, a large amount of money on bitcoin. What I like about bitcoin is it's very bitcoin native. The Ardenos ecosystem is built on top of bitcoin in a very, very clean way where it didn't require any changes to bitcoin. The whole marketplace infrastructure is propped up on pre existing technology, psdts, you know, partially signed bitcoin transactions, which are core bitcoin functionality. There's no smart contracts.
00:22:01.066 - 00:22:14.430, Speaker C: The ordinals theory indexer is very, very simple. It's just an index. So yeah, there's a lot of things that are pros and cons. Bitcoin has its limitations as well, of course.
00:22:14.770 - 00:22:52.550, Speaker B: Yep, yep. And like you said, the big one is being on chain because that as long as bitcoin's around, these things will be around. But one thing that comes with that is high fees, which is like, right now, it's cheap and it's been expensive in the past. We've seen some crazy fee spikes. So the fact that we know there's possibility that we can go up to 1000 sats per gigabyte. For example, as a provider of tooling for ordinals, how do you guys think about building tooling to mitigate things that you know are going to happen, like high fees?
00:22:53.690 - 00:23:31.212, Speaker C: Um, yeah, you know, fees are part, part and parcel with, with any blockchain. I remember back in 2021 or 2022, whatever defi somewhat happened, I think it's 2020. You're spending more on Ethereum gas fees to like extract your crypto defi earnings than it would to actually what you're earning. So, you know, Ethereum is not perfect either in terms of fees. So in bitcoin, very much as PvP and the fee market there is thriving now because of ordinals. But that's all good. When you buy your collection, it's now costing you literally 100 x more than it would have a month ago.
00:23:31.212 - 00:24:15.630, Speaker C: Is not the best pill to swallow when you're trying to launch something there. But my advice is mostly, well, again, is there enough demand for your project, right, because people would pay for it. Is there ways that we can get your inscription file size down to save a lot, a lot of cost? Simply by there's actually like, let's say you had a 100 piece image collection and those images might be already like 200 to 300 kb. You could literally drop them through, like, go to tinypng.com, literally. And it's a lossless image compressor. Optimizer and without any visual quality, you've saved 70% file size.
00:24:15.630 - 00:24:44.782, Speaker C: And that 70% file size directly correlates to the actual inscription cost, you know, because it's all about bites at the end of the day. So there's loads of tricks you can do to get around, you know, or optimize your kind of costs for sure. And then another bit of advice would be like, we've seen it go 1000 and now it's back down to three, right? So like, it's up and down. Like, you just need to pick your moment. If you've got time away, then you should, and it's more affordable for you to do. So they just wait line. The Menpo will go down again.
00:24:44.782 - 00:24:47.130, Speaker C: So that's my advice for free.
00:24:47.630 - 00:25:04.438, Speaker B: Do you, um. The other one people can do if they build the right collection, depending on the art, is recursion. Yeah. Do you have any pulse on people valuing solid pieces versus recursion or is that just made up arbitrary distinction?
00:25:04.614 - 00:25:47.848, Speaker C: Yes. Someone actually asked me that in the past and that make me ponder for a second, but I've not seen any evidence of one being more valuable than the other for that particular reason. There's one collection that I got in touch with and they gave me one and I got involved with them, which is this gold bars collection. And they actually did lean into the fact that, hey, these are heavy, big, meaty inscriptions that we paid a lot for to inscribe. Therefore, if we paid a lot to inscribe them, that intrinsically gives them more value. But it's a fleeting kind of argument because, like, yes, you've paid that lot, but you paid it to the miners. Not literally baked into that value.
00:25:47.848 - 00:26:20.548, Speaker C: The value is kind of gone at that point. So that's a weird one. Recursion, on the other hand, which I'm a huge advocate of, obviously, I wrote a medium article on it really, really early, and then I really took it to the next level when I worked on pizza ninjas with Trevor. That was recursion to the next level, what we did for those guys. So I think there's also value to be said. That recursion opens up a lot more opportunities to build value into your NFT and that getaway. I mean, when you look at what we've done with pizza ninjas, when you open the menu, you can resize it.
00:26:20.548 - 00:26:52.094, Speaker C: There's a game emulator, there's the animation editor. Like, try doing that with a JPeg, you know, so it's like, this depends on what you're trying to, like, achieve. And. And, yeah, what you see is valuable, I guess, you know, but when it comes to maybe, like, artwork that just can't be broken up, maybe photography, like, look what Casey just did with the fun collection. Right? I think it's called fun. Right? That's beautiful photography. Right? And they just spent the time actually inscribing them over time when their input was low.
00:26:52.094 - 00:26:58.290, Speaker C: And at the end, you've now got really high quality images on ordinals as well. So there's just different ways of doing it.
00:26:58.710 - 00:27:20.882, Speaker B: Yep. Yep. Okay, makes sense. A couple more questions. This has been great. How do you guys view all these different metaprotocols and the kind of the l two s? Because you have ordinals and you have runes, which are, like, Casey certified. And then you have 17,000 other meta protocols launching and all the established l two s and the new l two s coming online.
00:27:20.882 - 00:27:27.070, Speaker B: So, like, as a builder watching the space, how do you guys pick what to support?
00:27:27.530 - 00:27:43.864, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. And first of all, my personal opinion is I love it. I think the more stuff building on bitcoin, the better, in my opinion. We need this diverse culture and ecosystems. And I actually said it last year at the bitcoin conference. I said there'll be a. There'll be a cambrian explosion of l two s and meta protocols.
00:27:43.864 - 00:28:07.964, Speaker C: And that's now, obviously, it's evident. There's just so many things happening. If you rewind back to the beginning, essentially, the first one was actually like the SATs naming service. I don't know if you remember that one. So the SATs naming service was laid out the blueprint, essentially, for what Metaprotocost could be on top of ordinals. They were the first ones to use the JSON. They were the first one to use that.
00:28:07.964 - 00:28:37.160, Speaker C: First is first principle, where if I do Jake sats first, it's mine and that's it. And anyone after it doesn't. So they laid out the blueprint for that, and it was sats names. So we, of course, like, at the time, that was the only one to be like, let's build tooling around about it. So I built an interface where you can click on it, you take your name that you want. We actually built our own search tool where you could search and to see if that was available and then you could register it. So I built that UI for that sats naming.
00:28:37.160 - 00:29:22.620, Speaker C: Then Domo, the creator of BRC 20, took inspiration from SATS and could say that actually we can do kind of something similar to make a fungible protocol because then I could just say the first person to launch or the token is then the owner of that. So he used the first as first principle, he used the JSON and it built the BRC 28 standard, which we completely faded, like ultimately and completely faded because we're like, that's the dumbest shit ever, you know, and we completely faded it. And of course never, never, never feared anything that DJ's are going to like. When you warn DJ to say don't mention this is absolutely useless. That was the thought we should have actually doubled down on it because that's then fuel to their fire. And as you've seen, it just went crazy. Already went to a billion dollars.
00:29:22.620 - 00:30:02.628, Speaker C: We Unisat did a really great job in that regard. And then we came along, we did some things with our API and also built our inscription tooling. We built the reason we were quite successful in that, let's say not as much as other platforms, but the likes of leather and X first used us quite early on for BRC 20 transfers and the like. So that was pretty cool. And then another fun BRCA 20 story was randomly one day I put the ord token, which is the first ever BRc 20 token that Domo launched. I put the inscription id into our database and an order popped up and I'm like, no way. So I dm'd Domo.
00:30:02.628 - 00:30:29.536, Speaker C: There's now like an advisor of ours as well. I met him a few times. He's like, I said to him, did you launch Rd with Ardeno's bot? And he says, yeah, it was my first ever inscription. And I says, dude, I'm going to milk the hell out of that. Every podcast I'm on, every time we see, I'm going to see what you just told me there. So yeah, he launched, or they essentially through Ardno's bot as an inscription, text inscription at the time. And that went on to be a billion dollar token and we inscribed zero of it.
00:30:29.536 - 00:31:15.112, Speaker C: Like it's, like it launched through our own platform and we're not sitting here massive back holders. That's how much we slept on Brt 20. So what was a great, what was great about it was, it was just like a massive door opener for djns to come in and get it because dgens are different slightly from like retail collectors, because these ends will go through the pain to be early at something and they don't care if it's through hoops. And I need to learn this new thing and they go through that pain to get that. And that equated to billions of dollars of volume, basically. And also like the inspection count going from literally 100,000 to a million over like the course of a week and then hitting tens of millions because of PSC 20. Yeah.
00:31:15.112 - 00:31:39.482, Speaker C: And then Casey came out, came along and, and said, well, I don't think I should do it like this. If I was going to do a token standard, this is how I do it. And of course then runes was born and then they had this two competing. You've got these two competing fundable kind of standards and then. Yeah, l two s are really fascinating things for me. I think there's some great l two s popping up. Obviously we came from, we cut our, cut our mustard, whatever that saying is.
00:31:39.482 - 00:32:10.170, Speaker C: And stacks. Right. So that's, that's, that's got to be in my opinion, very, very um, exciting to see when Nakamog is released and people start to see that quick block time and then it's got the history there as well. So I think stacks is for me going to be very exciting within the next year. But you've got others creeping up like Bob are doing really great things as well. Really. Like Bob built on bitcoin, which is hilariously the name of this podcast, I think, is it not? You should sue them.
00:32:10.170 - 00:32:10.972, Speaker C: And.
00:32:11.036 - 00:32:13.380, Speaker B: Yeah, we got to talk, Alexei. We got to talk.
00:32:13.500 - 00:32:25.388, Speaker C: Yeah. And then there's. Yeah, again, there's many other l two s happening. But yeah, for me it's like the bitcoin's a fee market and that's how you get it by building all these cool altars and meta protocols.
00:32:25.564 - 00:32:34.052, Speaker B: Yeah. Is there any on the shortlist? Not to drop any alpha, but like that you guys are watching more closely than others because you support runes already, right?
00:32:34.196 - 00:33:06.790, Speaker C: Yeah, we had to double down our runes, of course. So like we, we actually have our runes launchpad live as well. So with that collection launchpad and we did BRC 20 launchpad where people could essentially distribute their BRC 20. And then we've now got our runes launchpad which is the same functionality. Again, the question is why? Well, the reason is because people might want to distribute the tokens in their own way. Whereas a Fairmint, your Fairmints are by the way the most amazing thing that ever happened. I think it's the most really, really cool thing that Don wanted to just do was the fair mint mechanism.
00:33:06.790 - 00:33:45.168, Speaker C: However, when you've got maybe a utility token or a business or whatever and you have tokenomics and you're giving away a certain portion as a sale, then you need tooling such as launchpads. And that's what we offered. Also, our token pay product now is started with runes where essentially now it's again an API. You can use token pay API to integrate it to your website, to receive, to take payments and runes. So we have integrated it in our service to allow people to mint with runes. Like actual, any rune you can now mint with it the project wants. If the project says, I'm going to do rock and roll collection, I want people to pay in dog token.
00:33:45.168 - 00:34:14.382, Speaker C: We can do that now, basically. But you could also then take our API and go create a Shopify website where you want people to buy t shirts with runes, for example. Our token pay API can do that. So runs, we definitely doubled down on tap and track. We were big fans of those guys and we did some tooling for that. So you can actually launch tap tokens through our platform as well. Atomico, I'm really quite big fan of that as well.
00:34:14.382 - 00:34:35.980, Speaker C: We had big, huge plans to explore atomicals, but then runes railroaded those plans, unfortunately. Yeah, this, there's quite a lot to go to. So at the beginning we were really stressed about like we need to do everything, you know, we need to really jump on everything and then it's like, actually, you know what? Just pick up. Let's just pick our lane and do it really, really well kind of thing.
00:34:36.020 - 00:34:42.440, Speaker B: So there you go. Yeah, just, just execute over time. The token pay. Token pay is huge.
00:34:42.820 - 00:34:43.556, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:43.708 - 00:35:21.904, Speaker B: Because I've been super bullish on runes as like, I think it's going to be, the way I've described is it's going to be like the fungible token, almost like I interoperability layer. Because if you look at all the ecosystems, everyone has a bridge on the roadmap from runes to their l two. So effectively you can go from rootstock into a runes bridge and then from the back into runes, you can go over to stacks, for example. And now these two are talking through two layers of abstraction. But the funny thing is people can't not think about meme coins. So they're like, oh yeah, let me pay in dog. That's stupid.
00:35:21.904 - 00:35:33.928, Speaker B: And it's like, yeah, for now, for now. But like we're going to get utility, we're going to get stable coins. All these are going to happen. And now you can use runes to pay for whatever you want.
00:35:34.064 - 00:35:50.394, Speaker C: There was once upon a time you could buy a Tesla with rune, with Dodge. Right? So, you know, it's not so crazy to say that a bitcoin meme coin could eventually get made, make it mainstream, you know. All we need is Elon Musk to come in and buy up some dog token and then we're off to the races, basically.
00:35:50.592 - 00:36:07.290, Speaker B: Yep, yep. All right, last question. What are you most excited about right now? It could be a bitcoin, it could be stuff you're working on, one of your 10,000 ideas or just like something general. What's got you super hyped right now?
00:36:07.790 - 00:36:54.978, Speaker C: Oh, there's so many things, actually. Like, honestly, it's been a year and a half now building in this space, and every, every single, like, week, almost is almost something cool happening. Me and my co founder Toby, are, like, leading a lot of the business development as well. We got off call sometimes I just like, dude, what is this life, man? Like, well, as you guys know, we launched the four mega in collaboration with the Pepe guys, with French Montana, we did Ghostface Killer, we did all these crazy things. It's like, what is this life? You know? And so it's been really exciting in that regard. And seeing all these cool ips and early adopters have big names coming into bitcoin, I think that's, for me, really exciting because we're now working also with the eldest estate. We're going to do like an officially stamped Elvis drop as well.
00:36:54.978 - 00:37:31.396, Speaker C: So I'm passionate about IP and, you know, there's a lot of real big players in the space. Like Trevor Owens is also really passionate about IP and he gets. He gets it. What he's building with pizza ninjas, he gets as well. So I think that IP, big IP in terms of digital collectibles, really belongs on bitcoin, just for the fact that it's bitcoin, but also the longevity and the fact that it's on chain, there's just no reason why you'd want to store high value IP assets anywhere else apart from bitcoin. So we're already seeing that happening. We've got Elvis, we've got big rap stars and all these other things that are coming in.
00:37:31.396 - 00:38:15.820, Speaker C: And now what we can do as builders is do it properly. I'm so upset when I look at, like, Ethereum back in the day, and Porsche, for example, launched a collection on Ethereum and it was just so lazy. It was just the same car with no utility and just like, dude, come on, a little bit more creative, a little more stock. Give someone something proud to own in their wallet as a collectible. Like, that's what collectibles are. As you've collected this thing and you're proud to, like, own it and represent that brand. So I think a lot of the builders in the space, especially us, are trying to emulate that, but on bitcoin and give it a real good goal at saying this is what digital collectibles should look like in a really, really big way and bring that Hasbro Pokemon mentality digitally and launch it on bitcoin.
00:38:15.820 - 00:38:56.060, Speaker C: So stay tuned for what we're about to drop, because we've got so many things in the pipeline in terms of ip that we've made great connections with, and that ties it into what it launches. The trio marketplace is going to launch pretty much before the end of the year, and trio is our token for anyone listening. And basically, the marketplace has got to be all about, it's got to be the trio marketplace, and we're going to utilize all these connections, we've got all these drops that we're doing and offer a really, really, really nice marketplace experience. All these four megas that we've done category there. And, yes, I've got to tie it back to the token. There'll be rewards and points and just a whole lot of fun, basically. So, yeah, I'm really excited about that.
00:38:56.440 - 00:39:08.008, Speaker B: There we go. Alph Alpha alert. Trio marketplace coming. And yeah, IP. IP is the move. Cool, man. This has been fantastic.
00:39:08.008 - 00:39:15.456, Speaker B: Always, always good to reconnect with you. Love what you guys have been cooking. Yeah. Thanks for coming in.
00:39:15.568 - 00:39:20.110, Speaker C: Thanks, man. We should do it every year. We should do it. And then I. We'll see if bitcoin go to the moon, basically.
00:39:20.150 - 00:39:31.702, Speaker B: So it's probably great, dude, let's fucking do it. The podcast will keep growing to the stratosphere, and you'll be on the stock market, publicly traded, like, slowly get there.
00:39:31.846 - 00:39:33.542, Speaker C: Definitely. Cheers, man.

00:40:40.306 - 00:41:07.780, Speaker D: It's gone? We playing the long game to the black rock? Chains with the rocks paid off from the blockchain? Going up hot octane? So we up in here like pomme making big noise, big money? Go play with your kid toys? You funny? I'm counting my bitcoin? We up and we been gone? It's gone? Laying it out? And we did this purposefully? Panning out like the kitchen currently it's like surgery way? It's earning me a nurse's salary for cryptocurrency? I'm on a vacate? Drinking coconuts while wearing polka dots? This ain't no hocus pocus? Listen up and learn? It's gone now.
