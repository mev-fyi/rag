00:00:00.400 - 00:00:54.470, Speaker A: Are roll ups the next big unlock to extend the use of bitcoin? An increasing number of teams are saying just that. And Edan Iago and the team behind bitcoin OS just dropped a white paper with a couple big new things. But first, what's up, y'all? Welcome back to the built on Bitcoin podcast, where we're talking to the best founders in bitcoin. I'm your host, Jacob Brown, and you know what we do here? We're talking to all the cool people building the latest stuff, trying to extend the use of BTC, the asset, or bitcoin, the network. And today I have Eden Iago back for a second time on the podcast because last week they dropped a white paper for something called bit, snark and grail. And so I wanted to get his take on what these things are. I keep hearing about roll ups.
00:00:54.470 - 00:01:20.694, Speaker A: I kind of get them, but not really. I need to spend more time digging the weeds. I haven't spent enough time in ETH to know what these things are. We go over that. We go over what the white paper is. What is bitcoin OS, which is kind of their framework for an interoperable system of rollups focused on bitcoin. This thing called Bitsnark, which is inspired by BitVM and Rail Bridge, which is a.
00:01:20.694 - 00:02:02.104, Speaker A: It's a one use of bitsnark focused on a practical and easy to use bridge that interacts with bitcoin. L1 and a roll up. In this episode, we definitely cover those three things of what is bitcoin Os, what is Bitsnark and Grailbridge from this white paper, and how do they all intersect? I also wanted to get his take on the halving and the runes launch and a bunch of other topics. So without further ado, let me introduce this excellent episode with Adan Yago, core contributor at Sovereign, and bitcoin Os.
00:02:07.364 - 00:02:10.064, Speaker B: Welcome to built on bitcoin.
00:02:19.744 - 00:02:22.964, Speaker C: All right, Iago, welcome back. How are you?
00:02:23.544 - 00:02:25.204, Speaker B: I'm well. How are you?
00:02:25.624 - 00:02:40.364, Speaker C: I am. I'm good. This one's gonna be fun. I think you're in the elite pantheon of second time guests on the podcast. Might be, like the third guest to be in that one out of 150 episodes. So, first of all, congrats on that. Good to see you again.
00:02:40.994 - 00:02:45.694, Speaker B: Well, thanks for having me back. After the first time, I thought I would never be back.
00:02:48.514 - 00:03:17.528, Speaker C: No, man, this is. These are. I love these episodes. So, yeah, ton to talk about. You just dropped something like 3 hours ago. So we're definitely discussed this, but a couple quick, I want to get some quick topics on the having and runes and on kind of sovereign going multi chain, and then we can jump into like the meat and potatoes of this episode. So first you've been around a while, you've been through some halvings.
00:03:17.528 - 00:03:22.164, Speaker C: What was your pulse on seeing this having and like runes launching and all that craziness?
00:03:23.304 - 00:04:18.260, Speaker B: Well, I think this is the most important halving since the first one. I think the biggest question. All right, so I'm going to talk not from a bitcoiner's perspective, but from a crypto overview, right. I think the most important question in crypto is when does crypto do the same thing that every single other industry has ever done in the history of mankind, which is, starts out with fragmentation. Lots of, you know, somebody invents something and then a million versions of it are created, and then at some point there is a maturation phase and you move from fragmentation to consolidation. And this is doubly true in spaces where you have network effects. And nothing has more network effects than bitcoin and crypto, right? You've got the network effect of money, you've got the network effect of liquidity.
00:04:18.260 - 00:05:01.534, Speaker B: You've got the network effect of the actual blockchain network. You got the network effect of security. So the big question for anyone who's in crypto, right, not in bitcoin, but in crypto, is when does the consolidation start? Because when the consolidation starts, the type of party that they need to be at changes dramatically, right? You need to start being at the party of. You need to start going to the. To where the consolidation is going to happen. In my mind, that is obviously going to be bitcoin. So I think there are a number of factors to look at, but the biggest one is when does bitcoin break out of its self imposed limitations.
00:05:01.534 - 00:05:35.540, Speaker B: Those were the limitations that were limiting bitcoin's ability to fully utilize its massive network effect advantage. And the reason I think this halving is so important is because this is the halving where bitcoin is breaking out of those limitations and is going to be able to fully express its absolute network advantage. And as a result, this is the watershed. Halving, where the consolidation begins is most.
00:05:35.572 - 00:05:56.378, Speaker C: Of that coming from bitcoin being viewed as having more expensive use cases. Now we have quasi fungible token standards. We have ordinals which are quasi nfts. So most things are coming back to the mother chain and the meme of bitcoin as the forever chain. And the best money is underlying all that. Do you think those are the big drivers, or is it something else?
00:05:56.546 - 00:06:29.672, Speaker B: Well, specifically, I think from a technical perspective, the big driver is taproot. Right? So in 2021, we got taproot, a lot of sort of hype. Up until the taproot soft fork and then crickets, nothing happened. Everyone was like, oh, taproot's a failure. Didn't do anything, devs aren't using it, blah, blah, blah. Which was true only momentarily because it took. The thing about Taproot is it was a complex piece of technology and it took developers a while to figure out how to use it.
00:06:29.672 - 00:07:16.654, Speaker B: But then two years later, beginning of 2023, you get Casey introduces nfts on bitcoin ordinals. And bitcoin is like, you know, so that. Sorry, actually, that happened in December, right? But a few months later, March, April of 2023, that market woke up and bitcoin just became the most valuable NFT market in the world overnight without breaking a sweat. That is the power of network effects. Then Domo introduced BRC twenties. BRC Twenties became a multibillion dollar market practically overnight. Then at the end of that year, Robin Linus introduces bitvm.
00:07:16.654 - 00:08:10.294, Speaker B: Right? So now we can get roll ups, we can get bridging, we can introduce through ZK proofs all kinds of other things. Effectively, we're getting Turing complete capabilities for bitcoin. So we have a significant, like, this one technology, which everyone still underestimates, has produced so much dev, creativity and energy that, yes, it is now driving us into a world where bitcoin can do everything and everything will be done on bitcoin. And that turns bitcoin from just digital gold into digital gold plus. Right? That's BTC. BTC is digital gold, but bitcoin is the operating system for a decentralized future. Everything that's going to be decentralized, which I think is way more than people realize, is going to be decentralized on bitcoin.
00:08:11.434 - 00:08:52.754, Speaker C: That is an excellent, excellent take. Yeah, I remember I said somewhat often that tapper is the leading edge of bitcoin right now. And when AI first came out, there was like, prompt engineers to try and make the models as, like, do as much as you could. And I feel the same way about bitcoin, which is like, we don't just need bitcoin devs, we need tap script focus devs to just, like, get in the weeds and understand this to maximum effect. Given your closest to people building with Tapscript, do you have any idea, like, how explored is Tapscript currently in 2024? Because like, script, we understand well, but tap script is two years old, so they have a pulse of, like, are we 20% there? Like, any idea?
00:08:53.454 - 00:09:49.908, Speaker B: I don't know. I think my overall, I think there's a lot of additional innovation to come. I think that what, one of the things we're going to see is there's significant advances in the world of cryptography, and that is going to translate into new ways that we can use Taproot. But I think we're already so far ahead of where anyone expected us to be just four months ago, I would be, yeah, within a year, and probably before the end of this year, we're going to see multiple true roll ups of bitcoin. We're going to see execution environments secured by bitcoin. We're going to see near trustless ability to move bitcoin between multiple different layers. And that's going to mean that we get the ability to do scalability like never before.
00:09:49.908 - 00:10:18.906, Speaker B: We're going to have functionality and trust us development like never before. The ability to introduce privacy. I mean, today the DAoJ announced that they were going after the samurai wallet devs, right? Honestly, that was a long time coming. It's too centralized. But now those kind of things will be able to do at scale in a decentralized fashion, more efficiently, lower cost. And at the same time, we've got this meme. 21 million divided by infinity.
00:10:18.906 - 00:10:58.840, Speaker B: Right? Sorry? Infinity divided by 21 million. Right? Which is, like, all of the value that's going to go into the BTC. But bitcoin has eight megabytes of data available every ten minutes. That's very, very little. Up until now, we've lived in a world with cheap bitcoin transactions. Like, you know, until recently, people were, like, gnashing their teeth and pulling out their hair over the idea of whether or not bitcoin was going to be able to support itself after the subsidy ends. I think the era of cheap bitcoin transactions is over, because in addition to infinity over 21 million, we have infinite data.
00:10:58.840 - 00:11:07.044, Speaker B: Infinity over eight megabytes. And that is going to make bitcoin block space the most scarce digital asset in the world.
00:11:08.504 - 00:11:15.444, Speaker C: Makes sense. And you're saying eight megabytes there just to make sure you mean four, right? Or am I missing something?
00:11:18.244 - 00:11:29.372, Speaker B: Well, I'm adding in segwit, but maybe I've confused myself. I haven't slept in a long time, so I'm not going to. I'm not going to fight you on.
00:11:29.388 - 00:11:33.348, Speaker C: Then it's one. And then you go up to four segwit. And that's.
00:11:33.476 - 00:11:45.998, Speaker B: I may, I may be making a full of myself. If so, that's cool. But I think, I think it's eight. But I, but I. I may be sleep deprived to the point of dyslexia at this point.
00:11:46.126 - 00:12:04.350, Speaker C: This is going to be good for engagement because people will be like, what the hell is Yago talking about? It's blah, blah blah. So we'll be good there. Excellent. Excellent. Now this is great. And yeah, I want to jump into the rope stuff in a second. One other question though, about sovereign because you guys recently ish announced you're going multi chain.
00:12:04.350 - 00:12:28.284, Speaker C: You're taking part of the product suite over to Bob. And that was a big moment. Cause sovereign is one of the biggest DeFi platforms, if not the biggest, very strong brand. You guys have been around for a while, only on rootstock for the longest. Now you go multi chain. Just tell me about the decision to do that. What went into that and how do you see EVM chains and Bob just kind of at a high level?
00:12:28.584 - 00:13:05.046, Speaker B: Sovereign as a community has a few missions. One of them, sort of one of our slogans is you shouldn't have to be technical to be free. So we want to bring really easy to use DeFi. And it has to be defi because we don't want people using FTX and blockfi, etcetera, to lose their money. We want to bring bitcoin based decentralization to everyone. Another thing is we want to move the state of permissionless innovation on bitcoin forward. And so we'll talk about the white paper in a bit.
00:13:05.046 - 00:14:14.290, Speaker B: But out of sovereign, we've seen not just pioneering the space of bitcoin defi and bitcoin backed stable coins, but now also bitcoin roll ups. Sovereign was the first project to start talking about bitcoin roll ups three years ago and to start researching it and working on it. But the third thing is the most controversial, the most controversial thing that we're trying to do as a community is we want to expand bitcoin's audience into the world of crypto. We think that the people who are most ripe for adopting bitcoin are not people who are total no coiners, but people who are lost in the mists of Solana, trapped in the fumes of Ethereum. Right. And what is really unique about Bob is it's a bit, it's the bitcoin focused corner of Ethereum. And so it represents a gateway drug to the wider bitcoin ecosystem.
00:14:14.290 - 00:14:16.250, Speaker B: And that's why we're there.
00:14:16.442 - 00:14:40.434, Speaker C: Yeah. Because with all these new l two s coming up, the question of, like, what is a bitcoin? L two got murky for a second, and part of it is narrative. Like, what is the focus there? What's the team building like? And Alexa and Dom are as strong as they come when it comes to building for bitcoin. So, yeah, very bullish on Bob. Very. See how you guys make the pivot there, which mean that should be soon. So excited to watch how that rolls out.
00:14:40.434 - 00:15:07.594, Speaker C: Excellent. Okay, let's jump into this roll up in this white paper stuff. There's three kind of pieces here. You have bitcoin os that you guys have already kind of announced. This is like, the umbrella thing is, by understanding, you announced Bitsnark Grail today, and I don't know enough about how these pieces go together. So maybe you can hold my hand a little bit and tell me, like, what. What logically makes the most sense to help the user understand these three pieces and how they interconnect.
00:15:07.974 - 00:15:50.084, Speaker B: All right, so let's say we want to be able to build everything on bitcoin. Awesome. A lot of people want to do that, but a lot of people, very often the same people, also don't want to give up on bitcoin's decentralization. And basically, from the very beginning, right, Satoshi came and created bitcoin, and he looked, and God created the earth, and he looked upon it, and he said, behold, it is good. And Satoshi looked upon it and said, behold, there's so much to do. And everyone else was like, oh, I just discovered bitcoin, and I'm here to fix it. And there were so many things, but ultimately, it came down to three things, right? We want to be able to achieve greater scale.
00:15:50.084 - 00:16:09.164, Speaker B: We want to be able to achieve greater functionality, the ability to build basically anything we want on bitcoin. And we want to do both of those things without reducing decentralization. This is the trilemma. How do you. Because if you. It's like. It's like we've got a blanket, and we try to pull it to one of these three corners, and it just sort of gets.
00:16:09.164 - 00:17:06.914, Speaker B: We can't cover the whole thing. And over the last 15 years, it's almost like some parts of the community have actually even given up on the idea that we would ever be able to solve the trilemma. And as a result, as, like, dealing with their cognitive distance, they've started to sort of take the approach that it doesn't really matter. All of this functionality doesn't matter. Scalability doesn't matter or can be solved by lightning network, and none of which has worked. So how can we do this? And the answer is, and this is not a new answer, right? People have been discussing this building in layers or building additional systems based on bitcoin, proof of work since 2009. Right? Satoshi was discussing it, and that's why I say this is a debate that has been raging since forever.
00:17:06.914 - 00:18:07.046, Speaker B: But the technology wasn't available to us to secure additional chains and additional execution environments which would provide us with functionality and scale, but have them secured by bitcoin without impacting bitcoin's security. Scalability. Right. Without changing the block size, without relying on something as imperfect as merge mining. And so what's changing now? And what we're looking to introduce is the ability to take a bunch of information, a bunch of transaction data that happens off chain and prove that it happened off chain without requiring the bitcoin miners to know anything about it, right? And the way we do this is with the zero knowledge proof. And the zero knowledge in this particular case is the zero knowledge of the miners. The first thing that we introduced is bitsnark and bit.
00:18:07.046 - 00:19:02.522, Speaker B: Snark is inspired by BitVM, and it is an optimized system for taking zero knowledge proofs, in this case, snarks, and writing them to bitcoin in such a way that they can be validated. And thus the transactions that are sort of aggregated into those are proved on bitcoin. And then what you get is you get these transactions secured by bitcoin, they become a bitcoin transaction, so they get the full security of bitcoin. So now you're getting scalability plus the ability on in these off chain transactions to add any kind of functionality that you want. But in order to do that, you need these execution environments. And these execution environments are called roll ups, because you take all the information, you roll it up to bitcoin. Bitcoin OS is a system for runoffs.
00:19:02.522 - 00:19:16.330, Speaker B: And the two key components that we've introduced are Bitsnark, which is the verification and validation improving system for the snark proofs, the ZK proofs and Grail, which is the bridging system between bitcoin and the rollups.
00:19:16.522 - 00:19:25.410, Speaker C: Okay, so the big innovation here then is roll ups, which is something that. Well, I would say, and taproot.
00:19:25.442 - 00:20:15.414, Speaker B: Right, well, okay, so the technologies are taproot, which allows us to create bitsnark transactions, which are transactions that can validate snarks or ZK proofs. And then Grail, which is a system for building a bridge using these ZK proofs. The result is rollups. And so rollups is where we want to get to. And with rollups we can basically create. We'll probably start by recreating a lot of what has already been built elsewhere. Right, so you'll have like Ethereum equivalent and Solana equivalent systems being built on bitcoin, but from there we'll continue to see a, a huge amount of innovation.
00:20:15.414 - 00:20:46.124, Speaker B: And that's the door that rollups open. And so when I talk about consolidating right now, we've got a whole bunch of l one s. There's no trustless interaction between them. They have their own consensus and security and tokens, etcetera, etcetera. And what rollups do is allow us to take all of those execution environments because that's what they basically are. They're execution environments bolted onto consensus systems and tokens. Basically just take those execution environments and rebundle them into bitcoin.
00:20:47.544 - 00:21:26.968, Speaker C: Got it? Okay, this will probably be a dumb question, but I'm asking anyway, because the way we've typically thought about l two s currently is, as you just said, like there's a bunch of l one's or side chains, they have their own consensus, and we're trying to figure out how to bridge these things. So like, I give up. Well, I bridge over my bitcoin and as little trust assumptions as possible, I go do a bunch of fun things in la la land. And then when I want to, I can come back over the bridge and no one ideally can tell me no. Does that model change here when it comes to using these pieces or is that still kind of the same mental model? I want to make sure people can.
00:21:27.056 - 00:22:21.144, Speaker B: Grok that it's day and night. So I've spent the last years of my life supporting, building, promoting side chains and side chain and developments on side chain. My view right now is that side chains are minutes away from becoming obsolete technology. And so the side chains that currently exist will either have to upgrade themselves to roll ups or become obsolete or, or they just will become obsolete. And, and the reason is, what rollups give you is instead of being bitcoin's best friend, you are bitcoin. The roll up is secured by bitcoin in the most direct fashion. The transactions are aggregated and turned into rolled up into a bitcoin transaction.
00:22:21.144 - 00:23:01.494, Speaker B: So they get, you know, bitcoin level security on main chain, the ability to move funds. And this is BTC, but also runes and ordinals is now possible in a near trusted setting. And where our goal is and where we will eventually get to is effectively trustless movement. And so the reason we call it bitcoin OS is because what it will feel like to the user, right, and then those users are us in five years, is that all of this functionality is built into bitcoin. But it's all one system, it's not a million different chains. It's a single interoperable, composable system.
00:23:02.074 - 00:23:36.874, Speaker C: Got it. I have a thousand questions figuring out where to go next when it comes to. Probably jump ahead to how it's going to feel to use. Because one of the things that I think made ordinals really pop was that it felt l one. Even though there's another node running, there's an index or all this different stuff, you just send l one transactions. So the, the work behind the scenes is abstracted away when it comes to this kind of things. Is there like a bridge transaction? Does it feel like l one? What's the user flow feel like here?
00:23:37.454 - 00:24:25.424, Speaker B: I think ultimately it will end up feeling like ordinals, because with ordinals you need to have a separate wallet and you need a different setup. But over time, more and more wallets are sort of integrating BTC and ordinals, BTC and ordinals and runes. And ultimately what will happen is that BTC and ordinals and runes and rollups will all be integrated into the same wallet. So the wallets are going to do most of the heavy lifting for the users. At the beginning, it's going to feel, I think probably mostly like using a different chain will feel more similar to using a side chain than using bitcoin. And that's a UX problem. UX problems are hard, and they take time to solve, and they are partly hard because they're a coordination problem.
00:24:25.424 - 00:25:14.670, Speaker B: So because each wallet tries to solve the problem in a slightly different way, there's no consensus between wallets. And because each of the systems then needs to cater to all of these different wallets, the whole thing becomes a mess. So one of the best things that we can do is try and build into the framework tools which will reduce the degree to which UI experiences become idiosyncratic. And one very powerful tool that we're working on is Utxo mapping. So that the Utxo, the private public key pair that you have on bitcoin main chain, will be the same private public key that you use for all of these different systems.
00:25:14.862 - 00:25:26.654, Speaker C: That becomes a powerful interoperability piece where like, you just have to bring in runes and ordinals, anything that's on the. On the l one as far as Utxos maps and carries over to the roll up.
00:25:27.034 - 00:25:45.292, Speaker B: That's right. And what I would expect is, you know, the fact that we're getting these ordinals. Sorry, have ordinals and we have now runes. Right. Right. Now if you look at runes, they're effectively meme coins. And, you know, that's got its place.
00:25:45.292 - 00:26:55.294, Speaker B: But with the introduction of the roll ups, you now get the opportunity to start using them for all kinds of assets. And for me, the most important kind of asset is sort of next gen equity. Right? The ability for a community to have shared equity in some goal that they want to achieve, which may be commercial, maybe it will generate revenue and then to make decisions on the basis of that, distribute revenue, distribute risks and costs, because that becomes a very, very powerful coordination tool around building a bitcoin native economy. Now, in the sort of wider crypto world, we talk about this as Defi and Daos. And I think. I think at the beginning that's what it looks like. But, you know, why on earth, you know, what I've had the privilege for the last three plus years to be part of sovereign, and sovereign is a project which has a community which has shared equity in something it's trying to achieve.
00:26:55.294 - 00:27:24.170, Speaker B: It generates revenue in the form of BTC. It distributes this revenue in the form of BTC. So it's serving the same purpose as a corporation, but it's not a corporation because it's not incorporated anywhere outside of bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only jurisdiction that it exists in. And that's cool. I don't have to deal with lawyers. I don't have to deal with contracts except for smart contracts.
00:27:24.170 - 00:27:46.014, Speaker B: And who wants to deal with dumb contracts, right? I can live truly off grid, right? I'm not just sort of off the electric grid. I'm off the nation state grid. And that's where I would like everyone who would like to be there, which hopefully eventually will be the majority of people, to get off the nation state grid.
00:27:47.074 - 00:28:23.734, Speaker C: Okay. I want to double click on rollups at verifying because I pick up, where does I go? Some people say roll ups close scale. So far, that's maybe another topic. But, like, there's a big topic in rollups in bitcoin that we need an opcode change, which is obviously a contentious thing. We can't even agree on CTV. So when it comes to verifying and not changing bitcoin does this need an upgrade? Doesn't sound like it does. So if so, why doesn't it? And like, is there limitations of this implementation versus if we did get an opcode in the future?
00:28:26.944 - 00:29:18.580, Speaker B: So I'm someone who really wants to see, I'm a bitcoin accelerationist, right? I want to accelerate hyper bitcoinization and I want to accelerate bitcoin. And that means I want to do lots of things with bitcoin that a lot of people find offensive because they just want to store their bitcoin and their ethics up, right? That's it. As opposed to a lot of people who are bitcoin accelerationists. I want to see bitcoin accelerationism not in order so that we can change bitcoin, but so that we never need to change bitcoin. To my mind, what makes bitcoin special? Right, the reason we have bitcoin and everything else is because bitcoin is permaware. Everything else, Ethereum, Solana. That's software, right? Asics are hardware, but there's just one thing which exists in this category, which is neither of those things, which is permaware, which is.
00:29:18.580 - 00:30:02.304, Speaker B: It's totally soft, right? There's no hardware or component required, but it doesn't change. It's not upgraded every six months. It's not a massive code base which nobody understands. It's a law of nature, basically. It's permaware. Now, I think that for bitcoin to continue to be bitcoin and everything else, bitcoin needs to become more like permaware, not less like permaware. So with bitsnark, with bit os, we're deeply focused and we, you know, I'm being able to prove that even now with what bitcoin currently exists, without any changes to consensus, we can basically build anything on bitcoin.
00:30:02.304 - 00:30:35.794, Speaker B: And if we were to ever encounter a wall where. Where it would be proven that we can't do this securely, then maybe I could be persuaded to make, you know, to support an additional consensus change to bitcoin. But my number one criteria for what would persuade me to make consensus change to bitcoin is that it needs to take us closer to that being the last change ever, rather than further away. Right. I want. If we ever make another change, I want it to be the last change ever.
00:30:37.954 - 00:31:02.442, Speaker C: That's a very. It almost seems. I get. I kind of get what you're saying, but it sounds very paradoxical at the same time. It's, um, it's. We don't need changes by default. We have all the tools we need if we use them effectively, but if there's like something that crosses the chasm, it will unlock x amount of things, then make a change.
00:31:02.442 - 00:31:11.096, Speaker C: So I guess the question is, like, what, out of all the things being talked about, do you think we need more changes right now, or do you.
00:31:11.120 - 00:31:45.234, Speaker B: Think we're at a consensus? I don't currently. I think we haven't gotten all the juice that we can out. I would need to see a very compelling reason to introduce a consensus change to bitcoin. It would need to be. And again, I'm an accelerationist, right. I'm not a maxi, I'm not a purist, I'm an accelerationist. But my end goal where I'm trying to accelerate to, is the world is built on bitcoin and the world is built on bitcoin, because bitcoin is the one thing that doesn't change.
00:31:46.654 - 00:31:47.286, Speaker A: Got it.
00:31:47.350 - 00:31:53.502, Speaker C: Okay, so you're not opcat then? We have everything you need for the next few years.
00:31:53.598 - 00:31:59.614, Speaker B: Don't do that. I have yet. I'm not even close to being persuaded. Opcat.
00:32:00.154 - 00:32:00.834, Speaker A: Got it.
00:32:00.914 - 00:32:12.694, Speaker C: Okay, what else are we missing here? Anything that we haven't covered? I've gone through most of my notes, so, like, any. Anything that the people should know about.
00:32:13.434 - 00:32:51.334, Speaker B: I mean, I. There are a lot of things I talk about. I think. Look, I would say. I would say this, right? So my view on bitcoin accelerationism is highly controversial, because bitcoin accelerationism is controversial. And then even within the bitcoin accelerationist world, my particular stance is controversial. And I think I actually have a lot of controversial views in bitcoin because I view bitcoin probably through a different lens than what is common.
00:32:51.334 - 00:33:30.924, Speaker B: Most people think of bitcoin as a. Primarily as. Like a digital token, as a currency is as money. And I think that's true. But I think that that is simply a use case of bitcoin. I don't think that the biggest innovation that occurred with bitcoin was the creation of digital money or decentralized digital money. I think it was something more profound, which was the creation of cryptographic property, property rights which were secured without recourse to violence.
00:33:30.924 - 00:34:22.384, Speaker B: That is, humanity has two periods, right? The period where ultimately your rights were secured by violence, and the period after that. And what bitcoin did is it issued issue ushered in that period where our rights are no longer secured merely by violence. And so that framing changes the way I think about bitcoin and the world. And so I'll give you a sort of a toy example of one of the controversial views that this leads me to. Right. A lot of people hate tokens. They see them as competition for bitcoin, whereas I see them as a necessary complement to bitcoin.
00:34:22.384 - 00:35:18.112, Speaker B: And the reason is I don't think you can have an economy based on a single asset. And I think what makes bitcoin the reserve BTC, the reserve currency of the world, is that it has a native economy built around it, which has all kinds of different assets, like the ones that I was talking about, right? Like sort of like super equity. And I think that having super equity allows communities to come together and to collaborate, and I think allows people to have equity in the things that they're doing in a way which isn't mediated by governments or third parties. I think all of these things are amazing, civilizational, changing things that we don't talk about nearly enough in bitcoin. And as a result, frequently, I think with bitcoin, we're missing the forest for the trees, right. I think the way to think about bitcoin is it's basically another planet with its own economic system, and we need to build everything. And it's.
00:35:18.112 - 00:35:36.880, Speaker B: And what this planet does, right, it's sort of like. Because that's what, where bitcoin is, right. It's not on Earth. It's sort of like in the clouds. It's got its own set of rules, its own community, its own jurisdiction. It enforces those rules by itself without recourse to violence. Amazing stuff.
00:35:36.880 - 00:35:50.124, Speaker B: And we need to build a society and economy. Economy comes first for that world. Otherwise, I think we haven't even begun to explore the true value of bitcoin.
00:35:53.064 - 00:36:17.864, Speaker C: Totally agree. Yeah. Because I've heard you talk quite a few times about building a circular bitcoin economy, which is, that was what's so fascinating about the anti ordinal people is because that was actually one of the bigger circular kinds that we've seen. Now it's in digital assets, and you could say it's scams or shitcoins or whatever, but it's all in BTC. Like the gravity is coming to the asset and the network.
00:36:18.524 - 00:37:17.490, Speaker B: I want to point out something around this. There's different views on where value comes from, right. And for people who know their history, they know that economists sort of went through a whole process of trying to decide where value came from. Where does value come from the use of something? Does value come from how expensive it was to make something? Does value come from supply and demand? Right? Each of these, right? So you've got utility value, you've got marginal value, you've got production value. And the reason it's so ambiguous where value for a thing comes from is because it's actually ambiguous, right? Value is ultimately a subjective thing. Now, people who have a utility view tend to be rationalists, right? Tend to be modernists, tend to have a mechanistic view of the world, right? Tend to be into austrian economics. They have of these different things.
00:37:17.490 - 00:38:22.684, Speaker B: They sort of settled on utility value, right? And so they look at something like ordinals and they say, there's no utility there. It's not real, it's a scam, it's nonsense, it's spam. And you know what? They're right from a utility perspective. All of this meme coin, crypto, blah, blah, blah, it's nonsense. The question is, what are we building and for whom, right? If you believe in freedom, if you believe in sovereignty, then you are making a huge sacrifice. And the sacrifice that you're making is you're basically saying, I'm going to support, not just allow, but I'm going to support other people's right to do stupid shit, right? That is the basis of a free society. Because the vast majority of what people do is dumb shit, right? People have crap opinions, which they copy from other people, and they've stupid emotions.
00:38:22.684 - 00:39:10.404, Speaker B: Look, we're a bunch of monkeys running around with cell phones, right? Buying nfts. We're morons. As a species, we're morons, and we're pushed forward by the rare monkey who isn't an actual moron. And what freedom does is it gives the rare, unusual monkey who isn't an actual moron, the ability to change the world without getting stoned to death. So what are nfts and ordinals and all these? They are expressions of the fact that we have created an environment, or are seeking to create an environment where the rare intelligent monkey can do his work, right? And that is not a beautiful idea. It's an ugly, horrible, terrible, sacrificial idea, but it's reality.
00:39:13.164 - 00:39:30.104, Speaker C: I have nothing to add there. That was beautifully said. Two last questions. One, the obligatory when so you dropped all this stuff? White paper dropped 3 hours ago. It will be in the description for people. What's the rough EtA for seeing these things and being able to play with them?
00:39:30.844 - 00:40:10.210, Speaker B: We are pretty close to having a Devnet, which doesn't have nearly all the features that we want we expect to. So follow the space, follow BTC OS on Twitter, or go to bitcoin s dot build and follow us there because stuff's dropping. And by the end of this year, we expect everything will have dropped. There's gonna be a mic drop. And the mic drop is basically all right, everyone, pack up your bags. Ethereum was a testnet. Solana was a slightly less good testnet.
00:40:10.210 - 00:40:12.694, Speaker B: But time to come back to the mothership.
00:40:13.834 - 00:40:31.604, Speaker C: Yep, bitcoin is gravity. It all comes back to bitcoin. Okay, last question. I want to get your take on this. It's going to be a left turn, but you're mentioning this like permaware idea. Bitcoin is forever. And there's a topic right now about minor centralization.
00:40:31.604 - 00:40:51.504, Speaker C: Again, the current thing is about like payouts and mining pools. How do you view, because this is such a difficult social coordination issue and there's economics involved and incentives. How do you view the minor centralization issue? As it stands.
00:40:53.724 - 00:41:49.888, Speaker B: It'S a complicated topic, but I'm not really concerned right now. The worst thing about proof of work is that it has industrial footprint, so you can find out where it is, and significant returns to scale so that you actually do bring large mining centers. Right. The one advantage that I will hand to proof of stake is that it's more invisible, more sort of hard to locate where it's happening. That said, in practice we still haven't seen mining centralization actually become a problem. And that's because the big advantage that proof of work has over proof of stake is that miners are a bitch. Being a miner sucks.
00:41:49.888 - 00:42:33.284, Speaker B: You're basically a feudal slave working in the field. You get to eat only what you produce and you live day to day. And that makes that the fact that it's such a cutthroat, competitive environment where you're constantly burning capital, right. In order to make some marginal profit means that true centralization or managing to corner that market is not possible. Highly competitive markets are decentralized by nature. So unless something changes there, I don't see right now any indication for worry.
00:42:34.424 - 00:42:44.124, Speaker C: Excellent. Well, this has been a fantastic breakdown of some new cool shit you guys are working on. Any closing thoughts before we bring this to a close?
00:42:46.464 - 00:43:12.844, Speaker B: As early as you think you are to bitcoin, you're even earlier than that. The bitcoin economy hasn't even started getting built. And I think that's where sort of the next big narrative is going to come from. The next big excitement is going to come from. The next big growth spurt for bitcoin is going to come from. We're just getting started. We're really, our foot isn't even out the door yet.
00:43:14.304 - 00:43:28.950, Speaker C: I love it. Love it. Yeah, it's interesting. When I talk to normies, they have so much unit bias is definitely an issue. They think they want to get into some other bullshit tokens because they can buy more whole tokens. And I'm like, that's not the way I think about it. But, you know, everyone's on the.
00:43:28.982 - 00:43:32.278, Speaker B: What did I say? Monkeys. We are monkeys.
00:43:32.326 - 00:43:33.074, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:43:35.094 - 00:43:37.654, Speaker B: I want six. I want six.
00:43:37.694 - 00:43:47.274, Speaker C: Not one. I have one piece of pepperoni on the pizza. This is not enough to sustain me. I can't do it.
00:43:47.834 - 00:43:48.402, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:48.498 - 00:44:01.374, Speaker C: No. Yeah. Well said. All right, iago, thanks again, as always for coming on. Always a good chat, everybody. I'll links below to all the stuff we talked about, but until next time.
00:44:02.114 - 00:44:03.402, Speaker B: All right, thanks, man.

00:45:10.230 - 00:45:24.182, Speaker D: It's gone. We playing the long game to the black rock chains with the rocks paid off from the blockchain going up high octane so we up in here like Poman, making big noise, big money. Go play with your kid toys. You funny. I'm counting my bitcoin. We up and we been gone. It's gone.
00:45:24.182 - 00:45:37.374, Speaker D: Planned it out and we did this purposefully, panning out like the kitchen currently. It's like surgery weigh is earning me a nurse's salary for cryptocurrency. I'm on a vacation drinking coconuts while wearing polka dots. This ain't no hocus pocus. Listen up and learn. It's gone.
