00:00:00.360 - 00:00:34.928, Speaker A: Is Solana a bitcoin? L two, is there even things useful on Solana that we as bitcoiners can use? Well, a good chunk of the community and some builders are making the case that that is exactly true. And I think I tend to agree. It's a good execution layer. It has native stablecoins from the big players and a few other things that we'll talk about. But first, what is up, y'all? Welcome back to the built on Bitcoin podcast. I am your humble host, Jacob Brown. And you know what we do here.
00:00:34.928 - 00:01:19.798, Speaker A: I'm talking to all the best bitcoin founders I can find, kind of giving you the alpha of all the cool shit coming to bitcoin across the entire ecosystem. I take a very broad definition of what that means. And today I have the co founders of Atomic on the show. Silvie and Adam are building an atomic swap protocol that you go from bitcoin in both of its flavors, l one, and lightning, into Solana assets. So currently, that's Seoul and USDC, and they're going to be supporting more assets and more chains like EVM very soon. But what's interesting here is the way they've constructed this protocol. It has very few trust assumptions, not nearly as many as you have in a typical bridge.
00:01:19.798 - 00:02:00.682, Speaker A: And because they're atomic, the trade either goes through and you get your assets, or you can get a refund and get your assets back. So there's not much risk here. So that's what we talked about in this episode. We talk about what they're building and how they built it. We talk about the differences between atomic swaps and bridges, as people commonly hear about them. The benefits of being able to swap into different assets from bitcoin into any of these other chains. What they're cooking kind of on near term roadmap of not just for the service, but their SDK and being able to effortlessly put this tech into wallets, which is fantastic and a bunch of other stuff.
00:02:00.682 - 00:02:15.304, Speaker A: So this one was a great episode. I think you're going to enjoy this one. So, without further ado, let me take a step back and bring on this fantastic episode with Sylvie and Adam, the co founders of atomic.
00:02:20.684 - 00:02:23.424, Speaker B: Welcome to built on bitcoin.
00:02:37.964 - 00:02:40.764, Speaker A: Sobie. Adam, how are you yesterday?
00:02:41.264 - 00:02:43.364, Speaker C: Pretty good. Can't complain.
00:02:43.904 - 00:02:45.712, Speaker B: Yeah, good, good. All good.
00:02:45.848 - 00:02:46.924, Speaker C: How about you?
00:02:47.584 - 00:02:58.424, Speaker A: I am fantastic. Fantastic. Yeah. Lots, lots going on in bitcoin. Exciting time. And as always, though, talking to founders, building. Cool stuff.
00:02:58.424 - 00:03:24.404, Speaker A: So that's what we're here to do today. And, yeah, I think. You know, I like to typically start with a broad question about how people got into bitcoin. Everyone comes here for different reasons, which has been so fascinating to me, you know, freedom tech or purchasing power or f the government, whatever it is so curious for both of you guys. Maybe I could start with you, Sophie. What was the thing that drew you into the crypto space in bitcoin?
00:03:25.424 - 00:04:00.516, Speaker C: That was 2018. I worked in Southern California for a fintech company there, and apparently all of my colleagues in the engineering department went completely crazy. They all bought bitcoin. They all told me I need to buy it. They even asked our CEO if he can pay them in bitcoin, which he unfortunately didn't do back then. But that was basically how I got into bitcoin, because then I looked at the white paper, as german as I am, of course I wanted to know what I'm getting myself into. I read through it.
00:04:00.516 - 00:04:33.044, Speaker C: I thought, it's super interesting. I come from a banking and fintech background, so very traditional. And, yeah, I was just like, wow, this is a super intriguing concept. Bought bitcoin back then, didn't really touch it again until I met Adam in October 21. And, yeah, then Adam basically dragged me over to the dark side, bitcoin and crypto. And here I am two years later, still going strong.
00:04:33.544 - 00:04:34.464, Speaker A: Love it.
00:04:34.624 - 00:04:35.884, Speaker C: My bitcoin story.
00:04:36.784 - 00:04:39.404, Speaker A: Awesome. And what about you, Adam?
00:04:40.224 - 00:06:06.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, for me, it was kind of a roller coaster to get to bitcoin eventually when it started in 2017, back in that bull run when, like, the Ethereum went crazy and you had all those icos and shitcoins popping all over the place. And back then I started mining. I started mining ethereum, mined a little of that. But then eventually, of course, I didn't sell at the top, so I didn't huddle it all the way down and then eventually, years later, turn it into bitcoin, of course. But, yeah, I mean, I was a lot into these shitcoins back then until I eventually figured out that, okay, maybe this is not something that makes sense, maybe it's much easier and much more how to say it secure to just hold a little bitcoin and don't have to care about which coin you buy and when you need to sell it and all these things. And eventually I kind of gravitated towards being kind of bitcoin maxi, even though that word has, like, a big, bad connotation currently. But, yeah, so that's why I call myself currently bitcoin harmonic averages.
00:06:06.024 - 00:06:07.664, Speaker B: So.
00:06:10.684 - 00:06:18.416, Speaker A: That'S probably the most poetic way, I've heard someone describe themselves as a bitcoiner. A bitcoin what? Bitcoin. Harmonic what?
00:06:18.560 - 00:06:27.924, Speaker B: Yeah, harmonic averages. You have. You know, you have a different type of averages, and, like, harmonic averages is one of the types, so. So I settled for that one.
00:06:28.624 - 00:06:49.154, Speaker A: I love it. I mean, I'm gonna help you meme this into reality to make it a thing that we start using and calling it in the common narrative. That's awesome. Okay. So quick to level set. Sylvie, you were sort of a fintech background, so you were kind of in the web to traditional space. And then, Adam, were you.
00:06:49.154 - 00:06:53.478, Speaker A: What was your background that way? Like, are you more entrepreneurial? What were you doing?
00:06:53.646 - 00:07:32.294, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, sorry. So, yeah, I forgot to mention it, but, yes, so I was doing full stack programming before, so I was a programmer. I'm still a programmer. So, yeah, first. At first, I just saw it as, like, number go up, just gonna get rich quick. And then I was studying also more and more the technology behind it, and that was what was fascinating me a lot about bitcoin and especially about lightning. I guess lightning really got me into believing that bitcoin could really be used as a payment layer for the Internet.
00:07:32.934 - 00:07:49.582, Speaker A: Yep, makes sense. Okay. And then starting to go into the startup journey, he said that Adam brought you to the dark side in October of 2021. So I'm assuming this was not atomic, that you guys started back then. This is something else. So what were you guys building?
00:07:49.758 - 00:07:59.214, Speaker C: No, back then, we had multiple iterations. I think the very first thing we started to build was actually a lightning point of sale system.
00:07:59.254 - 00:08:05.142, Speaker B: Oh, no, no. You need to speak about what we did before that, why we met in the first place there.
00:08:05.238 - 00:08:47.600, Speaker C: So how did Adam and I meet in the first place? We met at an accelerator program, which was focused on co founder matching in Berlin. And, yeah, back then, I had a very genius idea to turn or to build, like, a tinder for fashion. And back then, I always thought, okay, Adam is probably not interested in that idea, because he was, like, the crypto guy. And then at some point, we started to talk, and then he told me, oh, Sylvie, that's basically a pile of cash lying in the corner. Like, women love to go shopping. And if there's, like, something that you can do it even more in an easier way online, that's even better. That's basically a money printing machine.
00:08:47.600 - 00:09:32.954, Speaker C: And then Adam and I started working together, and we eventually came to the point, oh, maybe that's not the best idea that we were working on, but we realized that we're actually quite a good pair in terms of working together. And, yeah, then we looked into our backgrounds and we're just like, okay, what else could we do? And then, yeah, Adam basically told me about bitcoin lightning. And yeah, I was fire. I was just like, wow, this is amazing. I've also lived in the US before where the credit card fees are even higher and stuff. And back then we were just like, okay, we're going to revolutionize the world. In Berlin, we're going to offer bitcoin lightning payments in every single bar, in every single kiosk, everywhere.
00:09:32.954 - 00:10:33.482, Speaker C: Unfortunately, we got a bit of a reality check, so it wasn't as easy. But we actually ended up offering our payments for quite a while at some local bars. They're not offering it anymore, but, yeah, it was really cool and it brought me, for sure, deeper into the space. We then had several iterations afterwards, and then we basically built, or Adam built a system where companies based in Europe could pay in euros and then we would pay out USDC. While we were working on that, Adam needed to find a way to bridge between Polygon, where our service provider was built on, and bitcoin. And yeah, there was Ren Bridge, but unfortunately Renbridge went down due to FTX. And, yeah, then he needed to find another way and he did not really find one, so he decided to invent it himself.
00:10:33.482 - 00:10:35.574, Speaker C: And atomic was born.
00:10:36.194 - 00:11:13.734, Speaker A: Okay, so I want to jump into where atomic is, but before I want to double click on how you guys view lightning quick, like as an overview, real quick, because I see it in two camps right now. So a lot of fud about lightning, you know, scaling issues, not going to work with high on chain fees, a bunch of reasons, channel management. But when I double click on a lot of those people, they don't really use lightning that much. They haven't really given it like a proper shot. It works pretty well in a lot of cases. And the payment failure rate's gone down, in my experience. And then the other side is like, there's all these problems have.
00:11:13.734 - 00:11:28.804, Speaker A: Have solutions. It's just a. An issue of time. We'll find the right solutions, these problems. So where are you guys currently at? Obviously, you leverage lightning heavily, but yeah. How do you guys feel right now about the current narrative around lightning?
00:11:30.024 - 00:12:02.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, some of those points are fair, actually. The criticism is in some cases, not all cases, warranted. But, like, the thing I see is that, like, look, lightning is the only l two on bitcoin that we currently have. And that is, that is working to some extent or like, I mean, it works really well for me. Right? Like, I almost never had a problem using Phoenix on my phone. Yeah. Which is.
00:12:02.000 - 00:12:38.814, Speaker B: Which is a lightning wallet. Yeah. So, like, okay, they are far fair criticism, but, like, okay, criticize, but then try to come up with something better, and then, like, I will. I will take it seriously, because, I mean, just bashing lightning doesn't help anyone if you don't try to solve those problems. So, yeah, I mean, if those problems have a solution, then go implement those solutions, or, like, propose those solutions for lightning. And if they don't have a solution on lightning, if you think, like, lightning is, like, not gonna work, then just propose your own solution. But, like, a lot of those guys actually, they don't have anything up their sleeve.
00:12:38.814 - 00:12:46.294, Speaker B: They just say, oh, this is shit. This doesn't work. But, yeah, I mean, what. What. What can we do, right? I mean, the best we have now.
00:12:46.334 - 00:12:52.190, Speaker A: So, yeah, and this is Twitter, so, like, everyone's trying to, like, get engagement, get clicks.
00:12:52.222 - 00:12:52.430, Speaker B: It's.
00:12:52.462 - 00:13:00.430, Speaker A: It's easy to critique. It's hard to build. Uh, so expect them to come with solutions. That's a high bar. There's no. There's no chance. Even though it's.
00:13:00.430 - 00:13:01.834, Speaker A: Even though it's pragmatic.
00:13:02.134 - 00:13:06.634, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I agree. Yeah. I mean, that's swear, after all. Yeah.
00:13:06.954 - 00:13:17.014, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, awesome. Cool. Then let's jump in. I want to start double clicking on atomic, so, yeah, give us a high level overview. What is atomic? What are you guys building?
00:13:17.914 - 00:13:49.608, Speaker C: So, atomic is a cross chain interoperability protocol. You could see it as an alternative to a bridge, for example, where you can swap between bitcoin. Currently, we support on chain and lightning, and on the other end, Solana, Sol and USDC. We are utilizing a bitcoin relayer and atomic swaps, so therefore, our tech works fundamentally different from bridges. But I'll keep that over to Adam to explain it to you in a more detailed way.
00:13:49.736 - 00:14:44.384, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw you had Killian from bolts on the podcast recently. Did you? Yeah. So, I mean, it's kind of similar to what vault is doing for bitcoin and liquid and lightning, but we do it more cross chain, so we do it also, like on Solana, and we're planning to go also expand to ethereum and other evms. So we use submarine swaps the same as they do, which are kind of atomic swaps. So that means the two parties can be sure that the trade either executes in full, so both parties get what they want. Order trade doesn't execute at all, but we are building also on top of that, since we are operating on blockchains, that I have more programmability. So like Bolt is just operating on liquid bitcoin and lightning.
00:14:44.384 - 00:15:51.854, Speaker B: And now they also will do rootstock. Generally they are operating not during complete change. We operate on these smart chains or ethereum, so we get more expressiveness in the smart contract, what we can write in a smart contract. And this allows us to basically create a smart contract which acts as a bitcoin lite client. So a bitcoin lite client is a client of bitcoin blockchain, which instead of verifying full bitcoin blocks, which could be up to four megabytes in size and contain like a lot of transactions, and check all the signatures, you instead just purely rely on miners behaving honestly. And you can with a big certainty be able to say, okay, like this is a valid blockchain because miners put so much work into mining those blocks that they would probably not try to fool someone because it's not profitable for them. This allows us to verify bitcoin blockchain trustlessly on a different chain.
00:15:51.854 - 00:16:30.284, Speaker B: We then use this primitive to create contracts that are similar to atomic swap contracts as like summary swaps. But the big advantage of those is that you only need one on chain transaction on bitcoin. So for atomic swaps, for the regular ones, you generally need two transactions on both blockchains. But this is like pretty wasteful, especially on bitcoin, to like. Yeah, I mean, it's much better if you can just do one transaction instead of two. And this bitcoin lite client running on Solana or in Ethereum allows us to do just that and then make these swaps that much efficient.
00:16:30.944 - 00:16:52.764, Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to try and rehash some of this, make sure I get it correct. So jump in if I'm wrong on any of this. We mentioned atomic swaps. So for people that know, it's a kind of swap that has a pass fail. So either the swap will go as intended or it will revert and you won't lose new funds. A submarine swap is part is on chain, part is off chain. That's the definition of a submarine swap.
00:16:52.764 - 00:16:54.144, Speaker A: Is that all correct so far?
00:16:55.284 - 00:16:58.436, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Correct.
00:16:58.620 - 00:17:26.394, Speaker A: Okay. And then you mentioned one of the bigger providers that does something similar is bolts, and they do one for one, similar assets. So BTC and flavors of BTC, main chain lightning liquid, soon to be rootstock. So not doing assets of different values, for example. And that's where you guys are different. And you have this term cross train interoperability protocol. Is that the word you used? Yeah.
00:17:26.394 - 00:17:43.908, Speaker A: Currently you can go from Lightning BTC into SOL USDC, but there's no reason you can't do a wide variety of assets because at the protocol layer, it's just another token that you could swap into. It just make sense to do stablecoins into BTC. So far all this is good.
00:17:44.086 - 00:18:11.684, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, just one point is that we don't just do lightning, and for lightning we just use subrace because there is no transaction on bitcoin blockchain anyway. So that works fine. But where our approach of using a bitcoin lite client shines is when you do bitcoin on chain to solana swaps. And that's where we are able to offer a much cheaper alternative to regular atomic swaps.
00:18:11.994 - 00:18:30.306, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. And then cool. So that's all good. I think that's a good overview. One thing that kind of, it's weird to me when I first hear about it, I'm not sure how to reconcile it. Is bridging and atomic swaps like at face value, atomic swaps seem like a better way to do these kind of transactions.
00:18:30.306 - 00:18:38.854, Speaker A: So is there limitations in atomic swaps? What can bridges do that atomic swaps can't? Like help me like level set against these two things?
00:18:39.884 - 00:19:45.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so bridging in a sense of like how most of the Defi landscape uses it, is that you have a token on one chain and then you create a rep version of that same token on the other chain. So easy example of that is. And then like, not like is a custodial RebtC WBtC on Ethereum. Right? You send your bitcoin to bitgo and they mint some web BTC for you. There are many different ways how you can do it in a more decentralized way, where you have a federation of nodes that guard the funds that are locked up in a big multi sig of them, and then they cooperatively mint wrapped version of bitcoin on a different chain. Bridging is wrapping the token so you can use it on different chain. And then more like a cross chain swap is like what we do where you directly swap from one token on one chain, so be it bitcoin to a different token on a different chain.
00:19:45.494 - 00:21:00.076, Speaker B: There is no rep version of this bitcoin anywhere. Like a big advantage of that is that if you have a rep bitcoin, you need to trust the underlying bridge technology for the full time. You are holding that rib PPC, because you're ultimately dependent on the fact that there is some real bitcoin backing the web PTC that you have in your wallet. And sure, you can just use it for trade and that you don't need to care about that much, but still you have some exposure. And with atomic swaps, you can basically just get rid of this rep token completely and purely swap between bitcoin and other assets. There is a limitation of that, that you cannot use this bitcoin asset as like collateral for DeFi lending and those kind of things. But we also have an idea how we can solve that by basically leveraging dlcs, this gridlock contracts on top of bitcoin, whereby you lock up your bitcoin as a collateral, native bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain, and then you're able to basically borrow against it in USDC on a different blockchain.
00:21:00.076 - 00:21:10.384, Speaker B: And this can all work thanks to our lite client again, which is able to verify that you correctly locked up this bitcoin in a DLC contract.
00:21:11.884 - 00:21:47.184, Speaker A: Got it. And then it sounds like one of the benefits to bridging or how do I word this? Like when you look at USDC on Solana, you have an issuer of that token, which is circle. They have direct support into Solana and they issue it. A bridge kind of acts like that as well, which is like some kind of trust assumptions. And once you bridge in, they create the token. So it wasn't previously in existence. And you have this hopefully one to one back to whatever you're bridging in.
00:21:47.184 - 00:22:00.764, Speaker A: So a bridge at some level can be a way to bring a token into existence that an atomic swap can only swap into a token that currently exists on the chain of choice. Do I have that right?
00:22:01.424 - 00:22:09.272, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Yeah. That's a very good short version of how it works.
00:22:09.448 - 00:22:29.464, Speaker A: Perfect. Okay, excellent. Then let's start dancing around how to use this then. So you have this interesting trustless, non custodial way to swap into different tokens. Who is the user for this thing? Who is the average person? Why would they use atomic? What are they doing with it?
00:22:30.004 - 00:23:50.084, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's certainly people that care a lot about not holding their own keys, not being too exposed to any counterparty risk at all. Because, I mean, the alternative, and for example, Solana is a great example, because there is no trustless alternative other than us. Your other alternative is basically go through a centralized exchange and deposit BDC and get Solana out, or to go through multiple bridges through Ethereum and then eventually into Solana, which then, of course, you pay a lot in gas fees on Ethereum for real world usage. We've seen, like, many different use cases from people just swapping from Solana to lightning, and then lightning to Solana back to what it looks like trading. And we had sandwich swap from Solana to bitcoin to just buy ordeal on bitcoin. Or we had one guy who swapped to bitcoin to mint an ordinal collection there. So, yeah, there are many, many possible use cases and many users who might be interested in having a trustless alternative to centralized exchanges.
00:23:51.064 - 00:24:15.638, Speaker A: Got it. And do you have any polls on which one is more popular right now? Because one thing I'm always curious about is people talk a lot about stable coins in bitcoin land that could get you out of the volatility of bitcoin, for example. But there's not a lot of stable coins in the bitcoin ecosystem. You have to go up to a layer, typically. And so I've seen Solana be a good. Some bitcoiners are liking Solana for that reason. Jump over to USDC.
00:24:15.638 - 00:24:35.074, Speaker A: This is before all the craziness currently, where it seems like things are going a little while over there, but do you have any polls on our bitcoin is jumping over and holding into USCC because they like Solana? Or are more people on Solana coming over to do djen things on bitcoin? Or have price exposure to bitcoin? Like, any pulse on that?
00:24:35.524 - 00:24:40.664, Speaker B: So you mean like directionality of the swaps, right?
00:24:40.964 - 00:24:42.292, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:24:42.468 - 00:25:02.264, Speaker B: Yeah. I can actually quickly check that we have all that in a database, but I need to get it out from there. So if you can, for a moment, like, let Sylvie talk, I will just quickly get you this data.
00:25:02.694 - 00:25:12.470, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I have more questions, but nothing specific. Just in a second. Do you have any thoughts on anything we just discussed? Sobi, maybe?
00:25:12.502 - 00:25:59.304, Speaker C: One more thought from my side. In terms of the target group, I think it's really defi power users, people definitely who know how to navigate this whole world. It's definitely not necessarily newbies for now. I think that could be an interesting stance for the future once we bring the UX and the UI really to a level where it's super easy to use. So far, people who are familiar with bitcoin and everything already tell us all the time, oh, wow, this is so smooth. It's amazing what you have built there. And it's actually quite cool to get this feedback because you're always in the trenches and building, of course, Adam does the heavy lifting because I don't code, but there's also a bunch of stuff to do on the business side.
00:25:59.304 - 00:26:09.124, Speaker C: So it's actually, it's really cool to hear the user feedback and having people coming back to us and tell us, hey, it's really cool what you have built there. Like, I love it.
00:26:09.824 - 00:26:50.074, Speaker A: Yeah. And actually, on that topic, because I've gotten in some hot water over the past day by talking about custodial lightning, and especially because you have more of a traditional background, not super in the woods, technically. Like, Adam's gonna be the guy who's like, let's build it non custodially, let's build it trustlessly. But he's the one leaning into the headache. The hard part of banging your hang against the wall, trying to figure this out, because doing it custodially is much easier. But from your view, when you think about from a product perspective or what to build, how is that kind of dance of leaning into doing it non custodial versus custodial, the benefits and trade offs to both?
00:26:51.424 - 00:27:53.624, Speaker C: That might be a bit of a, let's say, non traditional stance, but I believe in the future, people won't care like the mass market user, they won't care about if something is like custodial or non custodial, in my opinion. I believe that as long as you can offer people a solution that is very easy to access, very easy to use. Let's say, for example, atomic would be built in, into wallets already. So for example, you can use, even right now, you can use atomic in your phantom wallet, for example, because fantom supports both bitcoin and solana. And in that case, I strongly believe that people wouldn't move their coins outside of their wallet if they have a solution where they can swap within the wallet. So I think in the future it will all be about convenience. Of course, you will always have people who care more about having a non custodial solution and really being the real owner of your coins.
00:27:53.624 - 00:28:05.904, Speaker C: My personal stance is that in the future, that's not really interesting anymore to the mass market user because it's basically just something that they don't necessarily see and probably are also not super interested in.
00:28:06.604 - 00:28:40.096, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, yeah. Ideally, it should be totally abstracted away, and probably just because of ease of use, a lot of the users are going to start custodial. And as I was talking with some other people earlier, like, the Bennett will be great is if a wallet will be like, hey, you have over $500 in your wallet. This is custodial. Maybe you want to spin out over to this thing, and you can just, like, push it to Phoenix. I think that's a great middle ground, but, yeah, I think that's totally right.
00:28:40.096 - 00:28:49.004, Speaker A: Like, the user should be using sats as money, and the rest is just kind of, like, frictionless and abstracted away. Adam?
00:28:49.624 - 00:29:18.862, Speaker B: Yeah. If I made, I may add into that, I think that's a very fair point of, like, having some amounts in a custodial way and then periodically withdrawing them. And I think you can. You can create, again, actually, like. Like, based on this. You can even create, like, an ad solution whereby you just have. Have a lightning channel where you, like, receive the sets, or, like, when you dCa into.
00:29:18.862 - 00:29:45.238, Speaker B: Into bitcoin. Right. You receive sets there. Once your channel fills up, you just do, like, a trustless swap to on chain or to liquid or wherever, and then you can hold your funds there, which is, like, even better than, like, having a custodial and not custodial, but, like. Yeah, again, like, there is some additional complexity with that. But, I mean, you can do the similar of, like, having custodial periodically, like, withdrawing.
00:29:45.286 - 00:30:15.064, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think it'd be cool to have, like, an exploding balance where, like, if you don't touch it for a while, it sweeps over to non custodial, and then if that doesn't move, it sweeps over to, like, on chain or something like, that could be kind of cool. It's like a failsafe because, like, I have, like, moon wallet, and it's just, like, I don't even. I can't remember a thing. I don't know where it's at. I got, like, I have probably $50 just locked there. And it would be cool if I could just, like, have a toggle where it's like. Yeah, that's gonna sweep into this backup lightning balance if it sits for too long or something.
00:30:16.044 - 00:30:47.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that. That. That is certainly interesting. Like, there is. I think I was. I was thinking about this a lot as well, of, like, how you can try to make lightning very user friendly, but every time it falls back to how do you determine which amount of funds are actually not needed for the user to spend right now, which amount you can offload into on chain, and in best case, do it in such a way that the user doesn't even realize that. So do it on the background automatically.
00:30:47.294 - 00:30:51.244, Speaker B: I think if you can solve this, that would be huge.
00:30:52.104 - 00:31:03.280, Speaker A: Yep. Yep. Okay. Jumping back into our previous discussion about flows. Yeah. Who's sending what where?
00:31:03.472 - 00:31:34.414, Speaker B: Yeah. So like, it's interesting, but actually, like, a huge majority of the volume is actually going to bitcoin. So from Solana to bitcoin and it's around like 80, 80%. We can also look maybe at like, how many of the swaps are actually lightning and how many are on chain, which I think is actually almost like 50 50.
00:31:34.994 - 00:31:44.864, Speaker A: So 80% are going from Solana to somewhere in bitcoin. And the only token supported right now is USDC. Do you guys also support soul?
00:31:45.024 - 00:31:47.328, Speaker B: Yeah, we also support soul. They're both. Both.
00:31:47.456 - 00:31:54.232, Speaker A: Okay. And so people are going from either Seoul or USDC into 40% lightning, 40% on chain.
00:31:54.288 - 00:31:57.880, Speaker B: Roughly, yes, yes, pretty much, yeah.
00:31:57.992 - 00:31:58.736, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:31:58.880 - 00:32:06.084, Speaker B: It's roughly the same. I can even, like, go as far as tell you, like, which, which token is usually swapped.
00:32:07.704 - 00:32:24.956, Speaker A: Interesting. I mean, it's interesting, but I wouldn't say I'm shocked. Like, uh, everyone's coming to bitcoin right now, so especially before runes. Like, I. I think, uh, I wonder if people are like, jumping and trying to like, ride the degen wave or whatever's gonna happen in the next, you know, two weeks when the halving happens and runes happens.
00:32:25.140 - 00:32:26.784, Speaker C: I mean, ten days, right?
00:32:27.684 - 00:32:42.494, Speaker A: The countdown. The countdown. We'll see what the miners do. We'll see if we can actually land on 420 and like, do it for the meme factor or if they're gonna mess it up and be too quick and land on the 19th. Fingers crossed. Yeah, fingers crossed. Unplug your machines, please, guys.
00:32:42.494 - 00:33:17.860, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to have a few questions. That kind of. They'll be left turns each time probably, but double clicking on trust assumptions here. Like, is there anywhere in the stack when I'm using this product that I'm trusting someone or is it fully, is there no risk in the sense, like, speaking of atomic swaps, like, I'll either get the trade or it will fail and get my money back. Like, what's the risk? Where's the trust here?
00:33:18.012 - 00:34:20.362, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, as with everything, there is some amount of trust, if not in anything, then in the code you're using. But above that, like, atomic swaps, for them to work, they require both chains to, like, be able to confirm transactions. And this is actually an issue we had, like recently of Solana with network being so congested that the transactions were not landing. So we are working on like, fixing that. But yeah, that's in one way. Like a way how if, I mean, because the whole atomic swap constructions, they work in an assumption that you can get your transaction confirmed in some amount of time, that's not happening, then that's an issue. Then the other trust assumptions you have is the bitcoin lite client assumption, which is that you trust that there is no big miner just trying to fool our lite client on Solana or on Ethereum.
00:34:20.362 - 00:35:12.443, Speaker B: Well, I mean, the great advantage of this is that it's very expensive to fool it. So, I mean, basically, as a miner, if you do that, you're basically forfeiting your reward that you would get from the block otherwise, which now is like six, six BDC. So, like, faking one block will basically cost you six BDC in revenue that you could have had. So, yeah, if we're looking for three or two confirmations, which is what we usually use, it would cost an attacker like 18 BTC to spoof it. And then we're getting into the thing that, okay, this is not economical at all. So this is not very economical attack to do on the protocol.
00:35:13.263 - 00:35:26.862, Speaker A: And this attack vector is basically the three, two, 1% attack, right? So, like, the lite clients just following bitcoin core, and a minor attack in the network would be the same attack vector. Or is it more nuanced than that?
00:35:27.038 - 00:36:53.194, Speaker B: It's a bit more nuanced, because, yes, the assumption is if there is at least one honest relayer. So relayer is actually the party that's submitting the blockaders to the bitcoin lite client running on Solana, you need 51% of bitcoin hash rate to basically overrun the honest chain. But in case there is no honest party, which is also, that's probably very unlikely to happen, because the honest party, in the end, could also be the party doing the swap. So if you're doing the swap, you can make sure that you synchronize the bitcoin lite client to the block that you see as the highest work, basically. So the longest chain. So, yeah, in that case, if there is at least one honest relayer, you need 51% of bitcoin hashrate. Otherwise, it costs you, as I said, six BDC per spoof dog, with no guarantee that there is no relayer who is honest and basically renders all your work useless because he will just sync it to the latest main chain header, and then all the money you spend on mining those fake blogs is basically gone.
00:36:54.974 - 00:37:05.154, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. And then left turn number one. So supported assets. Right now, what do you guys have on the network that people can use?
00:37:05.774 - 00:37:14.554, Speaker C: Right now we have bitcoin on chain and lightning, and Solana, Sol and USDC and we're also planning to go live on Ethereum soon.
00:37:15.374 - 00:37:35.194, Speaker A: Okay, so two networks currently, I guess three networks currently, two BTC ones and then Seoul and BTC. Seoul and USCC currently, yep. And then you said EVM is coming soon. What's the rollout plan there? Are you gonna start with the same kind of like Ethan stable coins?
00:37:36.714 - 00:38:04.340, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess that, I mean, like, so looking at like the torch and which is like the biggest in bitcoin and Ethereum cross chain swaps, like the majority of their volume is basically ETH or stables on ETH. So we'll probably go that, go that way. Yeah, I feel like there is a lot of volume, a lot of potential that we can tap into. So we will begin. We will start with that, I think.
00:38:04.452 - 00:38:18.984, Speaker A: Last couple questions. So you said you're launching EVM. You used the word smart change, which I think is a nice little branding. What's on the roadmap for the next six or twelve months? What are you guys cooking, as the kids say?
00:38:19.804 - 00:39:07.026, Speaker B: Yeah, we certainly want to, as we said, deploy on Ethereum and tap into that huge volume there and we will see how it goes. Also trying to support some more protocols on the bitcoin side. So we already know how to, for example, add support for liquid as well. So if we see like a lot of demand there, I would certainly be looking into more into that. And another thing. Yeah, we are like, I am quite a bit of an RGB Maxi, which is this off chain token protocol on top of bitcoin. So we'll be also looking to add support for that in the future.
00:39:07.026 - 00:40:19.690, Speaker B: I mean, they need to release it first, but yeah, once that is done, you'll be able to swap between all the RGB coins on bitcoin to coins on Solana or on Ethereum. So yeah, that's certainly like something that we're looking to have. And then like, not sure if this will be like in twelve months, but we're also looking to enable this cross chain lending. So lending while using your bitcoin as a collateral and your bitcoin stays on bitcoin through this discrete lock contract because, yeah, we see a lot of value in that for. Yeah, I mean, for people who basically want to not want to pay taxes on their, on their bitcoin. Because if you were to sell your bitcoin, you need to pay the realized profit tax, but if you borrow against it, that's not considered a taxable event, so you can actually get dollars out also with a great advantage of not having to sell your bitcoin and still being exposed to bitcoin price rising, possibly.
00:40:19.842 - 00:40:24.454, Speaker C: This is not financial advice or tax advice.
00:40:26.354 - 00:40:40.090, Speaker A: Totally. Although I. Yeah, I'm definitely. Man, it's crazy how many bitcoins I talked to. And I'm like, so when are you going to realize the benefit of hodling for so long? And they're like, I'll. And they just pause. They're like, I'll sell it or I'll do whatever.
00:40:40.090 - 00:41:13.482, Speaker A: And I'm like, you probably want to lend against it if it's good collateral, but then you got to go to a custodian, which are like, oh, yeah, duh. I'm like, that's why you need defi. That's why I need people, like, trying to figure this stuff out so that we can do it in a less trusted fashion, less counterparty risk. So, yeah, hype for that RGB, hopefully soon. Everyone's been asking that for years, so we'll see when it launches. So altruist is interesting. You're going to liquid potentially first, I'm assuming, because it's Utxo based, so you can move faster there.
00:41:13.482 - 00:41:22.434, Speaker A: You've already built the infra. Any other l two s that are on your short list that you're looking at that aren't Utxo based?
00:41:23.174 - 00:41:55.718, Speaker B: I mean, we were also, like, looking kinda into rootstock, but just like, very high level, if that's something we could support as well. The thing is, rootstock already has some bridges that are. Yeah, because, like, it's EVM. So, like, bridges that have been on ethereum, they can, like, easily deploy there. So we'll have to see if there is, like, a lot of value in and us being there. But, yeah, that's certainly something that we will be looking into.
00:41:55.886 - 00:42:09.474, Speaker C: One more thing, we also have an SDK of atomic, which means we can also implement it into other protocols, for example. And we're in talks with the first ones already. So stay tuned where you might find us in the future.
00:42:10.014 - 00:42:10.654, Speaker A: Huge.
00:42:10.774 - 00:42:11.142, Speaker B: Huge.
00:42:11.198 - 00:42:38.244, Speaker A: No, I love it. That means you can integrate into an application or into a wallet. And you saw this. One of the big examples of people who haven't seen this is Aqua wallet leverages bolts in the wallet, and all you do is you're just swapping in and out. You don't feel the complexity of l one, l two, and other tokens, which I think is beautiful. I think that's the path that we have to go towards. And ideally, the piece in the middle is non custodial.
00:42:38.244 - 00:42:44.746, Speaker A: And as we go along, that will be more the case? I think so. That's fantastic.
00:42:44.850 - 00:42:46.694, Speaker C: Sounds like music to my ears.
00:42:47.754 - 00:43:34.504, Speaker B: One very interesting thing you can do with an SDK is make actually, every Solana wallet, a lightning wallet as well. So you can just make it automatically recognize a lightning invoice and then use atomic SDK in the background to do trustless swap between Solana and lightning. And the user doesn't even need to know about it. So you can actually pay with Solana and all the merchants that already accept lightning. It's actually, like, a funny thing. This is actually how we demoed the product when we first built it for Solana hackathon in a subway, which is the sandwich chain in Berlin, accepted lightning. And we just went there.
00:43:34.504 - 00:43:47.034, Speaker B: Sylvie went there and was able to pay with Solana. And, yeah, the merchant didn't know that he's being paid in Solana. He received lightning bitcoin in the end.
00:43:47.854 - 00:44:27.714, Speaker C: We also often used this use case, basically because it's one. If I tell people, oh, we're building a cross chain interoperability protocol and so on, everyone shuts off, and they're just like, wait, what? Cross. Wait, what? So if you usually, like, demo a payment and you can see on the screen that, okay, I paid in Seoul, and the other person is actually receiving bitcoin lightning. This is something very tangible. And it's also like, yeah, people understand exactly what we're doing there. But it also had a drawback. A lot of people thought we're only doing lightning, and a lot of people thought we're only doing payments, whereas the trading case is still a much bigger one at this point in time.
00:44:28.134 - 00:45:04.084, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting, because the way lightning is constructed, you have, like, you reveal this thing, there's, like, a secret, and then that's why there's kind of a pause when it comes to, like, say, doing subscriptions on lightning. Like, that hasn't been figured out yet because there's a pause in the execution layer. We have to, like, you as a user, have to do another action to complete something. And so it sounds like what you're saying is that potentially, with something like Solana or smart contract platform that's listening properly, they can act like that middleware piece that can watch and execute and then do the other half. Do I have that right?
00:45:05.464 - 00:46:10.044, Speaker B: Well, I mean, we will have to think more about that, but not sure if that would exactly work, just because, well, yeah, like you said, like, enlightening. You have this secret, so, which is like a pre image for a hash of the invoice, and, like, having a chain, like, Solana doesn't help that, because that secret needs to stay, well, secret. And if you have it on chain, like, smart contracts, they cannot hold secrets. Right? Like, that's just not possible. So, yeah, actually seems like subscriptions will still be something that's not solved. But, yeah, I've seen, like, some actually, like, last week I was in Italy for, like, lightning summit, and here was it, like, Albie had this web ln, right? And now they're working on this Nostra wallet connect. So it's like, a better way to connect your wallet to some website.
00:46:10.044 - 00:47:00.424, Speaker B: And they also have a way how to do subscriptions. So if you have a custodial wallet, that's easy. So you just authorize, like, okay, like, every month there can be, like, 20K sats sent to this party. And for non custodial wallets just works in a way that you always get a notification there and you can accept it for now. But I can see that also being solved in the future because you can also probably say to your non custodial wallet, okay, I authorize this amount of funds, funds per month to this recipient, and then the recipient basically tries to pull the funds and your wallet space. And, I mean, your phone is online most of the time anyway. So that's not a problem.
00:47:00.424 - 00:47:16.784, Speaker B: It just needs to be implemented. But, yeah, I see that this could actually work quite fine. I mean, there's a lot of talk of, like, oh, lightning. You have to be online to receive. I mean, like, come on, you're always online with your phone anyway. Like, that's not an issue.
00:47:18.204 - 00:47:27.620, Speaker A: Yep. Makes sense. Yeah. People will not leave the house without their phone. It's always, you know, you got Lte, you're good to go. Interesting. Okay.
00:47:27.620 - 00:47:35.264, Speaker A: I think that's all the questions I have. So, yeah. Any. Anything we didn't cover that you guys want to close on?
00:47:36.964 - 00:47:38.452, Speaker C: Good question. I think.
00:47:38.508 - 00:48:11.894, Speaker B: I mean, we could probably go for a lot longer, but. Yeah, yeah, I mean, we covered the most important things about tomic, about bitcoin, and, yeah, if you want to learn more, just head over to atomic exchange. We also have docs there. So if you really want to dive deep and see how it works in the background and to check for yourself that this is really secure, feel free to. And feel free to follow us on Twitter. We are at atomiclabs.
00:48:12.054 - 00:48:20.914, Speaker C: So just one thing. It's not atomic with a c in the end, but with a q because, yeah, you have a high iq if you're using us.
00:48:22.894 - 00:48:37.790, Speaker A: Love it. Love it. Awesome. Well, yeah, this has been an excellent combo. Love what you guys are building as usual, peeps. I'll have all the links down below, make it easy for you to click and check it out. But yeah, thanks for coming on and dropping on something, Adam.
00:48:37.790 - 00:48:38.806, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
