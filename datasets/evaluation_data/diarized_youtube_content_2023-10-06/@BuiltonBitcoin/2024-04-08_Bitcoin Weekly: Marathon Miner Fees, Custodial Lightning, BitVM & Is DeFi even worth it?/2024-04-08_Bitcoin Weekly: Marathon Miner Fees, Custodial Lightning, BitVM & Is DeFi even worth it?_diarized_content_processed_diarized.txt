00:00:00.240 - 00:00:19.234, Speaker A: What's up? What's up? What's up, everybody? Welcome back to not another bitcoin podcast or the show with no name. And half the crew is in NYC right now, you know, doing the ordinals nft thing. So we got some pinch hitters in to back them up first. Bob, how you doing, my man?
00:00:19.614 - 00:00:27.354, Speaker B: Yeah, doing good. Happy to be here. Always, always happy to sit back and chat about the latest happenings on bitcoin.
00:00:27.664 - 00:00:34.044, Speaker A: Absolutely. And there's. And there's a lot to talk about, as usual. Ian, how you doing, man?
00:00:34.464 - 00:00:35.176, Speaker C: Good, good.
00:00:35.280 - 00:00:39.488, Speaker D: I know you must be real desperate, Jake, but glad to. Glad to be here.
00:00:39.536 - 00:00:45.564, Speaker A: Glad to be here nonetheless. You're saying the quiet things out loud. Ian, Phillip, how you doing, man?
00:00:46.064 - 00:00:55.848, Speaker C: Doing great. Very, very happy to be here and to be the rookie of the show. So I'm honored now.
00:00:55.976 - 00:01:20.564, Speaker A: Happy to have you guys. This will be a fun conversation. I think so, yeah. This is wide ranging, so we can go wherever we want. I think one interesting topic might be the. I posted a screenshot a couple days ago about marathon. So there's like a chart of the last thousand blocks, and then it takes the average of the block fee, so like 1000, whatever the average block was.
00:01:20.564 - 00:02:04.014, Speaker A: And then it shows the different pools and how they're doing compared to that average. And everyone besides marathon was in the red, so they're pushing up the average. Which begs the question, like, why is that happening? It could be a fat finger, which would throw off the numbers, but I tend to think it's probably some of the new innovations they're putting out, like slipstream, which is a way to send non standard transactions directly to a miner. And it's paid inbound, so the fee is on chain, but it's not. It doesn't hit the mempool. And you're seeing this with, like, what ordinals bot is doing with some of these big inscriptions, the runestone inscriptions. Those are mostly going through marathon, and they're charging a premium for that.
00:02:04.014 - 00:02:23.232, Speaker A: So that, that's interesting. And there's a bunch of questions that open up around that of like, does this the miner centralization, or are the miners gonna follow? So I'll use that to level set. We can open the discussion there. What do you guys think when you see that chart?
00:02:23.408 - 00:02:33.968, Speaker B: Probably wants to go first, or does this result in a relaxing of the standardness rules? Which is also an interesting option.
00:02:34.136 - 00:02:57.690, Speaker A: Right? Which could be like, do what we quickly see. Because actually, as I posted that, I was like, how many pools have transaction accelerators? All of them all of foundries on endpool space. Ant pool has a big one. Everyone has transaction accelerators, but they're all for standard transactions. They just basically bump the fee up. They don't get you out of the standard. Marathon is the first to do that, so.
00:02:57.690 - 00:03:06.534, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Does that push to that becoming more norm and core becomes less relevant in some sense?
00:03:07.894 - 00:03:22.314, Speaker C: So as an, as an ordinal snoop somewhat, I would ask myself, like, what is a non standard transaction? Does it mean the whole block is filled with ordinals of the same, like series? Or what does it generally mean? Yeah.
00:03:24.614 - 00:03:38.388, Speaker A: The two things I'm aware of is that a transaction can't be over 400 kb, which is one, and opera turn can't be over 80 bytes. And those are the main two levers that are currently being played with.
00:03:38.516 - 00:04:20.524, Speaker B: I would say a third one is the dust limit. You have Utxo has to be over 330 bytes, I believe. I think Unisat uses 546, but I think for TaPr you can go as low as 330 doing a non standard transaction. You could batch mint like 1000 ordinals, and you can use a one sat output. You won't be able to transfer that using the standard mempool, because it's not a standard transaction, it's under the dust limit. But it does let you do these kinds of mass airdrops, which is really appealing to creators that are looking to reward their collectors. And so that's the third one.
00:04:22.264 - 00:05:16.004, Speaker D: I was just pretty stunned at the sheer delta between. I imagine we could probably do some back of the envelope math of knowing what share they have of blocks, knowing roughly how many transactions are packaged into each. I bet we could probably come up with a rough estimate. I wish I would have thought of that, but it suggests to me, to your point, Jake, the hypothesis around fat fingering the gap suggests that this is a very real thing, probably slipstream, and it suggests that that volume is probably fairly significant, just given the, the difference between their fee rates and others. So it'd be interesting to do that math. So there's definitely, there's clearly demand for that product somewhere. Pretty interesting.
00:05:17.984 - 00:05:48.444, Speaker C: Right? So, one other thing that I was thinking, because 12%, it is actually a lot over a thousand blocks. And so that is significant. But the other thing, and I don't know the background behind this, and maybe you guys can explain this too, but I saw a tweet passing by marathon where they drew their logo, the m in the mempool. I don't know how much such a thing costs, but that's like, first pretty badass, and maybe it's a showcase of their slipstream product or how do you guys see that?
00:05:49.104 - 00:06:30.800, Speaker B: I think they only had to give up, like, 20k in fees or something like that because block fees were. Block fees were already so low, and then they were essentially able to, you know, color, color each block however they wanted. I really, really loved the marathon m. It's just like the. The right mix of rebellious plus creative plus insightful plus, like, you know, almost like a statement about the future of bitcoin in a way. So I thought it was brilliant, super, super fun. I don't know what the ramifications are.
00:06:30.800 - 00:07:11.904, Speaker B: I mean, if we start getting really, really creative, carefully crafted blocks and we start getting out of band payments, I mean, there are a lot of incentives issues with this, perhaps where now we don't have correct fee market in the mempool. And marathon even said to not base. There's a. I can't remember what it's called, but a specific setting you use with your pool to calibrate on, like, difficulty or pricing or something like that. And marathon said, don't use our. Don't use our blocks in your calculation, like, exclude our blocks because we're doing all of these out of band payments.
00:07:13.204 - 00:07:22.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, to be clear, they're doing inbound but not in the mempool. Right. That's the correct way to phrase it. Because the slipstream is in bandwidth, it just doesn't hit the mempool.
00:07:24.594 - 00:07:25.734, Speaker B: In band.
00:07:26.354 - 00:07:35.214, Speaker A: The fees. The fees show up not as a payment outside of the network. They show up in the transaction, but they're not calculated in the mempool.
00:07:36.914 - 00:07:37.794, Speaker B: I understand.
00:07:37.954 - 00:07:52.006, Speaker A: Now, you never fully know if they're being true there. Maybe they're just paying a premium and they're getting an extra vig on top. Like, there's always an honest assumption of them what the Maya is doing, but it isn't. It is. You are seeing transaction fees on chain, but it's.
00:07:52.190 - 00:08:01.510, Speaker B: It's almost the same as an out of band payment in that you don't get a correct PvP warfare in the mempool.
00:08:01.702 - 00:08:07.014, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So you pay a premium compared to the current. Go ahead, Ian.
00:08:07.054 - 00:08:12.566, Speaker D: This was bad for visibility. I mean, that, you know, you start to get to, like, reliability of the settlement network.
00:08:12.630 - 00:08:12.878, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:12.926 - 00:09:05.641, Speaker D: You know, I mean, it's. It's. It's not just sort of an inconvenience to users. You know, you start to really impact payment timing estimates, and it's like, who knows where this goes? I don't know how to model that out. I don't know that there is a good heuristic to use to even say like, oh, well, this is what we could see in terms of what we might call the true sort of fee composition and how far that might move, because clearly there's an incentive. And going back, Bob, to your point around, like, do we relax the definition of standard nonstandard? I suspect we see either that or the introduction of slipstream competitors. And so therefore, how far does that marker move?
00:09:05.817 - 00:09:06.774, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:09:07.634 - 00:09:12.054, Speaker B: And once everyone has a slipstream product, nobody does.
00:09:12.994 - 00:09:13.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:14.954 - 00:09:15.354, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:15.394 - 00:09:33.574, Speaker B: Then you basically just turn off the standardness rules, and then everyone just goes back to normal, normal mining blocks. That's probably not going to happen. I mean, the standardist rules are in there with specific purposes to prevent ddosing or other potential attacks on the network. So I don't know.
00:09:33.984 - 00:09:35.004, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:09:36.144 - 00:09:38.472, Speaker A: Yeah. Philip, you got your thoughts?
00:09:38.608 - 00:10:25.028, Speaker C: Yeah, so I have one more thing. I was just looking at the data, and I think this really warrants a bit more math, and maybe you guys can help me, because in the last thousand blocks, there was 26 that marathon mined. And so first I was thinking thousand blocks, that's a lot. But then I saw they only had 26 of those. And so if they had 12% more in average revenue, how significant is it really? Then maybe they just had one block, as you say, jake, where someone fat fingers. Or maybe they had an extraordinary standard block that was just really good. Because on 26, if one or two of those 26 are extraordinarily good, that pushes up their average revenue by quite a bit.
00:10:25.028 - 00:10:36.932, Speaker C: Right. You just need one of those 26 to be really good, I assume, because it's average. So it's relative. It's not absolute. Or am I thinking wrong about this? No, I'm not sure.
00:10:36.988 - 00:11:09.128, Speaker A: But no, I think that's right. I posted that chart. And what I don't have is how often is luck a factor in these kind of thousand block periods where either a fat finger or a fee spike, like a BRCA tournament, it just happens to go to one miner because they get a lucky streak. I don't know. Which is kind of like, there's a lot of questions around mining that. It's not very. I wouldn't say it's not transparent, but the data is just not good enough yet.
00:11:09.128 - 00:12:01.186, Speaker A: Especially like, mining across different pools. We have kind of like average hash rate, which you'll expect to get, but you don't. We don't have data on, like, I pointed 100 XYZ hash to this pool and this pool and this pool. And I got paid at the end of the day, this much, like, factoring in fees and all that, which, I mean, it's a broad topic for, like, a different conversation, but, like, there's different payout methods. And the current dominant one is called fpps, full pay per share, and it averages fees. So, like, if marathon continues this, and slipstream is a factor, they're by definition making other pools poorer because it's averaged out. Like, they take an average of the past day, and they say, here's what the average block produced, and we'll pay out miners a safe amount.
00:12:01.186 - 00:12:13.014, Speaker A: And if there's peaks and valleys, the pool operator takes on that risk. But if one pool is being overly profitable, everyone's getting poorer. I think is how that math works out.
00:12:14.324 - 00:12:36.264, Speaker C: Yeah, that kind of makes sense in my head. Additionally, I was thinking, how hard is it to build something like slipstream? Because you mentioned, Bob, if everyone has it, no one has it on a relative basis. Is this rocket science? Does it take months to years to develop? Or how do you see this competitor sketching up?
00:12:40.424 - 00:13:19.934, Speaker B: I have no idea how hard to build a product like slipstream. I mean, it feels just like a transaction accelerator, essentially, except that you're including non standard transactions. And so maybe there's some kind of service where you can actually craft nonstandard transactions. I mean, there's a little bit of work there to actually just make non standard transactions and submit them. And so maybe they have some tooling there on the scripting, bitcoin scripting side to kind of make that happen. Especially with, we've seen a number of really large ordinals get inscribed over the last couple of weeks, 3.96 megabytes.
00:13:19.934 - 00:13:45.224, Speaker B: And so in that case, you're taking up an entire block, which shouldn't be too crazy. You just inscribe a really big image in a single transaction, and then you just submit the transaction. So it's actually not crazy on the technical side there. 400 kilobyte limit. Yeah, that one's not bad. Opera turn. That one's not bad either.
00:13:45.224 - 00:14:07.382, Speaker B: It might not actually be that hard. I mean, it just feels like you're crafting normal bitcoin transactions, except they don't fall into the standardist rules. And then you just submit those into a block, give them priority in your private mempool, and then you're good to go. Maybe on. Maybe I'm dramatically oversimplifying here, but I don't know.
00:14:07.558 - 00:14:12.154, Speaker C: But it's not something like you could break consensus or something bad.
00:14:13.614 - 00:14:16.846, Speaker B: No, I mean, they all fit, they all fit within bitcoin consensus.
00:14:16.950 - 00:14:35.126, Speaker A: So yeah, off to get, I think Portland Hodl is the mastermind behind a lot of this and so I gotta get him on too because he's been contracted by Mara to do a lot of this work. So pick his brain. Okay. Yeah, we'll get topics, but yeah, go ahead.
00:14:35.150 - 00:15:10.550, Speaker B: Yeah. One, one really interesting thing I was going to say is using the slipstream product and using this one sat output, you can batch mint BRC twenties in a way that you can't do with runes. For example. There's a one. So if Philippine Ian, if you haven't been following along, Casey Rottermore is releasing a new fungible token standard called runes. Coming into having runes is a fully Utxo based protocol. BRC 20 is like, I don't know, 80% account based, 20% Utxo based because that's how the standard works.
00:15:10.550 - 00:15:47.244, Speaker B: You can batch mint BRC twenties, you cannot batch mint runes. Runes are specifically one minting per transaction or one runes deploy per transaction. BRC 20 is you could have, I don't know, a million outputs, you know, one sat outputs in a transaction maybe. Anyway, so it's interesting to think through the mechanics there on slipstream. Plus these BRC 20 batch fungible token minting, it's almost the perfect match for the crazy, crazy djins.
00:15:48.284 - 00:15:52.548, Speaker A: Isn't that what, did ordinals bot do that with their trio BrSq 20?
00:15:52.676 - 00:15:58.188, Speaker B: Do you know, I think they did, yes, something like that.
00:15:58.276 - 00:15:58.900, Speaker C: Yep.
00:15:59.052 - 00:16:41.844, Speaker A: And then, and so the way the one set, the reason you have a dust limit and you can help me, but like if you set it too low, it's uneconomical just to use that Utxo as an input. But when you have something like BRC 20, the way the wallets are constructed currently, you have a separate batch of inscriptions and they're held apart in a taproot specific wallet. And then you spend from a kind of fungible batch is how they typically do it. And so a one sat output that's a bunch of basic twice technically could still work fine from that perspective because you're just doing a bunch of inputs that will then they're not getting destroyed in that same way. And you just spend from the fungible balance.
00:16:42.784 - 00:17:12.726, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not great for the Utxo set. Like, definitely is bloating the Utxo set. Now you have hundreds of thousands of one sat Utxos, but from like a degen perspective, being able to, you know, just do a sat per output. And those mint inscriptions, you don't actually have to do anything with them. They're just a byproduct of the transaction. The mint inscription is useless at that point, and the balance is credited directly to your address. And so you don't even have to do anything with them.
00:17:12.726 - 00:17:23.994, Speaker B: They just. I mean, it's wasteful and, like, not ideal and not elegant and not bite conscious and, you know, like, could potentially cause problems, but, you know, you can do it.
00:17:24.694 - 00:17:35.598, Speaker A: Yep. Okay, makes sense. Okay, topic switch. Left turn. I want to talk about lightning. Coinbase, lightspark. This was a big announcement over the past week.
00:17:35.598 - 00:18:04.092, Speaker A: Most of the exchanges now support lightning. Coinbase has been the one big holdout. It's still not live, but Lightspark announced that they're having partnership with Coinbase. Lightspark is the kind of, like, institutional infrastructure lightning service provider by the guy who is doing Facebook's crypto thing, David Marcus, the co founder, the creator of Lightning Network works there. Tag. This seems bigger. I'm still super bullish on lightning.
00:18:04.092 - 00:18:11.264, Speaker A: I like to see the biggest exchanges activate. Lightning. Yeah, I don't know. What's your thoughts? Let me start with you, Ian.
00:18:12.084 - 00:18:20.156, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely interesting. I think Lightning's had a very interesting sort of arc across its history.
00:18:20.300 - 00:18:21.824, Speaker C: You had a long time.
00:18:22.284 - 00:18:23.972, Speaker D: Okay, where is it? Where is it?
00:18:23.988 - 00:18:24.500, Speaker C: Where is it?
00:18:24.532 - 00:19:25.188, Speaker D: Now we're starting to finally see adoption from exchanges. I think obviously, it will save costs for transfers. I think it also somewhat depends on different user segments. For those user segments that are going on a coinbase that are stacking sats and then just withdrawing that to cold storage, I don't think lightning necessarily plays a huge role there by definition. But as we start to see more and more ways to actually use bitcoin, and there's this whole plethora of l two s and different sort of protocols that are working to be interoperable with lightning, as you can do more and more things with bitcoin, I think that's the point at which it starts to get really interesting that these exchanges have integrated it. The other just interesting thing, because I was looking a little bit into that Lightspark is, I think, also behind. What is it, the universal money address standard.
00:19:25.188 - 00:20:14.054, Speaker D: This is an open source protocol. I think it came out, like, November 2023. And it's the combination of lightning addresses, which are like, human readable ways to do lightning payments, combined with fiat on and off ramps and whatnot. And it's pretty interesting that Lightspark. So, Lightspark. And then you look at some of the entities that are, like, founding members or I forget what they call them. But you have entities like zero hash, for example, which at least in the US, is the thing that's probably behind, like, all the products that have some sort of an on off ramp that includes things like Moonpay, that includes things like stripes, crypto, stuff like, it's all zero hash.
00:20:14.054 - 00:20:56.492, Speaker D: So I say all of that to say that, like, I don't know that we will see an explosion in lightning network usage simply because Coinbase is implementing it yet. But I share your bullishness, Jake. I do think the pieces are coming together, and for folks that are interested, maybe to kind of think a little more high level about the lightning network. Roy Sheinfeld from Breeze writes a lot of really, really good stuff. He wrote a piece quite recently that sort of analogizes lightning as like. Like on chain is sort of trains moving big, kind of heavy cargo. Lightning is now like the highways.
00:20:56.492 - 00:21:57.106, Speaker D: And then now there's a lot of innovation happening to try and solve for that last mile delivery. And I personally think, as someone who, I'm a co founder of a company that is fundamentally lightning first, I think we learned a lot over the last year about lightning in the context of on payer, on chain fees. And it became less obvious that lightning is the sort of, like, absolute ultimate end customer, end consumer solution. And so you've seen interesting things like e cash, you've seen interesting, like some of these different federation models, you've seen proposals like Ark. So it's not clear where that dust is going to settle. But I think between the light sparks of the world, between some of what Roy is writing about and these LSP's, you're starting to see the topography of the network coming together, and it'll be really interesting to see. But I would say, in my vantage point, super bullish on lightning.
00:21:57.106 - 00:22:08.734, Speaker D: I don't know that I'm super bullish on lightning being the ultimate self custodial end user cache day to day payment tool, if that makes sense.
00:22:11.414 - 00:22:12.126, Speaker A: Yep.
00:22:12.270 - 00:22:13.234, Speaker D: Anybody else?
00:22:14.134 - 00:22:17.958, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I can chime in after anything else.
00:22:18.006 - 00:22:18.634, Speaker C: Ian.
00:22:19.654 - 00:22:20.166, Speaker A: That's it.
00:22:20.190 - 00:22:21.334, Speaker D: I'm off my soapbox.
00:22:21.494 - 00:23:13.144, Speaker B: Okay. I was gonna say, I wonder if we get lightning and Coinbase, then how long until someone builds a way to take runes to lightning? And then how long until we get a runes token that is integrated at Coinbase, leveraging the lightning side rather than the bitcoin integration side, because it might just be super easy to add token support if you can leverage the existing lightning integration rather than having to build out full bitcoin rune support, you just support tokens on the Lightning network. I wonder if there's a path there where in the next, I don't know, year, two years we get a token other than lightning, bitcoin that is on lightning that gets added to an exchange. I wonder if we see that.
00:23:14.924 - 00:23:15.668, Speaker C: We will.
00:23:15.796 - 00:23:58.284, Speaker D: And I don't know that it will be runes. I think runes will get there for sure. You probably know where I'm going with this, Bob, but I think Taproot assets will probably be like the first across the line there. And that's interesting because anything running led and tap d is just going to be able to inherit that right away. I'm pretty sure that's what Whitespark uses, so that'll potentially be an interesting kind of proof case or example. Do we see a major stable coin like tether on lightning as a taproot asset? How does that then inform what we see on runes? It'll be super interesting to see the different kind of user segments that form around those two different things.
00:24:01.534 - 00:24:56.510, Speaker C: Philip thought, yeah, I want to chime in a bit too, because I have a very different view on lightning and somewhat bearish, I guess. First I need to say that it's always dangerous to dismiss technology like, say this has failed or this doesn't work. You certainly see that a lot right? These days on Twitter RNX, I should say, namely lightning has failed, let's forget it, failed experiment because of a variety of problems. And so that's why I was very surprised because I subscribed to that few, because, like, I got really deep into bitcoin in 2018, 2019, and then I think it was 2020, I started setting up lightning channels with some of my friends, and I was like, what are we going to do now? That was kind of like the end of it. No one uses it. I'm done. The lightning on your own notes, you know, the lightning channel is just sitting, sitting there.
00:24:56.510 - 00:25:53.718, Speaker C: And so I was very confused. And I always try to do that kind of from a user ux point of view, what is lightning supposed to be used for? And Ian, I know you're running a lightning company, so that could be a very interesting use case. And so my question would be, how many exchanges that do support lightning today see a usage increase in lightning specifically because it goes two ways, right? One, I don't know if it's a chicken and egg problem, but one is certainly you need exchange support for people to use it, but our exchange is really going to put engineering time and money in it. And maintain the infrastructure if they don't see sustained demand for it. And I just don't know anyone using lightning today. My two cent. I mean, I live somewhere in Europe and not many of my friends hold crypto to begin with, but they all hold some bitcoin either on a centralized exchange or non custodial.
00:25:53.718 - 00:26:13.726, Speaker C: And none of them really know they have heard of lightning, but they don't know what to do with it. So I think that's a fundamental problem. You have lightning deposits. Okay, cool. Yeah. I can save you some money, but if I don't have BTC on lightning on the lightning shell, does that work? I don't even know. And so I don't know really what.
00:26:13.726 - 00:27:13.428, Speaker C: Yeah, honestly what the use cases are and so about runes and about everything going on to lightning. I think the probability in my head that runes takes off is significant, but isn't, which is maybe another topic. I'll stick with runes specifically. First, on lightning, what is the probability that it goes onto lightning versus on another layer too? What's the friction there? How do we get it onto lightning channels? Do we need to manage all that? Like, inbound and outbound channel capacity are out? As I work, I just have like a ton of questions around there and it feels like all these things need to be really abstracted away for the average show to start using it. Because I built smart contracts as a job, right. And I could look into lightning and I'm sure I would somehow understand it, but I don't think the average user today still really understands what lightning actually does and how to use it. But that's from my almost uneducated few, I would say.
00:27:13.428 - 00:27:20.744, Speaker C: And maybe that's good that I'm sitting here because maybe I can get bullish after our chat. I don't know.
00:27:22.364 - 00:27:58.592, Speaker D: I do think that. I mean, I do think this idea of, like, it goes back to kind of what I was saying of. I do think the community as a whole has sort of, you know, like. I don't want to say the ball posts have moved, but I do think our collective understanding of, like, what lightning is and where it can be best used. Like, I do think that has evolved over time. And that's what I was saying earlier, of my ability to kind of like, use lightning non custodially, to like, pay for a cup of coffee. We're still a long way from that and I don't.
00:27:58.592 - 00:28:02.728, Speaker D: I personally don't know if that is even where we will get to.
00:28:02.816 - 00:28:03.600, Speaker C: And that is.
00:28:03.632 - 00:28:47.584, Speaker D: I'm saying this as someone very bullish on lightning. That doesn't mean that lightning, you know, doesn't have its uses. There's some interesting research linked in this article from Roy. I can link it to you, Jake, if you want to, like, attach it to the thing river, which is a bitcoin exchange, and they have lightning all integrated. I think they had done some analysis last year to look at how had lightning increased bitcoins throughput. And according to their calculations, there's an increase of 42%, basically nearly 50% more payment capacity, with a tiny fraction of the on chain transactions. So, like, there's something there.
00:28:47.584 - 00:29:34.104, Speaker D: However, in my view, again, like the exchange to consumer use case, I don't see that as being, like, super burning. And I would suspect, Philip, to your point, like the exchanges that have introduced lighting, I would be surprised if they saw a huge adoption of it. I think lightning is a lot more interesting for things like remittances, cross border payments. I spent some time in Costa Rica, and I'm not saying this is the huge scale in numbers, but you have all these little circular economies popping up, and I was spending sats at local farmers market buying things. It does and can work, but.
00:29:35.804 - 00:29:36.092, Speaker B: I.
00:29:36.108 - 00:30:01.664, Speaker D: Think we have sort of, like, to use lightning. Not considerably. It's still difficult because it is fundamentally a liquidity network. In order to accept a payment, you need what is called inbound liquidity or inbound capacity. And the only way to get that is if you have someone else open a channel with you. And so a couple years ago, this was like a. It was a completely blocking ux problem.
00:30:01.664 - 00:30:51.134, Speaker D: You now have lsps or lightning service providers that have largely solved for that. So you've got breeze, you've got Phoenix, you've got some of these wallets now that I actually, I don't think are, like, yet ready for the average Joe, to your point, Philip. But I do think they're a huge improvement versus what you were doing in 2018 or whatnot. And so it'll be interesting to see. But I do think we've. I'm quite interested in things like fetimint, and I know people sometimes cringe at the notion of, like, federations and whatnot, but I think it's at least an instructive example of what this sort of, like, e cache piece on top might look like on top of lightning and interoperable with lightning. But the story is very much yet to be written.
00:30:53.814 - 00:30:57.034, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:30:57.654 - 00:31:33.264, Speaker C: No, I was just gonna say it's always tough for these kind of technologies to take off, because if I follow your reasoning, and I would agree with it. I used a wallet of Satoshi, for instance, for a while, which I believe is a custodial lightning wallet. And then the question is if I want to go to those, I don't know, mom and pop shops or circular economies, like, yeah, they need to accept that, too. And so again, it's. I feel like there's a lot of friction. I'm just wondering what the use case will be. You know, that people start saying, yes, let's go.
00:31:33.264 - 00:32:26.114, Speaker C: I still haven't been to El Salvador, for instance, but I've been hearing, anecdotally, a lot of people saying, yeah, none of those citizens on the small local markets want to even accept bitcoin, whether that's lightning or don't even talk to them, you know, about lightning, they just want dollars. And so again, the question is, I'm not speaking for or against dollars or for, against bitcoin or lightning. It's more like, how can we improve people's lives not adding friction? And what's the killer use case? Because they don't care. You know, they don't care that something is called lightning. We're four nerds sitting here getting excited about lightning. But what is really the value add for those people using lightning? You know, and that's. It's really tough with any technology, you know, including all bitcoin L2s, and I think stacks and all those things that I'm working on full time.
00:32:26.114 - 00:32:34.174, Speaker C: And I think we really need to be, yeah. Aware and skeptical of that. But yeah, just my two cent and I don't know the others.
00:32:35.234 - 00:32:59.746, Speaker A: No, I mean, some of the things I'm aware of. So I have read that Lightning report from river. One of the interesting stats from that report is that half of the transactions on the network are $0.30 or less, which is like, super interesting because visa typically use PayPal. They're going to charge you $0.35 base plus a percentage. So now you're already in a bucket of like, uneconomical for credit cards.
00:32:59.746 - 00:33:36.166, Speaker A: And when you look at most of lightning usage, it's not the QR code scanning or sending to a lightning address. It's stacker news zaps, it's noster zaps, it's fountain FM streaming sets. And so there's this use case or this ux of you have a basket of custodial sets, and then you dole them out in baby amounts for micro frictionless behaviors. And zapping is the most common one, but you don't see that on the timeline. Because you don't. It's not really like a distinct use case. You just click a button.
00:33:36.166 - 00:34:07.414, Speaker A: It feels like you're liking something, but you're sending, you know, two pennies to someone for that, you know, picture of a frog or whatever it is. So I think that's a pretty big use case. And again, it's not in the common, like, narrative, but that could be fucking huge, especially if it's custodial. And if it's custodial in private, like, the company doesn't want to put it on the network, but you're kind of like sharing with the ledger. You're still trading in saTs. You can withdraw when you want. You could do massive volume and you would never see it.
00:34:08.634 - 00:34:52.022, Speaker D: You know, I don't want to show jolts, but it's relevant, right? My company jolts rewards. Like, we're building the ability to basically reward people with SATs over lightning for like, all of those use cases, Jake, that you're saying. It could be, it could be like silly little things like signing up for a newsletter. It could be, you know, I refer someone to your business, you know, I make a purchase. Obviously those are more classic kind of use cases, but it could be like I got a new role permission in a discord server. It could be I'm an internal salesperson who just closed a deal as one in Salesforce. All of these as these, like, digital triggers, you know.
00:34:52.022 - 00:35:01.898, Speaker D: To your point, Jake, in terms of like, micro payments, micro rewards, I do think there's something interesting there. Um, but, but yeah, that is, that.
00:35:01.906 - 00:35:22.050, Speaker C: Is actually really cool. Micropayments, I think could be a really big use case. And I have another cool example. And, um, this, this is actually on Solana, but I have this email address. Um, it's philipolink.com. And Sol link.com is an email service that blocks emails until the user pays for it.
00:35:22.050 - 00:35:49.192, Speaker C: So emails only arrive in my inbox and they can pay either $5 or $1. And if they pay $1, I will reply within seven days or I cannot, you know, claim the $1. If it's $5, it's like a high priority email. I will reply within, I don't know, a day or something. I forgot what I said. Only two people emailed me since I got it. But the point is, it's a cool use case for microbins.
00:35:49.192 - 00:36:11.540, Speaker C: I think this would be awesome, say on lightning. In this case, it's on USDC, on Solana, but it might as well be lightning on bitcoin. I definitely see that, and it's all about the people that end up building it and take away the friction from the user. And that's an awesome use case because I'm using that day to day. And again, whether it's USDC or SATs, I'd gladly accept Sats if that product exists.
00:36:11.612 - 00:36:11.892, Speaker A: So.
00:36:11.948 - 00:36:13.104, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely.
00:36:14.364 - 00:36:51.320, Speaker A: Yep, yep. Okay. I want to maybe put two more topics on the docket. One's kind of like philosophically defi, and then one maybe if you've read it, Bob, the wizards put out some bitvm heresy this morning about how BitVM bridges are not as dope as we think they are. Actually, one more quick topic on lightning, because this has been new in my head, and I can't tell if I'm crazy or not, but I actually think custodial lightning is, like, a great first use case. I think we should lean way more into it. And the reason I say that is because visa and all these credit card networks are, like, closed by nature and they're all custodial.
00:36:51.320 - 00:37:41.104, Speaker A: They control the whole stack. And you can go into cash, and cash is private, but once you get above trying to get ten k from your bank, then you'd be like, what are you buying, bro? What's going on over here? But with custodial lightning, if you lean into that and make the UX great and get people to use it, you have two parallel systems that you're optimizing for UX and market adoption. But it's not that hard to come behind it with non custodial. And it's way easier to switch from custodial to non custodial than it is in fiat world with credit cards and cash. So I think we should be leaning way more into custodial and just getting users because no one's really been, like, rugged from custodial services in a big number yet. We haven't seen the government come down. We've seen Wallace Satoshi, like, proactively not going to the US, but they weren't told to do anything.
00:37:41.524 - 00:37:42.692, Speaker D: So I think custodial is the way.
00:37:42.708 - 00:37:58.304, Speaker A: To go for the next year or so and focus on getting users and then let other people make a one click function and go to an custodial thing. But I don't know, as a bitcoiner, that's going against the ethos. So I'm curious if your guys take on that.
00:37:59.524 - 00:38:21.548, Speaker D: I hate to say that I somewhat agree. Right. You know, I'm out here with a YouTube channel making, like, the hardcore self custody tutorial videos. I think you're right, Jake. Like, custodial lighting is such. It is a magical, like, experience, like, period, full stop. You know, Philip, you said Wallace, Satoshi, like, Wallace to just a really clean experience.
00:38:21.548 - 00:38:38.006, Speaker D: It's super easy. You know, when I was saying the Costa Rica example, they have the bitcoin jungle app down there, which is a custodial lightning wallet that all the merchants use and people use, and it's custodial, and it works incredibly, to your point, Jake?
00:38:38.110 - 00:38:38.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:38.350 - 00:39:07.880, Speaker D: I would want there to be an established path for people to make that transition. People are free to do what they want. They're free to trust whomever they want. And I think as long as you give them the option to make that transition and make it clear that, hey, this transition is something you should consider. I think that would be pretty interesting to have all that encompassed in one app. There definitely are still regulatory uncertainties. Money transmitter, blah, blah.
00:39:07.880 - 00:39:16.164, Speaker D: That I think Wallace Satoshi was sort of trying to get ahead of, not where that goes, but today, my idea.
00:39:19.104 - 00:39:21.164, Speaker A: Thoughts? Bob? Philip should move on.
00:39:22.224 - 00:39:47.060, Speaker C: Completely agree. I think. Look, I like decentralization, but first things first. I think people need to learn how to use those tools, and we need to avoid as much friction. And I feel like decentralization is a bit further along an adoption or learning curve, almost. But again, your opinion might be different. But I just agree.
00:39:47.060 - 00:40:10.364, Speaker C: I think it doesn't probably matter that much if. If they use wallet of satoshi, and then they find out, hey, this is actually custodial, and, hey, I am interested in hard money, etcetera, and then go down that rabbit hole. Whatever. I think adoption first and then education is, like, almost in parallel to that. Adoption. If they're smart people, they'll figure it out.
00:40:12.104 - 00:40:14.764, Speaker A: Yep. Bob, thoughts? Or should we move on?
00:40:15.864 - 00:40:21.594, Speaker B: We can move on. There's lots to discuss on those other topics you mentioned.
00:40:22.174 - 00:40:51.574, Speaker A: Cool. Then, yeah. We got, like, another ten or so minutes, I think so. One that I've been getting pushback on, on my timeline is even pursuing Defi as a goal is stupid, is one. And to me, that sounds like I get it. The Maxis are like, you self custody. You hold that shit like Fort Knox, and then when you need to, and it goes up enough, you know, you can go to some custodian and take a loan against it, or you could sell it and you just go and, like, buy a lambo, whatever.
00:40:51.574 - 00:41:34.110, Speaker A: But that sounds crazy to me. Like, if that's the goal, that sounds ludicrous. So, Defi, although it's super messy and there's hacks and a lot of unclear trust assumptions. Wading through that muck to build it seems like a very worthwhile goal. You know, we're in the model t days still of like Defi, so I'm always kind of caught off guard and people say that. So yeah, I'm just curious of like your guys's thoughts on this topic of like, is Defi and l two s and smart, like is this even a good use case that you should pursue it? It's gonna happen anyways. But yeah, broad topic, yeah, I talked.
00:41:34.142 - 00:42:52.104, Speaker B: With Aaron, as Aaron from the ordinals team for like an hour at ETH Denver, and it was specifically about bitcoin as this economic solution in the world. And then we talked about other chains, other tokens. I mean, Defi essentially just means decentralized finance. You have tokens, the tokenization of everything. And from a bitcoin perspective, like why? Why do you need other things? Why do you need tokens? Why do you need decentralization? There's almost like a chasm between these two camps of sorts. And from my perspective, I would say I'm more of a world computer. Maxi, if you could say that I want there to exist some decentralized computer that is permissionless and accessible and affordable and available for everyone and gives you compute, hosting and storage, just like TCP IP and other Internet protocols, but just gives you basically Amazon web services, but decentralized web services.
00:42:52.104 - 00:44:11.232, Speaker B: And this is something that doesn't really resonate a lot with a lot of people in bitcoin because they're like, why? Why would we need that? We're just here to solve, you know, the inflationary concerns with fiat currencies. But if you do think about it from a web development perspective, from a software perspective, from an Internet, like an open permissionless Internet, like what we all wanted the Internet to be thinking about how the Internet is controlled 50% by the big tech companies, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, et cetera. If you do want a better world for that open Internet, then I think this is a long circle getting there, but I think it all comes back to, do you want this open, decentralized applications on the Internet? If so, then tokens are actually extremely helpful in making that vision of the future reality. Tokens streamline incentives. They provide bootstrapping possibilities. They align incentives between users and developers and investors. There are lots of interesting use cases for tokens in that world.
00:44:11.232 - 00:44:28.674, Speaker B: But if you don't believe in that world, then DeFi is pointless. Why would you need Defi if you don't care about that version of the feature, that's how I view that specific critique. I know that's like huge, big picture, whatever, but, yeah.
00:44:32.454 - 00:44:58.542, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, these are all really good points, and I think it boils down to about the token specifically. I fully agree that's something you need to get over kind of thing, but. So I've been building for three years or something like that. Full diamond Defi. I've been part of a hack about $1.5 million. Once got stolen, we recovered a lot of that.
00:44:58.542 - 00:45:33.494, Speaker C: Also. We filled up the hole for users. And I think as a builder, man, it's so fucking painful to build DeFi. And I think Defi is a really bad term because a lot of what Defi is is not decentralized. I would say the majority is not decentralized. And I'm not even sure that it matters that it is decentralized. I mean, if it's not decentralized, there is trust, right? But for me, it's more, is it verifiable and is it permissionless? And that's the important part of that finance.
00:45:33.494 - 00:46:05.390, Speaker C: So I want to verifiably and permissionlessly be able to borrow against some of my assets that I have. And I cannot do that in traditional finance today, but I can do that on chain, whether that's on bitcoin layer one with ordinals or on a L2 or whatever. And for me, that is the definition of defi. And I think that's super important that it exists, but I think it is less important that it's completely. What is decentralization even. I think it's so stupid. Decentralization, it's a spectrum.
00:46:05.390 - 00:46:42.900, Speaker C: I think, first of all, it's not zero or one, and it's super hard to define. And for all four of us, decentralization will be something different. And so we will never find common ground to whether something is defi or not. I believe, because the defi term is just bad. And that goes to tokens, like Bob said, but it also goes to like, a smart contract can get hacked. And I'm super wary since I've been a builder of where I put my tokens, because I know of all the shit I can go wrong, and I'm like, I'm not putting my fucking tokens in here. And so that's when I do understand the bitcoin, like, the more die hard ones.
00:46:42.900 - 00:47:05.698, Speaker C: They're like, I'm fucking saving you. Like it's Fort Knox, and I'm not doing anything because I'm gonna get rocked and I really relate to that. And you might even get hacked or rocked or whatever. Not out of, like, bad intent, you know, from those developers, just because of an oversight. And the oversight can be tiny. And it's like the. The chicken that goes to, you know, the Thanksgiving.
00:47:05.698 - 00:47:25.524, Speaker C: To turkey, not the chicken. Fuck. I'm not american. You hear the Thanksgiving turkey? Like, we feed him, we feed him, he's getting fat, and he's super happy, and then the next day he gets killed. You know, he gets the capacity, and then it's like that. That's the same with your defi holdings. Everything goes really well, and you're borrowing, and it goes awesome.
00:47:25.524 - 00:47:50.812, Speaker C: And then the next day, there's a hack and $100 million is gone. And that's really tough. And we need to improve and mature as an ecosystem. And I believe we will. We will figure out those parameters and software will get better. But you cannot make something completely decentralized without some kind of impulse or some kind of controls. Right? A kill switch or whatever.
00:47:50.812 - 00:48:13.894, Speaker C: So it's either or, I believe, and I think people are not made to completely self custody. I believe they're just not. Not responsible enough, man. Like, I know several people who lost their holdings from wallets and shit, too. So I think we need a hybrid model. But I don't know what that hybrid model looks like. But, yeah, so far, my rant.
00:48:16.674 - 00:48:50.076, Speaker D: Yeah, I just think the term defi itself, some people have just a purely allergic reaction. It's kind of the classic immune system response. Just mentally, it's easier for me to simplify my mental framework and say, like, oh, it's just like, I'm not going to look into it further. I'm not going to assess whether it is possible to do this in a way in which I personally feel is kind of justifiable. And so it's just easier to kind of, like, write it off. Write it off. Especially when there have been, as you pointed out, Philip, so many, like, hacks, and, you know, and like, I don't know.
00:48:50.076 - 00:49:09.120, Speaker D: I don't know that we can blame, you know, people for that. But at the same time, I do see cognitive dissonance for sure. And, you know, the people who are like, well, I will happily go to, like, an unchained capital, no shade against unchained capitalism, fantastic company. But I would go to them and happily borrow against my bitcoin.
00:49:09.152 - 00:49:10.280, Speaker A: And yet I'm not willing to do.
00:49:10.312 - 00:49:49.154, Speaker D: That without having to trust them as an intermediary. That I think is pretty objectively incoherent. It's also interesting, I try and draw parallels to peer to peer things. Think of things like this, peer to peer bitcoin buying and selling of a similar thing. Like people perceive that as like decentralized, which to your point Phil, it's like, I don't know what that even means. And again, you know, you're trusting either the person on the other end or some sort of, you know, escrow. Maybe that helps protect you.
00:49:49.154 - 00:50:30.044, Speaker D: So it is, it's interesting, Jake, and I like, I find it hard to rationally say that like, there is no noble aim in defi. I think the term has been bastardized and that is a large part of why you hear these kind of strong visceral reactions against it. But a modern economy needs financial services and that's about it. And ideally we can at least incrementally move along that spectrum of decentralization, even if it's not, you know, all in one fell swoop to this kind of magical end state.
00:50:31.024 - 00:50:51.084, Speaker A: Yep, yep. Great takes. I agree with pretty much all of it. Okay, last topic, although this might be a nothing burger cuz it's too early, but Bob, have you read the bit vm stuff that was just dropped? Could you give us a little bit of Tldr? I have to imagine Ian and Philip have no fucking clue what this is about.
00:50:51.614 - 00:50:55.274, Speaker D: I know BitVM at an incredibly high level. That's it.
00:50:56.374 - 00:51:33.624, Speaker B: So my take so far, there have been a couple articles posted. There have been a lot of discussion in the BitVM telegram, and I have a cursory like I did a quick read of the article, I did a quick glance through all the BITBM comments, lots of discussion going on. I looked at a few of the counterarguments on Twitter, so fairly up to speed. I think the way that they positioned it is pretty poor. They said BitVM bridges are considered unsafe. Saying that it's unsafe is not really accurate. It's not as technically precise as I wish they would have been.
00:51:33.624 - 00:52:08.276, Speaker B: It's more to elicit a negative response, I think, towards BitVM. A lot of their arguments are founded on truth. BitVM in its best form in the bridging case is a trust minimized setup where you have to trust one of many verifiers. And so the whole idea behind BBM is you have better bitcoin bridging, you have this. Rather than relying on an honest majority or a federation, you have this trust minimized. One event verifiers. And maybe you could even be a verifier yourself if you wanted to.
00:52:08.276 - 00:52:56.682, Speaker B: So there's this idea of this trust minimize bitcoin bridge. And BitVM was almost put up on a pedestal of, like, this is the new gold standard of bitcoin bridging. And a lot of bitcoin l two s have since kind of taken this language and said, yes, we're building a BitVM roll up. We're building a BitVM optimistic roll up with the idea that you have better bitcoin bridging. Essentially what the, you know, Udi and others, the tapper wizards argument against BVM, this is why they say it's unsafe, is when you create a BitVM bridge, you have to specify the output address for funds. So the way BiTVM works is you have a prover and you have many verifiers, and you have funds locked in this bridge contract. Those funds can only be sent to the prover.
00:52:56.682 - 00:53:57.770, Speaker B: And so essentially what happens is the prover sends funds and then, I think, is reimbursed. They reimburse themselves essentially using the bridge funds. And so the tapir wizards argument was, in the event that you have a, there's a case where all of the funds are no longer accessible due to the prover essentially not cooperating or going offline or something like that. And I think the mitigation is you can just have a series of BitVM contracts, so you have essentially a backup prover, and the backup prover, you can string together these BitVM implementations. So you always have a backup in the event that something goes wrong. And their argument is that by building this escape hatch, you almost have this bit. VM is not as trust minimized as we all thought.
00:53:57.770 - 00:54:52.164, Speaker B: It shouldn't be placed on this pedestal because you basically have to build an escape hatch in order to ensure that user funds aren't burned. In the event of, like, a bank run, everyone comes in and immediately demands their funds within a specific set amount of time. So I didn't explain that super well, partly because it's been a cursory reading this morning. But their main argument is BitVM is fairly similar to a federation. It's closer to a federation than it is a trust minimized one of n setup, because if everyone goes and wants funds, in some cases you actually don't have the funds. You have to wait for, like a settlement period to then be able to reuse the funds. So it's partly closer to federation, partly users may have to wait for funds.
00:54:52.164 - 00:55:25.226, Speaker B: The general gist is BVM is a very complicated bridging setup that is not very user friendly. Don't think about it like a bridge. Oh, I can easily take my bitcoin in and out whenever I want and it's fast and affordable and awesome. Think about it like, this is the most inaccessible, hardest to use bitcoin bridge of all time, and it might actually give you lower trust assumptions perhaps. That's basically there there argument coming in.
00:55:25.250 - 00:55:46.770, Speaker A: Clutch. With the breakdown, do you think that the federation comparison holds some water? We talked about decentralization on a spectrum and we kind of got to pick how decentralized is ethereum? It's above the midway point. It's pretty decentralized. Do you think the criticism holds some water, that it's closer to a federation for sure.
00:55:46.882 - 00:56:28.868, Speaker B: I think the main argument is, without opcat, bitvm is too hard to use. I think that's generally what they're trying to get at, obviously, because they, you know, they have a horse in the race, they want to get Opcat on bitcoin. But also there's a reason why they picked Opcat, and there's a reason they want Opcat to get into bitcoin. And so they're mainly highlighting BitVM is not what everyone thinks it is. They did it in, like a controversial, like, attention grabbing way, which I don't know that I agree with, but it kind of matches their style and their flair. So I'm not, I'm, I'm not surprised at all, uh, that they would do something like this. Um, and a lot of their points are based in truth.
00:56:28.868 - 00:57:03.960, Speaker B: Like, yes, BitVM is generally a really terrible bitcoin bridge. Um, so it's, it's partly that everyone has idolized BitVM, you know. Um, but in reality, it's just really, really hard to use. And it has some limitations in terms of pro or verifier setup and some limitations on withdrawal times. Kind of like how there's a seven day window for optimistic roll ups, for finality. I mean, it's similar to that. So if given enough time, bitvm might be okay.
00:57:03.960 - 00:57:28.196, Speaker B: But it's all just about trade offs. And they're basically just saying BiTVM is not, is not the silver bullet solution to solve all of our problems on bitcoin. It is far from that. And theyre highlighting a few elements that are all based in truth. And yes, we do need better tooling on bitcoin. I think we need Opcat, Opcat or CTV. I think we need to upgrade bitcoin to do more.
00:57:28.196 - 00:57:43.744, Speaker B: And its obvious people want to do more so anyway, thats the gist of why they did it and why it makes sense to them. And it is all based in, in fact, like this is not just some crazy one off thing. Like there is some truth to it.
00:57:44.644 - 00:57:53.956, Speaker A: So. Yeah, no, that makes sense. I mean it definitely has been the case the past six months. That bit VM has been held up as like, you know, a step change in bridging.
00:57:53.980 - 00:57:55.628, Speaker B: That's going to be like the savior.
00:57:55.796 - 00:58:07.064, Speaker A: And yeah, you trust one pleb off the street who's in that little sequence and you're good to go. But as always, like there's no panacea. It's all design trade offs and it's tricky as shit. And we're still early.
00:58:08.414 - 00:58:08.982, Speaker B: Yep.
00:58:09.078 - 00:58:15.914, Speaker A: Yeah. All roads lead down to bitcoin. All upgrades are apparently bidding down to opcat. We need something though.
00:58:16.334 - 00:58:49.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm just waiting for someone to write the hit piece on runes because runes is being talked about. It's like the best thing ever to happen on bitcoin. Like it's going to solve Defi. We're going to have really fast liquidity pools and amms and all this great stuff. And I'm like, it's just another fungible token standard. It's like RGB or CBRC 20 or counterparty in many ways. And so, yeah, I mean it's going to be great because it's backed by Casey and tons of liquidity is going to get pumped in there, but it's going to be really annoying in a lot of places.
00:58:52.294 - 00:59:15.804, Speaker A: We need a lot more discussions. I mean, these are both not live, so obviously it's too early. But like tapper assets versus rune is going to be like a huge narrative over the next year because both of those have like different, huge user bases, different design. They're very different. Like one l, one focused opera, turn one directly on lightning. So that's gonna be a big topic. Well, cool.
00:59:15.804 - 00:59:28.344, Speaker A: Any last thoughts, gentlemen, before you close this down? No fun time. That's perfect. This is usually how it ends. We just go, okay, cool. That's the podcast and then we close it out. So thank. Thank you guys for coming on.
00:59:28.344 - 00:59:30.644, Speaker A: This has been excellent. Good to see you guys.
00:59:31.504 - 00:59:32.368, Speaker D: Likewise, guys.
00:59:32.456 - 00:59:32.984, Speaker C: Cheers. Cheers.
