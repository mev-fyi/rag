00:00:00.720 - 00:00:23.358, Speaker A: All right, team, we are like an hour behind. Okay. It's crypto, right? Let's live loose a little bit, I guess. So we're talking about account abstraction now. Again, guys, we're gonna have to keep this short. Francesco, no worries. All right, so as the chairs are being tetrised on the stage, quick intros to everyone.
00:00:23.358 - 00:00:37.430, Speaker A: Francesco, he's coming up. He is our dev rel lead. At consensus, we have Zi Wang from timeless wallet, and Isaac, who is from particle network. So welcome, guys. Come on up. You can start.
00:00:43.570 - 00:00:59.926, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Susie, for the kind intros. How many of you guys are into account instruction? Okay, how many of you guys building smart accounts? Okay, a couple of people seems relevant people in the panel today. Let's start with a quick round of intros.
00:01:00.078 - 00:01:07.570, Speaker C: I'm Zee, founder of Timeless Wallet. We're predominantly focusing on the social layer using account traction.
00:01:08.390 - 00:01:15.650, Speaker D: Hey, I'm Isaac, BD, manager at particle network. We're building products in the account abstraction and chain abstraction space.
00:01:16.270 - 00:01:39.216, Speaker B: Sounds good. So let's start quickly. I think everybody's a little bit in the ecosystem. So what's the current state of 4.37 and the kind of cascade eips 7702. What's happening? Just also quick context. We co started back in the days, 437 mafia with some other friends.
00:01:39.216 - 00:01:50.530, Speaker B: We're quite active also in the EAP. Kind of like what's happening. But I want to ask you guys, what's the current state? Where do you see things is going? Are we the right direction?
00:01:52.390 - 00:02:16.470, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we've done a really good job of sort of creating this standard of 4337 being the primary account abstraction standard, especially help through things like 4337 mafia and other AA groups. And I think it's really important to have this unified standardization so that different products have interoperability.
00:02:17.730 - 00:02:47.650, Speaker C: So I think we're still in the kind of the first state phase. I mean, we decided swipe left in the sense that, I mean, for the longest time, everything's ua. I think the general market, from a technical perspective, I think everyone appreciate AA. I think that was kind of the Vitala, kind of effectively did usher that process. Right. But from a consumer adoption perspective, I think I personally and one of my community managers also down there, we answered about 24,000 messages, support messages in the past six months. I think there's a lot of education.
00:02:47.650 - 00:03:11.140, Speaker C: So the adoption curve, I think probably the biggest bottleneck that was solved was 4844 Windsors blob. That did reduce the gas fee. And I think the lenient team also did a great job. But I think the next step is really continuing to educate the user benefits. I think the conversation for the past twelve months about the technical advancement, I think that does have settled.
00:03:11.480 - 00:03:38.750, Speaker B: Yeah, there is a big debate around sense mo two about modular accounts. It's very interesting what's happening. And by the way, what other AA accounts? I'm joking. You mentioned there is a lot of AA accounts, but 437 mafia has been quite leading the way in terms of technical debates. But cool. You touched a little bit on challenges. What are the challenges do we see both for users and developers today building those use case?
00:03:39.730 - 00:04:00.354, Speaker C: Yeah. So in terms of challenging, I think the good thing is this. There is 7702. There is also even native account abstractions. I think that might be one of the key topics we talked about probably maybe by the next e denver in terms of some of the technical components. For example, the swapping between Eoa and Aa. I think Vitalik talked about quite extensively a couple of weeks ago.
00:04:00.354 - 00:04:29.180, Speaker C: Right. Then there's even the native, the account abstraction connecting with passkey. I think that has always been somewhat challenging because not all the network support is on the r curve. So you can't actually abstract away the login do, let's say, the secure enclave. Again, there's still some technical debts and some of the clarity that needs to be continued to be made more clearly to the developers and builders out there.
00:04:29.920 - 00:04:38.980, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I definitely second that, especially with the passkeys. I think that's where we see the most technical debt.
00:04:40.440 - 00:05:12.748, Speaker B: Yeah, I think also journeys wise we see users having specific journey needs. So I think also customizing this wallet journey is very important and we see a lot that with the snaps that a lot of people are just interesting in getting on board with security snaps. Some people are actually using a lot, some snapdra and then depends what the user want. Right. And I remember you guys from back was last year or something. You integrate with telegrams also on a specific social part. I really like that from timeless.
00:05:12.748 - 00:05:20.180, Speaker B: Can you expand a little bit on this social narrative that you guys are building around timeless a little bit more?
00:05:20.300 - 00:06:08.604, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's really the next step in terms. We got to the pain point now the question is once the user starts using account traction, what are some of the additional benefits? One of the things is basically, for example, you can theoretically log into a new account tractor wallet using your Telegram login with secondary backup authentication. That's one benefit, the native integration with telegram directly within the wallet. That means you can send tokens now from one user to another. And you can also use counterfactual wallet creation. I think these are some of just the general benefits that for the general users out there, they don't really care about the technical aspect like what, what's the benefit to me? Right. And then I think some of the newer, exciting announcement that we're about to make in the next couple of weeks is the integration with forecaster and lens.
00:06:08.604 - 00:06:35.324, Speaker C: So within the wallet you have access to, you can actually make a post, you can actually use the frame to make a purchase. And no longer are you being kicked out to the different wallethood to authenticate, to kind of sign the transaction request. You can do so directly within the wallet. And the approval, it's just a biometric scan. You no longer have to actually type in your private key or do all that stuff. Right. So I think the next twelve months is exciting.
00:06:35.324 - 00:06:44.920, Speaker C: Hopefully by next year when we get invited back, we'll be talking more about, okay, we got like another 10 million users who are actually getting the benefits of account abstraction.
00:06:45.260 - 00:06:46.548, Speaker B: One year. Go for it.
00:06:46.684 - 00:07:10.400, Speaker D: Yeah, that's awesome. I think that's a perfect use case for AA. These consumer facing Dapps where you want to onboard these users who may not have experience with private keys or may not have a metamask. So especially with the biometrics, I think that's a really cool development of AA as well.
00:07:11.550 - 00:07:23.926, Speaker B: Sounds good. I was checking my laptop that got automatically dropped by the wind and I was more concerned. And by the way, one year in crypto is like, we are meeting each other. Next year will be like so many evolutions, huh?
00:07:24.118 - 00:07:41.688, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think there are ambitions, basically. Can we get to 10 million? I mean, it seems like a crazy number. Last year when we were talking to the NIA team, we're dancing around like maybe 100,000. I think in six months we got up to about 1.5 million. So I think with the right support, with the right campaign, I think we can get to 10 million even on.
00:07:41.704 - 00:07:57.740, Speaker B: Lena, like what, two, three weeks ago we reached the 1 billion TVL. And if you think about that, these ECCs when we went Mainnet last year, it's quite crazy how much time is in terms of evolution and the development feature updates are happening.
00:07:58.040 - 00:08:29.978, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think some of the. I was just talking to you offstage about some of the technical advancements. I think in terms of progression is definitely a puncture with equilibrium, meaning it's boring, it's painful. It's boring, it's painful until you get to a point where everything seems to click because it was last year at E Denver, Vitalik said, oh, like we're thinking about supporting you, 4337. And by the time we got to Paris, everyone's already started supporting. And by the time you get to September, there's probably like 1520 different wallets deciding to support AA.
00:08:29.978 - 00:08:49.582, Speaker C: So I think that's kind of the moment we're looking for in terms of like, okay, some of the newer ideas, native passkey support, biometrics, smart account, universal smart accounts. I think those are the side conversations are happening offstage, and by the time you get to onstage, then I think that's kind of what sparks really happen in terms of adoption.
00:08:49.726 - 00:09:21.860, Speaker B: Yeah, we see also like batch transactions, for example, is a big use case, especially on gamer back in the days. That's even like on Metamask. That's why also SDK kind of like exists, because a lot of people are going back to WorldConnect. They're literally signing every transaction. And when you're in a specific baying game like North Forest or something, you want to be able to sign auto sign for specific transaction and best transact. You touched a bit on universal accounts, and particle has been a big advocate on that. Can you give us, I think that's a big, big topic.
00:09:21.860 - 00:09:26.340, Speaker B: What are universal accounts? How particle is supporting today.
00:09:27.030 - 00:10:38.900, Speaker D: Yeah, so I look at it as account abstraction, solve the user onboarding problem in crypto, making it easy for users to log in with social accounts, interact with Dapps without having to pay gas fees. However, we realize that this only sort of solves the first step. And when users want to transact across chains, there's still a lot of difficulty, there's fragmentation, and even for experienced defi users, bridging is not fun. So really, I think the next evolution of this will be now that we've already abstracted away the account experience, the next step is abstracting away the chain experience, giving users a unified balance across chains where they can seamlessly interact without having to worry about, you know, having funds on a certain chain and wanting to do a transaction where they may not have gas. It should just be this seamless user experience. And yeah, that's really what we're building towards. And excited to bring chain abstraction to chains like Linia.
00:10:39.760 - 00:11:12.118, Speaker B: Super exciting. Yeah. And just to closing up and opening up some question here for the audience. So what's coming next in terms of from timeless side particle side, you mentioned also dropping some alphas there, but in terms of needs for the ecosystem, we're getting so many feedbacks from the community are you guys looking forward for some specific features, updates or feature needs that people are not building or you guys are looking into it during pull out.
00:11:12.134 - 00:12:02.116, Speaker C: My future request list. So I was talking to Marco last night and I know Emma's down there. Obviously one of the key things that we, from our perspective for the next 180 days, would love to see linear supporting, let's say build up a layer three. So we're already kind of in design phase because we need certain level of performance characteristics, ultra low gas fee, even like compressing the gas fee, even lower supporting things like ZK Snark, validium to optimize for what we focus on, which is the social aspect, then specifically for the users. These are some of the things that we're looking to bring to Linea. For example, I think most of us have heard about pump fun hamster combat. Those social five features we're looking to integrate directly within timeless.
00:12:02.116 - 00:12:38.180, Speaker C: Hopefully that's a win win win for Linea, obviously generate additional interactions, gas fees for the users. Again, whether it being just comfort of money, or for the entertainment, or maybe for the alpha, I think that's beneficial to the end users. And ultimately for us, it also wins. That means we're giving what of all the past year and a half of hard work. We're actually continuing delivering durable revenue for our project, but also making sure we have enough ammunition to engage the users on an ongoing basis. So those are kind of the three key vectors we're thinking about how to make continuum made progress.
00:12:39.520 - 00:13:08.740, Speaker D: Yeah, for us, we're sort of laser focused on universal accounts. We're currently live on Testnet, so if anyone wants to go play around with them, get a feel for this idea, use our universal gas token. And we're aiming to go live on Mainnet in about three months. So I think for us it's just about aligning with the chains and the initial projects. Who will support universal accounts to have a really strong rollout of the product.
00:13:10.040 - 00:13:21.460, Speaker B: Nice. Could not finish up better with this. Kind of like, how does the future look like? Any question, guys, I know that. Let's have some sizey questions before we're closing out the panel.
00:13:23.600 - 00:13:24.500, Speaker C: You good?
00:13:25.200 - 00:13:27.024, Speaker B: I think we're good. Awesome.
00:13:27.072 - 00:13:27.672, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:13:27.776 - 00:13:29.860, Speaker B: For the first time, we're closing a bit earlier.
00:13:30.340 - 00:13:31.620, Speaker C: We just shaved off two minutes.
