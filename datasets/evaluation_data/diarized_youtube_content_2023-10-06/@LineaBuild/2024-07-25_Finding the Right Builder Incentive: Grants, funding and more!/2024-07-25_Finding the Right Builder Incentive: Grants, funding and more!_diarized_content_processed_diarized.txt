00:00:05.400 - 00:00:27.142, Speaker A: All right, Lauren, now you guys are up. All right, so next thing we're going to talk about is builder incentives. Are you guys devs? Raise your hand if you're a dev. Anyone here at Dev? Ooh, devs in the house. Way to show up. Thanks, guys. We're talking about builder incentives.
00:00:27.142 - 00:00:55.346, Speaker A: I don't know. You probably know this, but Linia does not have a grants program, which is very controversial. So they will be discussing that as well as what builders really, truly need. Is it just cold, hard cash, Lorne? We will find out in one moment. Once these chairs are up, please sit under your picture so it's not weird. Thank you. Also, we are, like, very far behind.
00:00:55.346 - 00:01:12.100, Speaker A: We're very late. It's on brand for crypto, but we might just cut the panel a little bit short. All right, come on up, guys. I feel like you should run on and I should introduce. No, just joking. Lauren Dutton is here from consensus. Come on down, Lauren.
00:01:12.100 - 00:01:33.632, Speaker A: Lauren is our amazing developer advocate, a good friend of mine, a beautiful person inside and out. Thank you so much for moderating this panel. Yes. Raul, that is you. Ah, look behind you. Who is that? Quickly, all three of these companies you have heard of, right, they're all pretty essential for devs. We have Chainlink, Covalent, and third web.
00:01:33.632 - 00:01:43.384, Speaker A: Huge names, don't even need any introductions. But Raul is from Chainlink. Hello, Raul. Thank you for being here. Leigh from Covalent. Thank you for being here. And Gary from third web, thank you also for being here.
00:01:43.384 - 00:01:43.808, Speaker A: Hello.
00:01:43.904 - 00:01:51.460, Speaker B: Okay, look at that. All right. So then, without any further ado, let's do a quick round of introductions. Show us your product, let us know. What are you guys all working on?
00:01:52.090 - 00:01:53.178, Speaker A: You want to start it off, Robert?
00:01:53.194 - 00:02:07.830, Speaker C: I can go first. So, my name is Raul Hipper. I'm a senior technical account manager at Chainlink Labs. What that means is I do two things. I manage our relationship with Aave compound, GMX, and syncytix. And I work on our data streams, low latency oracle. So our super latency oracle for prep, Texas.
00:02:08.610 - 00:02:25.460, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Leigh. This is my colleague, Jane. But we're both at Covalent. We have a decentralized network for data infrastructure, and I work on product, on our API. So if you build apps on over 200 chains, you might have used Covalent API.
00:02:26.200 - 00:02:36.660, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Gary from third web. We're a full stack developer platform, and my role is to support you developers on getting your product to market and then scale it up without debris, like, without any issues.
00:02:37.400 - 00:02:38.080, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:02:38.200 - 00:02:45.060, Speaker B: So, in all of your experience, how are developers choosing which stacks to build on, which networks to go to? What does that process look like?
00:02:45.880 - 00:02:53.982, Speaker C: I think it's a, I mean, the first step is does it actually have the features? Which is not always the case in crypto. It also depends on what kind of builder we're talking about.
00:02:54.006 - 00:02:54.142, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:54.166 - 00:03:03.950, Speaker C: So if a project is looking at, where do I deploy? If you look at, for example, the Aave Dao, where does it deploy? Incentives rarely play into it like direct financial incentives. It's usually.
