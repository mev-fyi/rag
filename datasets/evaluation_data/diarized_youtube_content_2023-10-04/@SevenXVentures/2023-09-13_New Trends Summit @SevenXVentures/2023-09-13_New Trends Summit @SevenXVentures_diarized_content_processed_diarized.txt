00:00:40.360 - 00:00:45.288, Speaker A: Hi, Jasper. Can you hear me clearly? Yep. Thank you, Eric.
00:00:45.288 - 00:00:50.830, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for checking. Okay, that's great. Cool.
00:00:50.830 - 00:01:05.510, Speaker A: I think we have all the project teams here, so let's get started. If you have any additional technical difficulty or know, just let me know, or anyone else on a team know. I think that'll do it.
00:01:05.510 - 00:01:16.424, Speaker A: Cool. Well, GM to all the brilliant minds from across the world, whether it's morning for you or evening for you, GM or GN. So welcome to the Natural Hackathon Demo day.
00:01:16.424 - 00:01:43.916, Speaker A: So, my name is Harry, co founder of Hackquest, and I'll be your host for the Demo Day. Before diving into today's speeches and team presentations, let's give a special round of applauses and thanks to our hackathon host co host as well as the organizer. So, we have Seven X Ventures as the host, dojo, Mud, Hat Quest as the co hosts, and Moonshot Commons as the organizer.
00:01:43.916 - 00:01:59.030, Speaker A: A quick introduction. So Seven X Ventures is a Web three fund based both in Asia and Americas, founded back in 2020. Currently, Seven X Ventures manages three direct investment funds and one fund with a total AUM of nearly $300 million.
00:01:59.030 - 00:02:11.972, Speaker A: Dojo is that crypto game engine. It is a community built provable game engine and toolchain for building onchain games and autonomous worlds. Mud is a framework for ambitious ethereum applications.
00:02:11.972 - 00:02:32.860, Speaker A: It compresses the complexity of building EVM apps with a tightly integrated software stack. Hatquest is a Web Three developer education platform onboarding everyone, developers and nondevelopers to the world of Web three. Last but not the least, Minshaw Commons is a global community for Web Three founders to learn, build and skill.
00:02:32.860 - 00:02:51.312, Speaker A: Special thanks to all the media community partners. We have BlockBeats Odaily pond News Techflow Chin Catcher Foresight News sigmund Fault Upchain Community lxdao four four. Dow blockchain at ng blockchain at HEC.
00:02:51.312 - 00:03:14.300, Speaker A: Raybase openbuild. Chen IDE modal block. Booster and for our official hackathon partners, we have mass network, particle network, caldera Meal, World, menta network, chen base, ARPA network builder, dow loot chain, exterior, polyhedra delphina's lab corio.
00:03:14.300 - 00:03:24.540, Speaker A: We have eStorage parmadao Tintiland AW research. Mvgg Ventures. Now on to the judges.
00:03:24.540 - 00:04:58.030, Speaker A: We have ICO from Folius Ventures bowen from Smurdy Lab chris from Mayo World evans from Arkan Group, eraser funding partner from Seven X ventures forrest from Timing Ventures felix from ARPA Network geltigoza from Topology, GM from Dragonfly jay from Lettuce, jenny from Animoca Brands jimbo from HashKey, kevin from Hackstao from Parallel Ventures komarabi from AW Hacker House louis Song from Seven X Ventures mike from Agriculture gold dow matt from Caldera, nick from YGG Ventures nicholas from Bitcraft pong yuang from Particle Network sijo from eStorage caesars from Femblocks sikh gao from Defiance Labs shremi from Dojo tommy from Spartan tieran from Mass Network victor from Meta Network will Robinson from Aliens dao yu tian Chen from Initiate Capital yi jachun from Choreo and Yoni from Matchbox dao onto the prizes So we will have overall Excellence Award, best Commercial Value Award, most Innovative Idea Award and just a special award. So all the prizes, please note, will actually be distributed and announced within the week afterwards, either the Telegram Group or WeChat Group or email. So you will be announced not directly after the hackathon, but within the week.
00:04:58.030 - 00:05:16.336, Speaker A: So now onto a quick opening speech. So, for the natural hackathon, we received registrations from hundreds of participants from across the world. Eventually, we selected 75 of you, 75 projects that showcased the talent of 150 outstanding builders.
00:05:16.336 - 00:05:41.068, Speaker A: And during the competition, the startup project teams really actively participated in ten different workshops sponsored by the community. These workshops range from topics like game development, AI and plus Web Three, allowing the teams to really gain that in depth knowledge and understanding. Furthermore, they received valuable guidance from industry experts resulting in, I'll say, significant improvement in the quality of their project products.
00:05:41.068 - 00:06:06.340, Speaker A: And now today, after serious couple of weeks of building, we carefully chose 18 projects from two different tracks to be presented on Metro Day. Well, before we dive into all the exciting pitches, let's welcome the founding partner of Seven X Ventures, Eraser, to give a host speech. Eraser, the floor is all yours.
00:06:06.340 - 00:06:15.316, Speaker A: Thank you. And thank you everyone. Welcome to our Nitro Hackathons Demo Day.
00:06:15.316 - 00:06:29.992, Speaker A: So welcome all the guests, the builders, sponsors, partners. So I think I'll have a thank list. First of all, it's the builders and we have more than 150 builders all across the world to attend our hackathon.
00:06:29.992 - 00:06:51.872, Speaker A: So we have actually 75 teams, they have done a very credible job and they done a very interesting project. So later they can be shown in this demo day. And second of all, I want to thank our partners, our sponsors, without you, this could not be happened.
00:06:51.872 - 00:07:21.916, Speaker A: So thank to Dojo, Mud, Moonshot and Heckquest and also our sponsors as Agld, Particle Network and Arcade Network. And third of all, I think I want to thank all the speakers who actually give the workshops to our community, to our builders community. So we held more than ten workshops together to share knowledge, to share experiences and insights to our hackers, our builders community.
00:07:21.916 - 00:07:57.296, Speaker A: I think everyone can learn a lot from what are the frontiers in the areas that you're building on, especially on those two topics that we focus that is actually the fully on Chain game and AI plus Web Three. So then I think I'll give kind of like introduction about Seven Next Ventures and also Nitro Hackerson and Nitro, why we caught Nitro. So basically seven decks, I think we already introduced that we actually started from three years ago.
00:07:57.296 - 00:08:30.524, Speaker A: But right now I think I want to give idea about why we caught Seven X because a lot of people actually ask me, so is this for your return? Is this like you actually want a Seven X return on your investment? I said, no, it's not like that. So I think our job, our responsibility is actually to connect the western part of the world and the eastern part of world, especially from the builders community, from the entrepreneur community and from the tech community. So basically seven is a magic number both in western culture and eastern culture.
00:08:30.524 - 00:09:15.216, Speaker A: So in western culture, everybody knows that God uses seven deads to create the world, right? And in the eastern culture we have one saying from the Buddhism that is Buddha walk every seven steps and lotus flower blooming at his feet means that actually when you met something that is so difficult in your life that you cannot go with it. So basically you need to actually go and continue for another seven steps and then you may see all the peace and results for your hardworking. So basically that's why we're using seven as our magic number and our name to actually combine the two cultures together and actually try to build a bridge in between.
00:09:15.216 - 00:09:44.820, Speaker A: So NX definitely means infinity. And also why Nitro? I think everybody heard like everybody knows that nitrogen is actually the accelerator for racing cars, right? And also nitrogen is the element, I think the fundamental element also in the fertilizer. Basically people know that nitrogen is actually the 7th element in the periodic table of elements.
00:09:44.820 - 00:10:16.480, Speaker A: So basically that's why we're using Nitro actually as a name, brand name for our hacker house and also use Nitro as our symbol for all the events that semX is going to build, that we have for builders, we have for entrepreneurs, and also for the promising future that we could bring together, we could actually build together. So actually Nitro hacker houses brand or Nitro hackers on this brand is going to be a long term brand. It's not only for once or for twice.
00:10:16.480 - 00:10:32.932, Speaker A: We already held a hacker house in Bay Area that is about intent topic, which is a very hot topic recently during the Stanford Blockchain week. And then this is our second hacker zone, second event. That is a natural day Hackerson.
00:10:32.932 - 00:11:11.700, Speaker A: We have focused on the fully on chain game and AI plus web three, which are the two kind of like very innovative and very kind of like even experimental frontier of this industry. So like I said, it's going to be a very long term thing and we want the Nitro itself, this brand, this image, this symbol to be the home for all the builders across the world. And definitely and if you have any questions, if you have any interesting projects, interesting ideas, interesting kind of technology, please come to find us.
00:11:11.700 - 00:11:37.788, Speaker A: And definitely we'll kind of welcome you in the next Nitro event, which we think that will hold at least two of those large events every year, maybe three. So basically if you have any questions, like I said, any kind of comment, please find me. I'll hand it over back to the host and hope you enjoy this event.
00:11:37.788 - 00:11:51.680, Speaker A: Hope everybody done a good job here and yeah, thank you very much. Well, thank you, Razor. Please give your Razor a round of applause, virtual applauses or actual applauses if you're in person at the venue.
00:11:51.680 - 00:12:06.984, Speaker A: Well now, without further ado, let's dive into the project pitches. And just to recap the logistics, each pitch has a four minute limit and a 1 minute Q A from the judges. So if you do run over, I'll have to cut you off.
00:12:06.984 - 00:12:15.880, Speaker A: So, yeah, let's make sure you stick to that limit. Well, first of all, we have cellula. Yes.
00:12:15.880 - 00:12:32.588, Speaker A: Can I share your screen? Yep, absolutely. I'll start a timer once you yeah, okay. Can you see the screen? Yep, I'm sharing.
00:12:32.588 - 00:12:37.824, Speaker A: Okay. Hello everyone. Great honor to kick off today's demo Day.
00:12:37.824 - 00:12:53.216, Speaker A: And this is Erica from Cellular. I have six years in blockchain product design and I have created a variety of pioneer anti products with Devil Labs and Wheelchot. And I'm leading the team with rich experience in anti.
00:12:53.216 - 00:13:14.444, Speaker A: So Stellar is a fully onto autonomous live simulated strategy game. And we are using the man engine so players can culture and involve unique life forms and employ various strategies to survive and compete with each other. So I will start from why we are so interested in artificial life.
00:13:14.444 - 00:13:33.140, Speaker A: We believe that life is a behavior, not a substance. So life is composed of simple behaviors, not simple substance. Therefore, we can ignore the influence of matter and abstract the logic, the matter rules that controls life just like the convict scheme of life.
00:13:33.140 - 00:13:48.932, Speaker A: So life can exist in cells, in memory and even for lunch. So in Cellular, players can create a variety of artificial life with diverse forms and shape combining and establishing the smallest unit of cells. Yes, this is the cells.
00:13:48.932 - 00:14:09.564, Speaker A: All the cells are three by three matrix and it's controlled by the four metal rules in the convoy scheme of life. So it's just like the legal bricks in Minecraft or minecraft. So players can observe these life, grow, reproduce and involve in the virtual space of life.
00:14:09.564 - 00:14:41.764, Speaker A: So it's up to you to decide which piece of the cells you will choose and the different combinations and different kind of cells will lead to different kind of life. And at Cellular we make Mt composability as for the principle, so it's up to you to decide how life will evolve in different environmental vectors. And after all the life forms will synthesize by the players will become characters in the strategy different kind of games.
00:14:41.764 - 00:15:24.128, Speaker A: The first game we started is simulation strategy game is called AW Pagman and building upon the worldview of Pagman, players will transform their game characters into AI agents with autonomous decision making capabilities. Through the combination of different strategies they will emerge in PvP battles with others in the random generated maps. So this is actually this roadmap or distinct bottom up approach just like the youth way will lead the life as a core game asset and enable Life to evolve into a virtual game character across different kind of games.
00:15:24.128 - 00:15:50.984, Speaker A: So as the variety of the game types expand, the high frequency of the crafting of the loose will size the network value with our transaction fee. So this is a brief introduction of Stellar, and I will give a demo. And during this pixel, we developed the first simulation schedule.
00:15:50.984 - 00:16:00.930, Speaker A: Game of stellar. Can you see the screen I'm sharing? Yes. Okay.
00:16:00.930 - 00:16:39.600, Speaker A: This is the parting way of Life. The first stage is the TV game, and all the life you cross from the cartoon table will become the same characters in this game. So the lightning curve here from the live will become the life point.
00:16:39.600 - 00:16:58.564, Speaker A: Every game character has two abilities. One eric, sorry to interrupt, but we're actually over the time now. Okay, yeah.
00:16:58.564 - 00:17:07.544, Speaker A: Thank you for going through this. Maybe wrap up in roughly 10 seconds or so and then we can pass it on to the next group for Q and A. Okay.
00:17:07.544 - 00:17:24.300, Speaker A: I can play the video, right? No. Yeah, I guess now is the time. So if anyone has any questions from our judges, please raise your hand or directly unmute yourself.
00:17:24.300 - 00:17:43.224, Speaker A: We can go from there. Any questions from our judges? Okay, this is the AW all the eric, sorry. Your time stop.
00:17:43.224 - 00:17:54.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is over the time. So all the other teams, make sure to pay attention to chat. If you're listening to this, I will give a 1 minute signal.
00:17:54.560 - 00:18:03.172, Speaker A: When you see the one signal sign, make sure to start wrapping up. If you keep going, I would have to cut you off. All right, cool.
00:18:03.172 - 00:18:09.320, Speaker A: Thank you, Eric. Okay, cool. Our next team is Blake Dow.
00:18:09.320 - 00:18:18.810, Speaker A: All right, testing, testing. Is the mic work OK? Yep, it works perfectly fine. All right, let me share screen.
00:18:18.810 - 00:18:26.990, Speaker A: Does it work? Yep. All right, cool. I think we're good to go.
00:18:26.990 - 00:18:33.836, Speaker A: Morning. We're the team behind Blade out. We're fully on Chain game Studio, working around the L two tech stacks.
00:18:33.836 - 00:18:55.888, Speaker A: Today we're presenting the first fully on chain real time PvP Battle Rail game feature of this game. It has very deep loot NFT integrations, where you can turn Realms maps into NFTs, or you can turn Genesis Adventures into your characters. Every tile, every action, every move is fully on chain.
00:18:55.888 - 00:19:14.444, Speaker A: So the playstyle is actually pretty straightforward. You'll be spawning on the map, you'll be looting loot boxes, you'll be chatting with your friends and then scheming against each other or work together. And then until you fight each other, until there's one person last standing, and then that person will take away all the stakes that they previously staked in the game.
00:19:14.444 - 00:19:32.576, Speaker A: We'll showcase the game a little bit later, but then network. For now, we'll talk about technical considerations. Right, so this game, we design it for quick design, iterations in mind, quick play testing, and then also to try to bring out on chain gaming characteristics.
00:19:32.576 - 00:20:03.976, Speaker A: So some of the common considerations is that burner wallet we are working closely with the rollout service provider to create an in session private key. And then we register this private key on a gasless chain on a registry contract and then we give players a faucet to get their funds and then start playing. Secondly, we take some consideration, learn something from Mud and Dojo.
00:20:03.976 - 00:20:33.296, Speaker A: We index some of the game state on the front end browser so that we can have quick retrieval of the game state. Thirdly, we design each wallet to only be limited to one game session so that we try to lower the amount of bots on the game itself. Now the fourth and fifth point is about bringing out some the awareness of blockchain gaming and on chain transactions.
00:20:33.296 - 00:21:07.500, Speaker A: So we have took a piece from Skyscrive, we have this move intent transaction timer, something like Skyscribe so that players can show their move intent. And then we batch push the transaction on chain so that we can sort of foster the paradigm or the gaming culture awareness of blockchain gaming. And then lastly, we have this proxy contract whereby we hold user achievements and then game logic.
00:21:07.500 - 00:21:37.372, Speaker A: But in the event that we want to upgrade the contract, we can do that and then still retain user achievements. So what we've learned is that with the rollout service provider RPC hubrids are very delicate because we're not like a term based game, we're like a synchronous simultaneous game. So we are still optimizing on that and working closely with the robot service provider to learn about these many age cases when we're developing game.
00:21:37.372 - 00:22:03.312, Speaker A: So we realized that it's very important to have incremental design improvements and then keep testing with your internal test team and then build up your internal game testing community as well. And lastly, we learned a lot from Mud and Dojo devtooling. So we're trying to incorporate a lot of the design patterns into a game still learning over there.
00:22:03.312 - 00:22:16.872, Speaker A: Okay, all right, cool. Let's see the game. You'll be basically staking and then into the game and then as you can see here, all the console, all the chain states are refreshed and then map states are refreshed in real time.
00:22:16.872 - 00:22:35.884, Speaker A: So the yellow boxes you hear is the intent based mechanism where you basically be signaling your willingness to move to a certain tile. And then after the chain state monitor listen to this blockchain state, you'll be basically executing that transaction. And then what you see here is actually the red player is actually dodging the attacks as you can see.
00:22:35.884 - 00:22:56.164, Speaker A: And then we were talking in the chat room about which player we should take out first. And then lastly, you'll be basically seeing me trying to chase down this red player and then ended up finishing the red player. And then lastly and then there's this green player that ended up taking the first place and that's basically per game is like two to three minutes.
00:22:56.164 - 00:23:06.810, Speaker A: It's fast paced, you can play with your friend. It's actually live. So definitely try to follow us, DM us and then on Twitter and then for a play test access.
00:23:06.810 - 00:23:18.476, Speaker A: And that wraps up our presentation about the game, about the technical considerations. Then we'll open the floor to any questions. Perfect.
00:23:18.476 - 00:23:40.294, Speaker A: That's actually exactly time. So any questions from our judges? Well, give it 30 seconds and feel free to type it in the chat. If you're not at a position to unmute, actually see Sebastian unmuted.
00:23:40.294 - 00:23:49.966, Speaker A: I don't know. Do you have a question or is it by mistake? Okay, no worries. Sounds good.
00:23:49.966 - 00:23:55.806, Speaker A: Well, thank you. Thank you Alex. Thank you, Blade Dow and the team.
00:23:55.806 - 00:24:18.200, Speaker A: Next one we have Branch Clash. And actually, before we dive into that, I saw Eric from Cellula actually posted the demo video in the chat, so I know you weren't able to finish that. So judges, if you do want to take a look, that link is available.
00:24:18.200 - 00:24:29.960, Speaker A: Next one we have Branch Clash. Okay. Can you see that? Yes.
00:24:29.960 - 00:24:36.518, Speaker A: Okay. Hello everyone. It's a great pleasure to participate in this hack zone.
00:24:36.518 - 00:24:48.158, Speaker A: Our project is called Branch Clash, a fully on chain tower defense game. And our team are from the Human Crypto Society Lab. Our leader is Professor Tai and he is also the head of the lab.
00:24:48.158 - 00:25:03.540, Speaker A: I'm a PH student and I did my undergrad and master at Tsinghua University. Real Li is a MPhil student in our lab and Yanzhong is an undergrad student from our school. So first, let me introduce why we create such a game.
00:25:03.540 - 00:25:22.502, Speaker A: As we all know, blockchain game initially gained traction due to the P Two E model. Most blockchain game adopt this model with game mechanism central around buying, nurturing and selling NFTs. However, as such projects become mainstream, blockchain Game began to face criticism.
00:25:22.502 - 00:25:49.010, Speaker A: P Two E has lead both players and companies to prioritize money, often at the expense of the core enjoyment of gaming. Therefore, we are endeavoring to explore a new native mechanism of 40 on chain game which can offer unique enjoyment that is not primarily driven by economic incentives. So let's watch a short video that introduced this new mechanism.
00:25:49.010 - 00:26:13.078, Speaker A: Branch Clash is can hear the watch tower defense blockchain game that features a new collaboration mechanism called chain collaboration. This game mechanism requires players to engage in both cooperation and competition with other players without an emphasis on economic incentives. The game starts with two initial levels corresponding to two player groups tree trunk mode, representing setting up tower defense and tree root mode representing adding debuffs.
00:26:13.078 - 00:26:40.062, Speaker A: To prevent tower defense players from passing the level, each player must select an existing level and inherit all its attributes, including tower layout, money, and debuffs to play the next difficulty level. After that, the player's new strategy in the level state when they passed it will form a new level, waiting for other players to choose this new level will be added to the chain structure after its parent level. When multiple players select the same level to begin playing, then newly created levels will fork.
00:26:40.062 - 00:27:00.614, Speaker A: As additional players create more levels, the game will exhibit a treelike structure composed of multiple chains that originate from the same initial levels. The longest chain in this process is deemed the main chain and will be distinguished by a unique color. Furthermore, for the levels at the tree root only, the main chain's debuffs will be activated, affecting the levels at the corresponding height on the trunk chain.
00:27:00.614 - 00:27:28.890, Speaker A: Collaboration requires players to cooperate with other players on the same chain while competing against players from different branches or modes aiming to extend their own chain. Okay, so how do we implement this game? First, because the data is crucial in this gameplay, our game is entirely on chain to ensure its realability. In other words, our smart contract can be played at a standalone version.
00:27:28.890 - 00:27:43.050, Speaker A: Certainly we have created a web version to provide a Gui. Since there is a lot of on chain data involved, we have added a server to speed up data retrieval. But it's important to know that this server is solely for data caching.
00:27:43.050 - 00:28:06.460, Speaker A: All interaction and permission check are directly linked to the smart contract. In the web version, we have managed to include almost all aspects of a complete game, ranging from the game background story to the beginner tutorial. And this is the main interface of the game.
00:28:06.460 - 00:28:29.220, Speaker A: And this is instead of the tree trunk level, and this is inside the tree root level. And all of the content mentioned above has been implemented. You can experience it through this domain name.
00:28:29.220 - 00:28:42.280, Speaker A: And thank you all for your attention and interest in our project and we invite you to explore it firsthand. That's all. Thank you to the Branch Clash Team.
00:28:42.280 - 00:29:03.130, Speaker A: Now onto the Q and a portion. Any questions from our judges and eddians? I'll give another 30 seconds or so. Again, please feel free to unmute or raise hand or just type question in the chat.
00:29:03.130 - 00:29:20.900, Speaker A: If not, then we'll move on to Autochasia, I think. NOI, you're up? Yeah. Hi.
00:29:20.900 - 00:29:34.280, Speaker A: Hi. Let me share my screen. Can you see it? Yes.
00:29:34.280 - 00:29:59.310, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Hey guys, very glad to have this opportunity to represent our project audio and great thanks to seven ventures and all sponsors. This is our team conversation.
00:29:59.310 - 00:30:23.318, Speaker A: So about Autocess from early July autochess is designed to be a fully on chain audit chess game. Just like data to audit chess in early stage, we have completed the fundamental gameplay and implemented the basic automatic combat logic for PCs. Besides building nature hackdown, we have added a new and very important feature the general gameplay effect.
00:30:23.318 - 00:30:38.230, Speaker A: So if you have ever played the dotted two autocess, you will quickly understand how to play Autocess here. So basically, we have two play mode. One is PvP, the other one is PvE.
00:30:38.230 - 00:30:58.542, Speaker A: For the PvP mode, players need to form their own camp round by round. You can select from 17 heroes, five rarities, five races and five classes. And a hero have ten attributes in our game like health attack defense.
00:30:58.542 - 00:31:29.630, Speaker A: Et cetera and various hero combination can activate different vicinity effect. For example, if you have two mages in your camp then all enemies defense will be decreased by 20% so this greatly improves the diversity of hero combination then players are forced to combat with others automatically. There are at most eight players within one game.
00:31:29.630 - 00:31:57.186, Speaker A: Each round, you will encounter a random selected player as your opponent, and you can see your camp and your opponent's camp will separately located on the left side and the right side of 88. Chessboard and synergy activities by your camp will be highlighted below. So, some detail about the combat logic.
00:31:57.186 - 00:32:16.250, Speaker A: It is same for all pieces and roughly as follows first ability casting. Second equipment using third, attacking the closest enemy within a spectacular range. At the end, if there is no possible attacking target pieces will move towards to the closest enemy.
00:32:16.250 - 00:32:26.000, Speaker A: But the first two will be added. In the future. So now we just have attack and move.
00:32:26.000 - 00:32:37.714, Speaker A: The other mode is PvE. So in this mode the player's goal is to survive as long as possible. The longer you survive, the more anime pieces there are.
00:32:37.714 - 00:32:56.638, Speaker A: On right side. A new leaderboard feature has been added to the record survival time for all players so they can compete for rank. Here we list some technical highlights of our project like ZK based on chain private matching.
00:32:56.638 - 00:33:15.280, Speaker A: Room GPS, path binding in combat and general gameplay, effect design, AI. Power, hero image and optimistic rendering to give player a smoother experience. So now let's see a demo video.
00:33:15.280 - 00:33:22.058, Speaker A: Hello, players. Let's dive in. The gameplay of auto.
00:33:22.058 - 00:33:27.300, Speaker A: Chain. Now enter. In the page you can see two bottom.
00:33:27.300 - 00:33:47.100, Speaker A: For playing with your friends you can click Create Room, enter name and password. If you are new here and just want to have a try, you can click single play to play with computer. If you have played the auto chess, it will be easy for you to start.
00:33:47.100 - 00:34:23.570, Speaker A: If you are not, we have a simple how to play bottom for you for the game interface you can see your experience then the piece then you can see round and coin in the right there's all players info from game start you can click the auto chamshire to open shop to buy hero here we bought Bar Chinder. Place it on board and wait for the battle to start. Once battle starts, hero will Autofan enemy and auto tag.
00:34:23.570 - 00:34:34.870, Speaker A: One important strategy is how you make your heroes formation. After one turn ends, you will get more. Coin and can buy more heroes.
00:34:34.870 - 00:34:46.650, Speaker A: Synergy. Another strategy shows up. You can choose heroes with the same race or the same class in this way.
00:34:46.650 - 00:35:04.798, Speaker A: All right, here we have Jack. If you want to put the link in the chat as well, similar to Eric, I think that'll be good for anyone who wants to watch the remaining 10 seconds, but yeah. Thank you so much for the presentation.
00:35:04.798 - 00:35:34.070, Speaker A: Any questions from our judges, feel free to unmute or put in the chat. Give it a second, if not we'll move on to Chains of the Internals. Stephen hi guys, give me a second, I'm just going to share my screen.
00:35:34.070 - 00:35:42.790, Speaker A: Sounds good. All right. Can you see my screen? Yes.
00:35:42.790 - 00:35:53.108, Speaker A: All right. Thanks everyone for welcoming us to the presentation of today's event. I'm going to present to you Chains of the Eternals, a techno fantasy DFI mrpg.
00:35:53.108 - 00:36:11.308, Speaker A: Before we dive in, a bit of an introduction of who the team is. So basically we've been building in DFI since the beginning of 2000 and 22,021 during the bear market. Well, we are all gamers so we thought let's try to build a game that makes sense and right away we saw that we had a problem in the industry that we were facing is that there is no real games in our opinion.
00:36:11.308 - 00:36:31.972, Speaker A: There is pontified Gamified DApps, there is centralized games with tokens. The main purpose is generally to earn or it's a low quality with reused asset game. So we thought about building the first fully on chain, fully decentralized open world MMORPG which is quite a long sentence to describe a game, but basically it consists in six different points.
00:36:31.972 - 00:36:55.276, Speaker A: The first thing is it's an open world MMORPG with dozens of different maps that you can explore with your friends as it's multiplayer which you can fight with your friends and explore the world with your friend. It's completely on chain meaning all the action you're taking are in smart contract, whether it's the quest, the fights and so on. We call it play to own and every item that you earn is in your possession of your character and you can trade them.
00:36:55.276 - 00:37:11.536, Speaker A: We created a balanced game, economic and in game DeFi with DEXes Lending and borrow as well as other DApps directly accessible within the game. A bit more about the tech right now. So we use Unity as the game engine and MetaMask SDK to integrate users'wallet.
00:37:11.536 - 00:37:44.092, Speaker A: We use ECDSA encryption to prevent bot and cheat and we have a custom game editor linked to the database with the game and the smart contract coming up to the chain which was a main issue for us as we had to choose a very scalable EVM for the game content as everything is happening on chain. So we ended up discussing with the Arbitram team and chose Nova for the high scalability, the transaction cost, the fast block time and a lot of bridging solution which pretty much solved all the problems that we foresee. A bit more about the ingame graphics that you can see in our playable demo.
00:37:44.092 - 00:37:58.640, Speaker A: So we have the downtown, we have the Central. Square. We have different dungeons on the top right and we have some alleys connecting map togethers as well as sewers extending below the city, some jungle temple maps and other ghettos area hosting more shady depths.
00:37:58.640 - 00:38:39.390, Speaker A: A couple of different characters that we included in the demo including a necromancer, a healer, a rogue, an engineer and a warrior as well as different NPCs and monsters in the demo with different reference to existing game like Halflife, Super Mario and so on. In terms of the core gameplay we have PvE Fight, PvP Infection Fight Quest and Rewards, a very deep and complex crafting and job economy with Crafter Harvester, a rental economy for your character and a subscription model. And in the world you will find four different elements empowering your character a Pet system, Lenin Properties, ten different character classes and 15 unique zones with different maps around it.
00:38:39.390 - 00:39:05.060, Speaker A: We also added our ingame wallet to allow non crypto and non DeFi user to top up their wallet with ETH, with their credit card right away and without the need to confirm transactions. We have two tokens in the game. The first one is the EXO token which is the main currency of the world and used for every transaction happening in the game whether it's item purchase or usability and the code token which is here to earn the ingame fees.
00:39:05.060 - 00:39:19.884, Speaker A: It's completely deflationary, it's not emitted minted farmed and it's a reserve of value used to vote for different features in the game. Finally, the teams. On the top left we have the DeFi team with Guillaume, Bilal, Alex for the front end web three and back end.
00:39:19.884 - 00:39:34.560, Speaker A: Top right we have Orel, Jeremy, Kantan and Amar which are the art direction, graphic designing and producing. Bottom right, Robin, our advisor from a horizon in Crypto.com and then myself at center lead Solidity and CEO.
00:39:34.560 - 00:39:44.424, Speaker A: Thank you for your time and if you have any questions, happy to answer them. A good presentation. Thank you, Stephen.
00:39:44.424 - 00:39:54.570, Speaker A: Yeah. If you have any questions, feel free to unmute or put in the chat. You know the drill, we'll wait for about 30 seconds, if not, we'll move on to the next team.
00:39:54.570 - 00:40:02.200, Speaker A: Hi Steven, can you hear me? Yes, I can. Yeah. So this is Vincent from Initiate Capital.
00:40:02.200 - 00:40:24.064, Speaker A: You talk about the game will be fully on chain. So which part? Well, the fights aren't chain, the quests aren't chain, your items aren't chain, your character is on chain. So character can possess different items such as loot resources, consumables that are also NFTs exchanges are happening on chain as well.
00:40:24.064 - 00:40:46.084, Speaker A: So the only thing that doesn't happen on chain is the map structure itself and the movement that you do on the maps. But the game content related to your character and your account is on chain. So you mean basically the asset and data and logic is on chain and the presentation layer is not on chain.
00:40:46.084 - 00:40:59.756, Speaker A: Right. The graphics of course is not on chain, but the Unity engine is connected to the Smart contracts with an API, and then you can interact with your different elements on the Smart. Okay.
00:40:59.756 - 00:41:03.630, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Thanks. No problem.
00:41:03.630 - 00:41:14.570, Speaker A: Thank you for the question. I think we have time for one more. I saw a hand earlier, but not sure if it was by mistake.
00:41:14.570 - 00:41:22.136, Speaker A: If no more question, we'll move on to the next team. So. Thank you, Steven.
00:41:22.136 - 00:41:33.780, Speaker A: Thank you. Next team is Nova Chess. I need permission to share the screen.
00:41:33.780 - 00:42:35.630, Speaker A: Could the host please give Sebastian permission to share screen? Hi, Sebastian, can you raise your hand? Yeah, Sebastian, could you raise hand? I think Kevin's having trouble finding you from the crowd. Yeah, and just to reiterate, please rename yourself as Sebastian. That will help our host define who you are and give you a sharing privilege.
00:42:35.630 - 00:42:52.710, Speaker A: And yeah, that applies to everyone on the call from the project side. Cool. Sebastian, you should have sharing.
00:42:52.710 - 00:43:17.260, Speaker A: You can share now. Sebastian, can you hear me? Okay, yeah, I need to restart him, apparently. Give me a second.
00:43:17.260 - 00:43:47.680, Speaker A: Okay, so I don't know how long it takes Sabah to rejoin. I think he's having some connectivity issues, so instead of maybe we'll give him a second, but if not, we'll move on to next team is Mississippi. I think it's Echo.
00:43:47.680 - 00:44:01.556, Speaker A: If you're ready, we can start host, can you please give me the okay. Does it work? Yep. Okay, cool.
00:44:01.556 - 00:44:13.012, Speaker A: Hey guys. I am Echo from Mississippi. We're building a fully on chain game, and I'm happy to present you with our special project built for the hackson, which is a Gamified map generator.
00:44:13.012 - 00:44:32.092, Speaker A: So first of all, I'd like to talk about what kind of new business models or new values could Focgs bring? A straightforward answer would be composability. Yeah, that's true, but how so? One common approach would be to co build with projects, integrate with other games, assets or logic. This is also what Mississippi is doing.
00:44:32.092 - 00:45:00.372, Speaker A: We're trying to integrate with the Lootverse, but this approach has very high entry barrier and is only accessible to professional developers. So we want to present another approach, which is to compute with users, let regular game players contribute to the game, and earn rewards just as easily as DeFi users would deposit their LPs and earn yields. This approach has very low entry barrier and is open to so again, how? And this is our solution.
00:45:00.372 - 00:45:16.200, Speaker A: We want to make a Gamified map generator. So here's a little bit more background information about Mississippi. Mississippi is a PvP roguelike fully on chain game, where users would battle with each other over limited resources within a complicated cave.
00:45:16.200 - 00:45:28.850, Speaker A: So maps would be very crucial for gameplay. A Gamified map generator would allow users to easily create new maps, add comments to the game, and even earn rewards. So let's see how it works.
00:45:28.850 - 00:45:55.796, Speaker A: This is our main interface, where you can see different land formations with their maximum account for example, space with 500 means a player can move up to 500 empty land tiles, then click Go. Now I enter the operating interface where my character is displayed as the red dot at the center of the map. And 25 randomly generated land tiles are faster created around the red dot.
00:45:55.796 - 00:46:17.148, Speaker A: So now I can navigate using my keyboard controls, generating new tiles at each location where I move. And here we have predefined some rules, such as wanting grassland and sea to be connected together. So the chance of generating new sea and grassland tiles around them is increased.
00:46:17.148 - 00:46:32.928, Speaker A: So actually, I can see that most grassland and seas are connected. And now I have used up my 500 space. So the map will automatically close and all the empty land tiles around the map will become walls, thus completing the map.
00:46:32.928 - 00:46:48.980, Speaker A: So now I can click Save, and then the entire map data would be uploaded to the blockchain. And the storage process is built on Mat V two. So now we can check the most recent transaction on this testnet offered by Matt.
00:46:48.980 - 00:47:10.704, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, transaction is already successful, and you'll be able to see a very large array here in input data. This represents the coordinates, the landformations, and every other detail of the map. So, to sum up our technical implementation, the entire map data is stored on blockchain and can be embedded to the game.
00:47:10.704 - 00:47:29.748, Speaker A: And this process is built on Map V two to save gas fees. The creation of the map is temporarily managed on the front end, but we plan to migrate to layer three to make the process gas efficient and verifiable. And regarding our future plans, every generated map will become an NFT owned by player.
00:47:29.748 - 00:47:47.032, Speaker A: Map owners can begin rounds of the game using the generated maps and shared earnings received in each round. Through this approach, we hope to achieve true, decentralization and long term user generated content mechanism. So, yeah, that wraps up our presentation of the map generator.
00:47:47.032 - 00:47:53.264, Speaker A: Thanks for watching and any questions on Webcom. Awesome. Thank you so much.
00:47:53.264 - 00:48:16.230, Speaker A: Echo, any questions from our audience and judges? I think we have longer time for this presentation, but give it a see. I think Sebastian is just back. Perfect.
00:48:16.230 - 00:48:33.500, Speaker A: Let's move on to Nova Chess back. Yes. I think there's a bit of an echo, though.
00:48:33.500 - 00:48:53.334, Speaker A: Yeah. Everyone, please make sure your audio setting, your screen sharing, and all those settings are good before ahead of time, just so we can make sure everything goes I moved at the back of the hall that I'd be good enough. All right, so my name is Sebastian.
00:48:53.334 - 00:49:10.782, Speaker A: I'm one of the founders of Pima Studios. We're the world's largest roll up framework for games in autonomous world. The way Pima engine works is that the user writes a state machine in JavaScript and then Pima converts that state machine into a layer two for EVM chain of your choice.
00:49:10.782 - 00:49:23.090, Speaker A: And then we have SDKs for a few different chains. So, like, different layer twos have different frameworks. For EVM, we add layer two, we still hear a bit of the echoes in the background.
00:49:23.090 - 00:49:32.280, Speaker A: This is Yamu from ARPA. And then I think I still hear some echoes in the background, which makes it super hard for me to understand. Sorry.
00:49:32.280 - 00:49:46.430, Speaker A: Yeah. Nova, would it be possible to adjust the audio settings we can move you to later and just let us know when you're ready, if that's better. Yeah, there's a very strong echo.
00:49:46.430 - 00:49:57.194, Speaker A: I'm going to try walking into a different room. Okay, no worries. Yeah.
00:49:57.194 - 00:50:09.620, Speaker A: Next project we have Metaline X. Let's move on to them first. Let us know when you're ready.
00:50:09.620 - 00:50:35.436, Speaker A: Just let me share my screen. Does this work? Yep. Cool.
00:50:35.436 - 00:50:54.290, Speaker A: So, hi, everyone. This is Dori from Metaline and we are actually building a comprehensive and fully on chain Webster game platform. So, Metal X is actually a rebranded version of Metal line, so we added the letter X in the end.
00:50:54.290 - 00:51:28.340, Speaker A: What really makes Metal X stand out is that we've not only got a bunch of our very own original games, but we are also offering a cool package with game engines to SDKs and more to independent developers. And looking ahead, we are really stuck about getting into layer three to create an even more personalized and expensive gaming world. So this might help you have a better understanding of what we are delivering.
00:51:28.340 - 00:51:53.140, Speaker A: So, for players, we offer a range of original web three fully on chain games designed by our in house team, also by amazing independent developers. And for game developers, we provide a comprehensive suite of incubation services to build a mutually beneficial gaming ecosystem. And we are also introducing the concept of our slot auction.
00:51:53.140 - 00:52:13.260, Speaker A: It's somewhat similar to Polkadot's approach. However, our trust is that we are auctioning the rights for games to join our platform. So users of Metallic X, they can participate by staking the platform tokens to vote for the project Pay auction.
00:52:13.260 - 00:52:37.636, Speaker A: In return, this project will reward users with their own tokens. So, up until now, we have a reserve of more than 20 amazing games waiting to be integrated, including lightweighted H five games and different sort of application games. So, our first ecosystem game, In Align, was introduced on Arbitrum in May this year.
00:52:37.636 - 00:52:58.190, Speaker A: And Metal Line is the first web three pixel style maritime simulation game. And we'll also be introducing a battle system and threatening large scale maritime tournaments with exciting rewards soon. This game is already running and if you guys are interested, just join and have fun there.
00:52:58.190 - 00:53:07.532, Speaker A: And this is some game scenes. You can have a preview. So, this is what we have achieved so far.
00:53:07.532 - 00:53:29.030, Speaker A: The transaction volume of all of the Metal EMTs is around something 1000 Ace. And we have over 100K on chain transactions for the first launch week on Arbitron. And we have 100K Twitter followers and more than 40K discord members.
00:53:29.030 - 00:54:42.800, Speaker A: This is the 30 seconds of the game that's middle line I just played. Just a very quick preview, so yeah, and Line X is definitely more than Line, and we are building a more diverse ecosystem at the moment. And thank you for having me.
00:54:42.800 - 00:54:47.742, Speaker A: That's all. Awesome. Thank you so much.
00:54:47.742 - 00:55:18.514, Speaker A: Zoe, any questions from our judges for Zoe and the Metalon Apps team? We'll wait for a second if no questions. Seba, do you think it's good to go or do you need a little more? Yeah, I think I found, like, a private room at the venue that I can use. So hopefully this is good now.
00:55:18.514 - 00:55:22.900, Speaker A: Perfect. Yep, it's working for me now. Yeah, it's great.
00:55:22.900 - 00:55:28.994, Speaker A: All right, let's try again. So I'm sebastian. I'm one of the co founders of Pima Studios.
00:55:28.994 - 00:55:46.534, Speaker A: We're the world's largest roll up framework optimized for on chain games, Autonomous Worlds. So the way it works is basically you as a user, you create a state machine using JavaScript, and then Climate turns this into an app specific layer two to EVM layer of your choice. And we provide frameworks for some of the common game engines.
00:55:46.534 - 00:55:58.346, Speaker A: So similar to how other ecosystems add new virtual machines to EVM, we add app specific layer two to EVM. We have quite a few existing B, two B partners and games being built. And our goal is to build a modular gaming stack.
00:55:58.346 - 00:56:14.942, Speaker A: So you have, as a developer, the choice of which chain you want to deploy to which NFTs you want to support, which wallets you want to support. We have our own account abstraction layer, and we're also working on DA layer, DK layer, and AI layer support as well. So in practice for this hackathon, we built on chain chess game deployed to the ARP Term Nova ecosystem.
00:56:14.942 - 00:56:30.442, Speaker A: So you can use MetaMask to use the sequencer for layer two, or you can sell sequence. So Pym is a decentralized layer two, so any user can sell sequence and not rely on the sequencer if they want to. And through our account abstraction framework, we also support some other ecosystems as well.
00:56:30.442 - 00:56:43.790, Speaker A: So, demo time. Hopefully everything just works so I can create my lobby and I can select play against AI. And the AI is not an oracle, so it's actually embedded into the state machine, like the chess AI.
00:56:43.790 - 00:57:00.770, Speaker A: So let's approve the transaction and see if everything works. If not, I have a backup video. And while that's waiting, you can see on Arbitram Nova, you can see all the transactions going through for the game.
00:57:00.770 - 00:57:08.230, Speaker A: This is from the sequencer batching position. Smart contract. All right, so we can see our lobby got started so I can place my move.
00:57:08.230 - 00:57:25.878, Speaker A: And then because on chain, you have to sign your move every time, and I'm signing messages that I'm then sending to the sequencer, who then batches the transaction for me. Main feature we want to demo for this game is that we added support for emulated block times. So the problem with Arbitram Nova is that block times are not constant.
00:57:25.878 - 00:57:41.070, Speaker A: They just happen whenever they happen. This is hard for building ongoing games because it means it's hard to build timers. So in Pima, we built, this system allows games to basically emulate a stable tick rate so they can just assume there's a block every 3 seconds and build their game around it.
00:57:41.070 - 00:57:50.290, Speaker A: And under the hood, Pima engine will make it all work. So that's how we built these timers for chess. Even though building this kind of timer on armchair natively is kind of difficult.
00:57:50.290 - 00:57:59.866, Speaker A: And we have documentation that explains the entire tick rate system and how we built this. For Nova. Pymeengine is open source.
00:57:59.866 - 00:58:11.466, Speaker A: You can find all the code on GitHub as well. As the chess game we've deployed is also open source, and you can find it in our game templates repo. We have templates like Chess Trading, Card Games, Unity Web 2.5
00:58:11.466 - 00:58:22.218, Speaker A: Game, and quite a few other templates as well. And yeah, that's the demo. Awesome.
00:58:22.218 - 00:58:43.280, Speaker A: Well, thank you, Seba. Any questions from our judges? I'm glad the presentation worked out perfect. Well, if there's no more additional questions, we'll move on to the next team we have.
00:58:43.280 - 00:59:00.580, Speaker A: Hey there. Could you allow me for screen sharing? Yes, absolutely. Kevin, could you maybe you should be able to now be able to see it.
00:59:00.580 - 00:59:04.662, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool. I'll start then.
00:59:04.662 - 00:59:14.674, Speaker A: Gabby world is a fully AI generated autonomous world of adventures. It all started with a thought experiment. What if we lived in a simulated world? We'll either be in this world voluntarily or involuntarily.
00:59:14.674 - 00:59:26.506, Speaker A: If the former, they'll probably mean that we're uploaded consciousness, but without memory of our decision to be in this world. If the latter, it'll likely mean that we're just AR characters. But either way, there will most likely be a player who place us behind.
00:59:26.506 - 00:59:41.002, Speaker A: And the fact that we're voluntarily in this world will mean that the system is most likely fair or not subject to any manipulation not controlled by the world's creators nor the players. Meaning that the system is likely self governing. So these are the three key Hypotheses that we have.
00:59:41.002 - 00:59:57.302, Speaker A: And of course, there could be another possibility that we are NPCs, but then it'll just make us too insignificant to be further discussed. So if you were to replicate a world as a proxy to the above hypotheses, then there will be three design principles. First, we apply Kyl Jung's model of Psych to explain the player character relationship.
00:59:57.302 - 01:00:09.254, Speaker A: The character has his own free will, so it will be the consciousness. The player guides the character by being his subconsciousness, and all the players together will represent the collective subconsciousness. Second, we need to run the world as autonomous growing concern.
01:00:09.254 - 01:00:19.850, Speaker A: So blockchain will be essential here so that we can run all the world logics on chain. And all logics can be added to the world permissionlessly. And lastly, the world has to govern itself not by the creators nor by the players.
01:00:19.850 - 01:00:29.274, Speaker A: So we need an absolutely fair third party. Only AI can do it. So we dedicate the whole world engine to large language models and all logics will be composable through prompts.
01:00:29.274 - 01:01:12.292, Speaker A: And that's how we arrived at Gabby World and Aigc autonomous world built through on chain prompts. We have three key elements in the world on chain characters, on chain scenarios hello. Welcome everyone.
01:01:12.292 - 01:01:24.504, Speaker A: Like our demo day is going to be online continuously. So if you're interested, feel free to continue to watch online. And I want to give a warm welcome to all the ones that come here today for Seven x.
01:01:24.504 - 01:01:50.364, Speaker A: New chance to meet. And it's of great excitement and anticipation that we are all here today to delve into the frontiers of innovation, explore pressing questions and connect with brilliant minds here. Our agenda for today is packed with insightful sessions featuring keynotes presentation on infrastructure frontier, on modular world, on security and privacy and expert panels on CK, Social, Gaming and DeFi.
01:01:50.364 - 01:02:07.748, Speaker A: And also we have keynote presentations from leading industry researchers and founders in the web free. And also now let's start explore the future of web free and new trends. And before we start, I would like to give special thanks to our sponsors Matrix, Goplus and Dodo.
01:02:07.748 - 01:02:28.280, Speaker A: And also thanks our strategic median partner o Daily and special supporters from HashKey Capital, Bigcraft Figment Capital ABCDE, Metrics Ventures and Dragonfly. Now it's go time. Like before we start, let's first welcome our panel Luis to give us an opening talk on today's event.
01:02:28.280 - 01:03:08.758, Speaker A: Let's welcome it controller. Come on. Hey, morning everyone.
01:03:08.758 - 01:03:17.146, Speaker A: How are you? Yeah, thank you for coming. It's early morning, hope you guys already have a coffee and breakfast. Feel a bit fresh right now.
01:03:17.146 - 01:04:46.208, Speaker A: So we are still waiting for some photo slides. So just like the one to two minutes we can start right now. I think first slides I will basically introduce semX.
01:04:46.208 - 01:05:02.908, Speaker A: So I think so many people ask me this question. Why we call semX is that we are aiming for seven times return or why not ten x or one KX. So that reason why I want to clarify why we call seven x.
01:05:02.908 - 01:05:29.936, Speaker A: It's actually from religious, from eastern and western culture. Seven is a number like in eastern culture when the Buddha walks every seven steps, the lotus flower, blue and also in the western culture and God used seven days to create a world. So seven is a number, is a magic number for both east and western culture.
01:05:29.936 - 01:05:56.040, Speaker A: And x means infinity. So with the seven x we really want to bridge different cultures, no matter your builders from Asia, from Europe, US or Africa or all the world trying to empower the blockchain together. And also because blockchain is actually without any kind of geographic and culture barrier.
01:05:56.040 - 01:06:17.950, Speaker A: So that reason why we want to call Semex to unify everyone in the world to push the boundary of the blockchain. So that's the reason why we call Semex. Yeah.
01:06:17.950 - 01:06:39.506, Speaker A: And also, what I really want to highlight for semX Ventures right now is like so we are research driven crypto venture. So there are so many kinds of venture capital in the world from more than 100 how to make the seven X differentiate from others. So I think in three areas.
01:06:39.506 - 01:07:13.386, Speaker A: The first thing, we are working with all the top researchers in the world, including researchers from EF, from flashballs, from eggon layer and from others. So we want to basically have the regular base touch with them to understand the latest innovations in the industry and also consolidate all the innovations and publish article and threads to show to everyone what happened in the crypto world. The second lay is we always follow the frontier innovations you can see from twitter threads and twitter articles.
01:07:13.386 - 01:07:37.474, Speaker A: We are the first several ways in the world to publish the article about Zak machine learning and also we are also the first several investors to publish article about intent like Grace wrote article about decoding the intent. So we have more and more like the latest research we are coming out in next one to two months. What we really believe that crypto is about innovation.
01:07:37.474 - 01:07:57.630, Speaker A: We follow the latest innovations in the crypto world. Then the thirdly I think for a lot of people they have this impression to waste investors are transactional when the investor talk to you, they just want to give you money, get a financial return from you guys. So our approach is very different.
01:07:57.630 - 01:08:42.378, Speaker A: We want to build a long term research collaboration with project first I'm trying to work with founders, work with researchers, help them to consolidate all their ideas, generate articles about their products, their technology and showing on the Twitter, showing to everyone in the crypto space what they are doing. By building this long term research collaboration, we actually can helping them to give them the support to share their innovation, their product, their technology to the different people. So with all that like when we build a long term relationship then we're talking about investment opportunity so that's how we approach different from other ways.
01:08:42.378 - 01:09:06.530, Speaker A: That reason why when semX approaches builders, what we really want to approach builders, to say let's do the research together. Let's to understand your technology, your product, first, before making any investment. So and thirdly, because we had a research focus, we are working with the top researchers and builders in the world.
01:09:06.530 - 01:09:29.494, Speaker A: And also we also want to empower the more and more builders. So what we do is we are really here for builders, we have this Nitro hackstone for fully on chain gaming and we also have Intent based hiker house during the SBC. So with Nitro brand we will have more like hike zone and hiker house in different conference.
01:09:29.494 - 01:09:56.882, Speaker A: If for all the builders. When you have the idea about whether you want to create a great product, whether you want to build your own company. We can connect you with the top researchers in the world from the flashboard, from EF, from other projects trying to give you the guidance whether your idea makes sense and also the giga brings in the industry to help you to build your own startups.
01:09:56.882 - 01:10:31.130, Speaker A: So that's reason why we want to create a research and Builder focus fund. That's what the program we offer the builders and with our and all likes our research and builder focus in terms of investment we are actually investor for the top notch projects in the industry including Flashboss, Skirl, Menta, Caldera and Deepbank and other guys. We'll also power the most promising early stage startups in the industry.
01:10:31.130 - 01:10:57.778, Speaker A: So with all this we want to basically invest in the frontier technology in the blockchain space and to work together with all the researchers, builders and VC to push the boundary of the blockchain and to make sure that the blockchain is for the future and to onboard more users in the blockchain space. So that's a brief introduction of Zemex. Thank you so much for listening.
01:10:57.778 - 01:11:18.670, Speaker A: I hope you enjoy the other talks in the industry in the conference. And next we are waiting for our first research talk. I'm so excited to hear about the innovations in DA layer so I'll pass my mic to Grace.
01:11:18.670 - 01:11:29.066, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks Luis, for the amazing opening. Yeah.
01:11:29.066 - 01:11:42.040, Speaker A: And now let's delve into the exciting frontiers at the DA layer. So we are honored to have Prabha, the founder of Avail, to give our first talk today. And now let's have a warm welcome.
01:11:42.040 - 01:12:12.710, Speaker A: Hi everyone as we are still waiting for the presentation to come up. Thanks for coming so early and sitting here to listen to this talk. I'm Prabhal, I am one of the co founders of Avail.
01:12:12.710 - 01:12:41.192, Speaker A: And as the content comes up, let me just introduce myself a bit and what Avail does and how it all started. So we started Avail within Polygon in 2021 and I joined there as a researcher and became one of the lead researchers there in Polygon. And we built this for around two years before spinning it out of Polygon into a separate entity.
01:12:41.192 - 01:13:23.004, Speaker A: So we now have Avail as an independent, credibility neutral kind of DA Layer, right? So the main agenda of this talk today is that we want to go through because there's a new trends summit, we want to go through some of the new trends that we are seeing in Blockchain and of course talk about Avail and how that enables some of these newer trends that we are seeing. So one of the main trends, and this needs no introduction really is how we are seeing a recent trends in roll ups. And you must have noticed that ethereum based roll ups have taken the center stage today.
01:13:23.004 - 01:14:03.620, Speaker A: Almost all the activity that happens like around four x of the activity of Ethereum happens on roll ups today, right? And they have taken the center stage because we have realized that Ethereum cannot scale. Computational scaling is not possible from within the Ethereum and that's why we are creating roll ups to help scale and take execution off chain while proving transactions on chain. Now, one of the main ways to see roll ups as implemented on Ethereum is that of a validating bridge, which means that the transactions that are submitted to Ethereum are submitted to this bridge.
01:14:03.620 - 01:14:19.660, Speaker A: The execution is taken off chain. They are done in a provable manner, either in optimistic manner where it is secured by fraud proofs or using validity proofs in the ZK rollups. And then finally these assets are then bridged back onto Ethereum.
01:14:19.660 - 01:15:08.590, Speaker A: And as this trend moves forward, we have seen that blockchain constructions are inherently becoming modular, right? And we know that the modular word is being thrown around quite a lot in different contexts, sometimes abused the terms as many of these terms in this ecosystem. But what it means to be modular in this context is how the functionality of blockchains are being broken into specialized layers, right? So previously it was a monolithic chain where all the constructions like the settlement, the data availability and the execution were all done in a single layer. Now, what we do is we take these layers and try to separate them out into specific layers, thus enabling each one of them to do better in their own terms.
01:15:08.590 - 01:15:41.530, Speaker A: The roll ups, they only scale the executional part and we are here to scale the data availability part, right? While Ethereum remains one of the settlement layers of the world. Now, what do we need for these roll ups to thrive? All of these roll ups are hungry for data. If you ask any of the leading DA or the roll up experts they would tell you that 70% to 90% of the costs that users pay on roll ups are because of data availability charges today.
01:15:41.530 - 01:15:54.940, Speaker A: And that's where we come in. We give this bold statement and a new trend which we say that every base layer is going to be a DA layer. That is one of the hypothesis that we have.
01:15:54.940 - 01:16:06.480, Speaker A: And this is where avail comes. So what is avail? Right? So it's a modular base layer. It provides only raw block space to modular chains on top.
01:16:06.480 - 01:16:30.250, Speaker A: So it does something called sequencing, which is some of the things that you can use a base DA layer for. For example, in Arbitrum, if you want to force transactions, you can send the transaction directly to Ethereum. So then Ethereum acts as your ordering layer, although you can send a transaction directly to its sequencer at which point the sequencing happens at Arbitram sequencer level.
01:16:30.250 - 01:16:42.948, Speaker A: So the DA can provide sequencing. It also packages the data in a manner in which it is provably available and it then. Publishes this data.
01:16:42.948 - 01:17:02.684, Speaker A: So it segregates all the transactional data on a per application basis so that multiple of these applications can send their transactions within the same block of a DA layer. So in avail, we have a robust validator set that sign off these published blocks. But they do not execute transactions.
01:17:02.684 - 01:17:13.360, Speaker A: They do not interpret transactions to avail. All the transactions are basically data blobs. And each roll up built on top act as the interpretation layer.
01:17:13.360 - 01:17:30.168, Speaker A: They act as the execution layer who take these transactions, interpret them. And it can be anything we don't want to be for a particular execution engine. It can be Ethereum virtual machine, a Solana virtual machine, a customized ZK VM, and so on.
01:17:30.168 - 01:18:08.980, Speaker A: And that is where innovations will thrive, right, with new VMs and application environments coming in. Now, one of the main features that we have, and a main differentiating factor considering other chains that are there, we have a light client which leverages KZG polynomial commitments, erasure coding and data availability sampling to create a verification that the data is available without downloading the entire block. And that is one of the superpowers of DA layers, right? You do not need to download all the data to know that, whether it is available or not.
01:18:08.980 - 01:18:26.856, Speaker A: And that is one of the classic differences to what Ethereum offers today. Now, this allows a massive and vibrant ecosystem to be built on top because different types of roll ups can come in, they can adapt to their unique needs. We can create something like validiums.
01:18:26.856 - 01:18:30.204, Speaker A: We can create l three s. L four s. Whatever.
01:18:30.204 - 01:18:59.368, Speaker A: There can be state validating bridges amongst the particular roll ups that are sitting on top of the same DA layer like avail, and they can now share security. So Bridging becomes the strongest type of Bridging, which is not something like a liquidity bridge or light client based bridge, but it's a state verifying bridge, one of the strongest types of bridges that can happen. And hence the applications do not need to bootstrap their own validator set.
01:18:59.368 - 01:19:18.236, Speaker A: They can come in, use the security of avail, and then build applications on top. Now, coming to the again, I won't go through in too much detail, but essentially speaking, the avail block proposal engine works as follows. You take the original data, you do erasure coding on top.
01:19:18.236 - 01:19:32.992, Speaker A: This is to create redundancy in the data so that it's very hard for a block proposer to hide parts of the data. And that is extremely important in a DA sense. And this is one of the core differences from data storage, right? So sometimes people confuse that.
01:19:32.992 - 01:19:48.400, Speaker A: Why don't you just keep the data in something like Filecoin or RV or something like that? The key difference is that you do not trust the block publisher. So all the roll up block publishers can try to hide data. And that's why you create redundancy.
01:19:48.400 - 01:20:07.612, Speaker A: By creating redundancy, you then commit to that redundant amount of information inside the header. This header is validated across the board by all the validators and then the block gets published. In terms of block production, every application sends uniquely to a particular app ID.
01:20:07.612 - 01:20:28.064, Speaker A: The data blobs are chunked and a so called matrix is populated. Because we need a 2D encoding structure, we generate the commitments row wise. One of the key properties of how we are able to do this so efficiently is because there is a homophobic property of KZG polynomial commitments, sorry.
01:20:28.064 - 01:20:43.064, Speaker A: And that allows us to not have to erasure code. It code the data all the time, but just erasure code the commitments. I will tell you just what that means and the matrix can be adjusted to demand and that is one of the other superpowers of avail.
01:20:43.064 - 01:20:57.310, Speaker A: And then the header contains the commitments, application index and so on and so forth. So this is what I meant by the matrix structure. Each of these cells here are basically scalar fields of the BLST 381 field.
01:20:57.310 - 01:21:19.190, Speaker A: They are taken together to create commitments row wise. These commitments can be erasure coded. The homophobic property allows you to just compute C one to CN erasure code C one to CN to produce C n plus one to two n and then you actually know without having to extend all the column data by themselves.
01:21:19.190 - 01:21:44.524, Speaker A: In the base layer stack. There are some key trends that I want to highlight, just not going through what just avail does, right? One of the key things to understand here in terms of block production is that there is a verifiability finality dilemma in consensus systems. In blockchains what that means is you cannot have finality guarantees and liveness guarantees at the same time.
01:21:44.524 - 01:22:14.912, Speaker A: And that is why we use two engines, much like how Ethereum changed post merge, right? Post merge you have finality delayed and liveness always coming in front. So we have a Babe grandpa kind of a consensus where Babe is the block production engine which is VRF based block leader selection implemented. Inside there is grandpa which acts as a finalty gadget, which doesn't finalize just individual blocks, block by block, but finalizes entire chains.
01:22:14.912 - 01:22:31.956, Speaker A: And this is tolerant against network partitions and nodes going down, multiple nodes going down. And that comes with the resiliency of the blockchain system. You must have seen in the recent past things like Ethereum the finality got stuck, but liveness continued.
01:22:31.956 - 01:23:01.248, Speaker A: And that is one of the very good things to happen in blockchains where it doesn't matter if a few nodes are down or the clients do not agree within themselves, but the blockchain must go on. The other thing I want to talk about is how nominated proof of stake kind of is a bit of a different from delegated proof of stake and how delegated proof of stake leads to stake centralization. So we must have seen that most networks where they use a DPOs, there is a large stake.
01:23:01.248 - 01:23:14.264, Speaker A: And that large stake is with the expectation for a large power which in turn gives them large rewards. And this leads to a cycle which leads to more and more stake centralization. We want to avoid that.
01:23:14.264 - 01:23:38.796, Speaker A: And that's why we choose nominated proof of stake where we use fragment elections to have something like a proportional justified representation of validators before choosing them into the active validator set. And that is one of the more reasons why we can use something like say 1000 validators in the active set and not like in a waiting list somewhere. The other thing is about light client networks.
01:23:38.796 - 01:24:16.300, Speaker A: So the light clients, what they do is they sample parts of the data. This light client network creates a peer to peer to peer overlay network on top of the base layer and that allows them to sample and keep small chunks of the data, which together keeps the replica of the block in a redundant manner. And what that means is, even if a validator goes rogue or supermajority of the validators, just think about it, supermajority of a blockchain network wants to suppress parts of the data, you should still be able to be able to know whether the data is available or not.
01:24:16.300 - 01:24:50.648, Speaker A: And that is a big guarantee and that is a trend shift that we want to see in this community, right? So what that means is the light clients maintain a DHT of the samples and the cell level proofs are kept. Anyone can join the network, sample it, verify and then assert by themselves whether the data is available or not and not rely on some other network. And the key points to highlight here is that there is no need to trust the validator set for the availability of data.
01:24:50.648 - 01:25:12.140, Speaker A: Even if the supermajority of avail validators want to suppress, you will be able to catch it by using a small amount of samples. Once enough light clients have sampled, the data remains available on the DHT. Think of it like a file, once downloaded, can be uploaded to a torrent network and stays available there even if the server goes down.
01:25:12.140 - 01:25:37.168, Speaker A: Think of that as a good mental model. There is no need to rely on centralized RPC providers. That is another trend shift that we want to see in blockchains where we do not rely on RPC providers for verifiable data, we actually download and verify it ourselves and then wallets can verify both execution and data availability, correctness, without relying on crypto economic guarantees.
01:25:37.168 - 01:26:25.670, Speaker A: One of the things which is thrown around a lot is the word security, right? And sometimes hidden under the carpet is kind of what do we mean by security? Because most of the security that we get from existing blockchain systems today is crypto economic, right? So this is one of the things where we want to see a change where the security is not just crypto economic, but cryptographic and crypto economic and one of the other things that people talk about a lot is how KZG is inefficient and how it cannot scale and things like that. We have tested this with very high block sizes, something like say 128 MB. And you can see that this is well within our block times and block verification is still extremely fast.
01:26:25.670 - 01:27:09.140, Speaker A: This is without any GPU optimizations and so on. Now, what are the things that will be built on top? This is good that there is a base layer with such properties, but how do people use it? So the things that can be built on top are things like sovereign roll ups, validiums optimistic chains, app specific chains, something like general purpose chains, the L three S, L four S, whatever, right? And what does it mean to have a validium? In this sense, a roll up today can delegate its DA not to Ethereum, but to an off chain DA layer like avail. And then the avail attestation Bridge provides an attestation on ethereum that the data is actually available.
01:27:09.140 - 01:27:35.352, Speaker A: So then the L two only needs to give fraud proofs or validity proofs into ethereum and not give the entire data that it does. So in this way, the most costly affair, which is 70% to 90% as I described, can be offloaded to another layer because it takes around one $300 per MB of data to be published on ethereum today. And similarly for healthy constructions.
01:27:35.352 - 01:28:11.428, Speaker A: Also, in terms of sovereign roll ups, I think one of the things that we see today, but that is being questioned and that is a good thing that most roll ups are implemented as like a contract on L One, which verifies the execution proofs. But with that comes like either it's hard to upgrade or there is a multisig protecting it, there is inability to fork it out unless the L one forks it and so on and so forth. We want to have sovereign roll ups that do verification instead on the light clients, on the user wallets, on the user level.
01:28:11.428 - 01:28:28.350, Speaker A: And that is why social consensus can be just upgrading your nodes and so on. And this opens up a space for a lot of different things. You can have ope stacks, ZK stacks, you can have base sequencers, sequencers, provers, decentralized, centralized, whatever.
01:28:28.350 - 01:28:47.020, Speaker A: In terms of where we are at, I think we are right now running our second long running testnet called the Carte testnet. We have around 100 external validators running as of today. By the end of something like next month we will have around 5000 plus light clients, hopefully.
01:28:47.020 - 01:29:10.072, Speaker A: And around one of the upgrades that we are doing right now is that there will be a two x improvement in commitment generation and much more in terms of verification. We want to launch an incentivized testnet next quarter and hopefully by the end of the year or early next year we will have a main net. There are many, many future optimizations that I don't want to go into in the interest of time.
01:29:10.072 - 01:29:24.252, Speaker A: There are KZG multi proofs where we can optimize commitments. There are Snark based light client bridges that we are working on. We want to change how the validators confirm and produce blocks today.
01:29:24.252 - 01:29:40.160, Speaker A: We want to do much more in the mempool level and so on and so forth. I think one of the key takeaways from this talk should be that because this is a new trend summit and we should of course talk about some of the new trends that are happening in this space. The blockchains are going modular.
01:29:40.160 - 01:29:53.684, Speaker A: Avail creates a fundamental base layer for this ecosystem. The community is right now building lots of different specialized solutions to tackle problems across the stack. We are trying to do better at the base layer.
01:29:53.684 - 01:30:04.904, Speaker A: We want to avoid some of the dilemmas, some of the core problems inside consensus systems. We also want to have better stake distribution and so on. We want to give DA guarantees.
01:30:04.904 - 01:30:19.468, Speaker A: But keep in mind, even if a whale goes down, it should not be a problem. Database sampling is a superpower about how to scale blocks and verify locally. We want to avoid dependence on centralized gateways.
01:30:19.468 - 01:30:27.712, Speaker A: And KZG is not the bottleneck. There is much better ways to scale. Here is our project details.
01:30:27.712 - 01:30:35.270, Speaker A: If you want to take a look at it, feel free to reach out and let's have a chat afterwards. That's it. Thank you.
01:30:35.270 - 01:30:55.116, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks prabha for the amazing introduction of about. And if you're looking for a job, try to do the avail. And also next up, we have two amazing speakers, two founders from Oboe to introduce us the DVT and its impact on the Staking system.
01:30:55.116 - 01:31:09.330, Speaker A: Let's welcome. Okay. Hello everybody.
01:31:09.330 - 01:31:14.604, Speaker A: Hey GMGM. Nice to meet you all. My name is Ashin.
01:31:14.604 - 01:31:27.156, Speaker A: I'm CTO and co founder at Oba Labs. And my name is Richard, head of Business. And today we're going to be talking about our personal favorite topic, which is distributed validator technology.
01:31:27.156 - 01:31:43.896, Speaker A: So, quick show of hands. Who here has actually heard of distributed validator technology? Okay, a few. And who thinks that they would be able to actually describe it in one to two sentences? Concisely jim my guy.
01:31:43.896 - 01:32:11.620, Speaker A: All right, we got a lot of education to do, but it's going to be fun. So today we're going to be talking about the viability of a super robust Ethereum and how DVT actually plays into that idea of a robust world computer. So who is Obelabs? Obelabs is the R and D team that is focused on building technologies for Credibly, neutral trust, minimized infrastructure for Web Three, and specifically today Ethereum.
01:32:11.620 - 01:32:26.824, Speaker A: We are the first core development team. But the idea is that in the future we will actually have multiple developer teams building multiple implementations of oval distributed validator technology. And we are supported by the best.
01:32:26.824 - 01:33:00.468, Speaker A: We're very lucky to have had a massive ecosystem of big players, strong capital providers in the space, as well as some of the most prominent, validators and node operators in the ethereum ecosystem that are very focused on supporting the Oval Team towards building the optimal implementation of DVT. And furthermore, also helping us drive its adoption for the betterment of the entire ethereum ecosystem. And also just really quickly wanted to thank the seven X team for having us here and we're also very excited to be bringing them on as investors as well.
01:33:00.468 - 01:33:36.792, Speaker A: So thanks guys. So what makes for a solid foundation of ethereum? Where are we at today? And what characteristics do we really want to see further accentuated to make ethereum the global settlement layer that we know it can be? So first and foremost, we want extremely high percentage of ethereum staked to the beacon chain in order to increase economic security, right? That's all proof of stake consensus really is at the end of the day, economic based security. The more economics that are staked at the consensus layer, the more robust the security.
01:33:36.792 - 01:33:56.180, Speaker A: Pretty straightforward. Secondly, we want it to be trustworthy, right? So what does that mean? Everything works, blocks are built, blocks are finalized, continue to finalize over time, resilient against any sort of attack vectors at the consensus layer. So it needs to be reliable and trustworthy.
01:33:56.180 - 01:34:19.912, Speaker A: Next, it needs to be inclusive, right? So if this really is the global settlement layer that we know it can be, we want it to be highly participatory from a wide array of participants that are distributed all over the world. But it's actually not just about a GeoDistribution. It's also the type of actors that we want involved in securing this global settlement layer.
01:34:19.912 - 01:34:42.020, Speaker A: So that means it's not just large validator entities, it's also small validator entities. It's really any sort of organizations around the world, big and small. But really more importantly, it's actually about individuals from all over the world empowered to participate in that global settlement layer and securing ethereum.
01:34:42.020 - 01:35:16.120, Speaker A: So, how are we doing so far? What is the state of this global settlement layer that we call ethereum today? At this point in time, stake participation has grown significantly and we are very excited about that. I think before withdrawals it was maybe 1213 percent and now we're actually at more than 20% of the total supply of ethereum staked to the beacon chain. So we're growing very quickly and we anticipate that number to only continue growing, but it's actually not enough.
01:35:16.120 - 01:35:41.452, Speaker A: We would like that number to be significantly higher just because, again, if you think about proof of stake as economic based consensus, that number needs to be higher to secure that global sentiment layer. But we're doing a good job so far and anticipate us to continue doing a good job now into the future. However, solo participation, solo staker participation, specifically people that are running machines at home, grossly underrepresented in this distributed economy.
01:35:41.452 - 01:36:00.664, Speaker A: We estimate that anywhere between six to 8% of validators are controlled by at home stakers per rated at six and a half percent. But those numbers are very hard to get concretely so anywhere between six to 8%. The vast majority of these validators are also based in Europe and in the United States.
01:36:00.664 - 01:36:18.972, Speaker A: That needs to be more distributed in order for ethereum to really manifest its destiny as a global settlement layer. And we've seen recently a couple months ago that the ethereum network was actually having difficulty finalizing blocks. It was still producing blocks, no problem, but finality was called into question.
01:36:18.972 - 01:36:33.756, Speaker A: So again, referring to that resilience that's so required to make ethereum really this global settlement layer. So where does oval and our DVT implementation fit into that picture? I'll kick it over to yoshi. Sweet.
01:36:33.756 - 01:36:53.588, Speaker A: Thank you very much Richard. So as we alluded to, this talk is about new trends in staking, well, new trends in crypto more broadly and we want to talk a bit about Distributed Validators. So for those of you that aren't familiar with what a Distributed Validator is, a Distributed Validator is an ethereum validator that runs on multiple machines with software based fault tolerance.
01:36:53.588 - 01:37:17.680, Speaker A: Think of it like a multi SIG. But for a validator where you only need three of the four nodes to be online and working correctly for your validator to stay online, this is a super powerful piece of software and it's something that we think will change staking for the better for lots of different parties all over ethereum. To give you an idea as to the different types of actors that can benefit from Distributed Validators, I want to talk through them now.
01:37:17.680 - 01:37:34.608, Speaker A: So the first one are the staking products, these are the liquid staking protocols and the likes. These people gather up a lot of ether and want to stake it with node operators. But these node operators at the moment have kind of total control over certain amounts of these stake.
01:37:34.608 - 01:38:01.532, Speaker A: Certain entities in Lido have about a half a billion dollars or more of stake that they're responsible for. What a liquid staking protocol would prefer to do would be to have that stake being shared by a group of entities rather than one single entity having total control over it. This reduces the risk of slashing, it reduces the risk of them going offline and generally makes the liquid staking protocols more resilient to bad actors on the professional operator front.
01:38:01.532 - 01:38:25.956, Speaker A: So the centralized node operators that run stake for enterprise clients, these people can also benefit from Distributed Validators but don't necessarily use it for the idea of multi operator validation. For professional operator you use a Distributed Validator for high uptime. You can put your validator across multiple machines, generally lower cost, more performant bare metal ones than something that runs in the cloud.
01:38:25.956 - 01:38:43.800, Speaker A: And when machines die, which happens all of the time, no big deal, your validator stays online, you fix the broken machine during working hours and everything runs smoothly and you have no downtime. This is something that is a very common technology in web Two. Google doesn't go offline when they update their version or a machine dies.
01:38:43.800 - 01:39:02.540, Speaker A: Neither should Ethereum Validators on the home staking front. Home stakers are obviously very keen to get involved in Ethereum staking, but 32 Ether is now prohibitively high for almost every home staker. And with distributed validators you can enable the idea of squad staking.
01:39:02.540 - 01:39:25.272, Speaker A: Squad Staking is the idea that you can team up with other people around the world, share your ether and stake together in a group. This again brings all the same benefits of resiliency, trust, minimization and allows a home staker to have the uptime performance that a professional enterprise might have currently. And last but not least, one of the real benefactors of Distributed Validators is the Ethereum network itself.
01:39:25.272 - 01:39:46.044, Speaker A: If the Ethereum network has more parties that are validating as groups rather than individuals, these people are like validating from multiple geographies, multiple jurisdictions. This all adds together to make validators more resilient, more immutable and less likely to harm the network. That's kind of some of the main upsides of Distributed Validators.
01:39:46.044 - 01:40:06.416, Speaker A: So if they're all the upsides, where are Distributed Validators on their journey at the moment? Distributed Validators as a concept have been around since 2019 in DevCon when they were first presented by the Ethereum Foundation. And at this point in time we're running on main net. Since the end of last year we have 40 node operators running a production.
01:40:06.416 - 01:40:35.084, Speaker A: At this point in our alpha phase we're working on a main Net MVP with Lido to bring Distributed Validators into Lido, hopefully early in the new year. We've been doing large scale test nets with our community, including having 1600 girly validators running DVS with operators from all over the world. We have solo stakers actually running main net Validators and liquid staking protocols with Etherfi as of a month or two ago.
01:40:35.084 - 01:41:10.008, Speaker A: This is growing quite rapidly and it's great to see that we can get these solo stakers that wouldn't be able to run or wouldn't have the capital requirements to do so, to be able to get involved and to decentralize these liquid staking protocols and to make them more resilient. On the performance testing side, we recently did a performance test with the MIGA Labs team out of the Barcelona Supercomputer Center. They ran 3000 girly validators on four bare metal machines proving that you can have high uptime resilience and extremely low cost versus kind of cloud based deployments that current enterprises use.
01:41:10.008 - 01:41:31.232, Speaker A: And last but not least, we've also completed a security assessment with Sigma Prime early in the year and we're doing a lot of ongoing work on auditing and penetration testing. Our solidity, our front end, our client and all of those good things. To talk a little bit about how these Distributed Validators actually work, I want to kind of dig into the technicals a little.
01:41:31.232 - 01:42:02.368, Speaker A: So BLS signatures do something interesting that hasn't really been done before, which is you can add signatures together without access to the private keys. What's important about this is it allows Distributed Validators to be a simple middleware that sits between a validator client and its consensus client. And it does two things it comes to consensus on what every Validator will sign, and once every validator signs the exact same thing and returns the signature, these middlewares aggregate the signature into like a group signature and send it upwards to the network.
01:42:02.368 - 01:42:20.716, Speaker A: What's nice about this is the client doesn't need anyone to change the private key infrastructure. They can keep their existing stack and they just add in one simple middleware that works like a little proxy and that allows them to gain the benefits of Distributed Validators. Another important aspect of it is the Distributed Key generation.
01:42:20.716 - 01:42:36.208, Speaker A: At the moment, with the centralized Validator, one entity, and often a couple humans in that company have access to all of the private keys. And if they click on a Dodgy PDF or something of the sort, even metallic can get hacked. Somebody can get access to all of the private keys.
01:42:36.208 - 01:42:56.412, Speaker A: For a Validator, that is an extremely scary situation, especially at scale, because slashing scales nonlinearly. The mitigation for that is to do a Distributed key generation rather than to create the keys separately. Centrally, that means that all of the entities running the Distributed Validator have a piece of the key, but no one entity has all of it.
01:42:56.412 - 01:43:10.464, Speaker A: So you have to compromise many, many people to get the full private key to be able to slash them. The last thing I will say is that these Distributed Validators use consensus. So you generally need more than two thirds of nodes to be online and honest.
01:43:10.464 - 01:43:17.568, Speaker A: That means in a four node cluster you can have one offline. In a seven node cluster you can have two offline. In a ten node cluster you can have three offline.
01:43:17.568 - 01:43:38.584, Speaker A: And despite that, they'll all stay up and online and healthy in a testing. So why should you care? Is this important or not? Is this a new trend? Vitalik has had Distributed Validators on his roadmap for Ethereum since about 2020 and it's one of the remaining items on the merge section. And if Vitalik cares, I think you should care too.
01:43:38.584 - 01:43:50.750, Speaker A: To be perfectly honest. And as I alluded to before, ethereum will be more decentralized and more resilient if people stake as groups rather than individuals. And that's kind of what I'm here to convince you today of.
01:43:50.750 - 01:44:06.348, Speaker A: Last but not least, how might you get involved in this if your interest has been piqued? We have a discord community. We would encourage you to run a Distributed Validator on Gurley or on Mainnet. If you're feeling brave, please get in touch with us if you'd like to get involved.
01:44:06.348 - 01:44:19.920, Speaker A: The QR code here is a link to our link tree which has links to our discord, to our launchpad, our Doc site, and most importantly, we're hiring. We're hiring golang. Researchers, community organizers.
01:44:19.920 - 01:44:34.156, Speaker A: We have quite a number of open roles. So if you're in the space and you like the idea of working to decentralize Ethereum, I'd highly recommend you throw in an application and have a chat with our team. Other than that, thank you very much for listening and I think that's about it.
01:44:34.156 - 01:44:43.152, Speaker A: I don't think there's questions today. See you guys. Yeah.
01:44:43.152 - 01:44:50.652, Speaker A: Thanks, Max. And Colin. Yeah, I can't wait to witness DVT and Oboe to take off in the near term.
01:44:50.652 - 01:45:03.248, Speaker A: And next up, we have Max from SMG. Like, Max is one of the best researchers I know in the Mev realm, so I can't wait to hear Max talk about his latest research about proposals rant in Sachs desk. Arbitrage.
01:45:03.248 - 01:45:25.710, Speaker A: So let's welcome thanks for having me here, Grace. And thanks for guys listening to me drone on about mev. This is really going to be a talk about how the sausage is made, how blocks are made.
01:45:25.710 - 01:45:44.320, Speaker A: So we all know that every 12 seconds there's a new block, but what actually goes into it and how do we construct it. So the first thing is, blocks don't automatically just build themselves. The transactions don't just fall down a gravity well and make their way into a well ordered block.
01:45:44.320 - 01:45:52.256, Speaker A: They have to be built by somebody, but validators don't want to do it. Why? Because they're not good at it. They're not good at building blocks.
01:45:52.256 - 01:46:02.712, Speaker A: They're not good at extracting value. If you think about this system, building a block is actually pretty valuable. You get to put whichever transactions you want first, you get to put transactions last.
01:46:02.712 - 01:46:07.224, Speaker A: You get to include transactions. You get to keep them out. That's a lot of power.
01:46:07.224 - 01:46:36.176, Speaker A: If you went to somebody on the street and you said, hey, would you like to order the New York Stock Exchange for 12 seconds, which is the Ethereum block time? They might be like, yes, and then they would realize that they don't really know enough to actually use that. So it's a really powerful thing, but you really have to have some knowledge and some other resources in order to do that well. So if you continue with this thought experiment, the guy that you just came up to and said, would you like to order the New York Stock Exchange? Says yes.
01:46:36.176 - 01:46:56.570, Speaker A: And then he goes around and sells it to Citadel, and Citadel makes a lot of money off it. So that's exactly what happens on Chain. Right now we have an auction called the PBS Auction, or Mev Boost, which is just this first price English auction that happens every 12 seconds in 95% of blocks on Ethereum, which auctions off the right to build it.
01:46:56.570 - 01:47:10.632, Speaker A: But the problem is that within 12 seconds, which is actually a relatively long time in terms of finance, prices can move a. Lot. So here I have a real time GIF of prices for a single block.
01:47:10.632 - 01:47:38.220, Speaker A: And on the right, you can see bids coming in. And as you can see, the price moves about $40, which is almost over 1%. And what that does is now the right to build a block becomes super valuable because the first few slots in the block are going to be able to capture arbitrage between uniswap and the other on chain exchanges and finance, so they can make a lot of money if they win the block.
01:47:38.220 - 01:47:59.980, Speaker A: And, of course, what do you know, we look at the block and the first 36 transactions of the block are arbitrage transactions. This is not uncommon. These bots are very active, they trade in a lot of blocks and they're much more likely to trade when the blocks are more volatile.
01:47:59.980 - 01:48:14.304, Speaker A: So let's just take a look at the first transaction. The bot that was also the party that won this block, they placed their own bots transaction first. And you can see they traded in massive size, $4.3
01:48:14.304 - 01:48:26.004, Speaker A: million worth of ETH bought. So if we go back to the slide, you can remember that the price went up. So it makes sense to buy ETH at a $40 discount, basically.
01:48:26.004 - 01:48:51.180, Speaker A: So they made quite a bit of money on this trade. And you can see, based on their builder payment, they paid 15 ETH to the builder, but that's kind of a transfer to themselves. So one of the things we're going to be interested in in this talk is, does that make sense as the actual value that they made from that transaction? And I will argue that that's a pretty reasonable value.
01:48:51.180 - 01:49:05.010, Speaker A: And so they paid themselves about 15 ETH, which means this was worth about 15 ETH, basically, and they paid about 16 ETH for the block. So this was just the first of 36 transactions. So you can imagine they're making quite a bit of money here.
01:49:05.010 - 01:49:22.188, Speaker A: But there's another person who also likes to make a lot of money and that's the proposer. Going back to our example of the guy on the street who's selling it, he's selling it to the highest bidder. And so Citadel might be biding on the right to order the New York Stock Exchange, and Jump might be biding on the right to order the New York Stock Exchange.
01:49:22.188 - 01:49:55.276, Speaker A: And so they are competing against each other and driving all these rents to the proposer, who really does control the ordering, but it's just auctioning it off to the highest bidder. And the question is whether the proposer really is getting the lion's share of the profits or whether this auction is not really competitive enough to drive those profits to the proposer. So there was another piece that kind of inspired me to work on this by Frontier Research that tried to answer this question and they tried to ask, what is the share of these sextex profits that actually go to the proposer.
01:49:55.276 - 01:50:17.716, Speaker A: So the number that they came up with was 33% to 77% which as far as I'm concerned they might have said 2% to 99% because that's a way too high confidence interval for me as a researcher. But I kind of wanted to understand what they were doing so I went and asked them. It turns out this was some joint work between Frontier Research and Jump.
01:50:17.716 - 01:50:43.628, Speaker A: And the Jump researchers who are not the Jump traders did this work as far as I can tell. And what they did is they looked at a bunch of trades, they marked them out. So they tried to figure out how profitable they were and then they just, regardless of size, they just kind of ordered them by what profit proportion went to the proposer and then they computed the interquartile range.
01:50:43.628 - 01:51:13.564, Speaker A: So what you're looking at is the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile of how much profit the proposer made. But this is kind of unsatisfactory to me in a number of ways because IQR is like the wrong thing to do because what we're really concerned about is what the average profit or what the total share of the pie that the proposers are getting. It might be vastly different than what the IQR looks like.
01:51:13.564 - 01:51:27.920, Speaker A: Really we want to be dealing with averages and expectations here. The other thing is profit share may systematically vary depending on size. You might expect larger transactions to be more profit or smaller transactions to be more profit.
01:51:27.920 - 01:51:42.416, Speaker A: It's actually going to be larger. The larger the move is, the less profit the proposer is going to take because there's going to be less competition. You might expect it to be different depending on the pair, right? So you really have to go pair by pair.
01:51:42.416 - 01:52:04.232, Speaker A: There's going to be a lot more competition on ETH USDC pair where everybody can trade, everybody can hedge on binance than there is going to be on, I don't know, Shiba USDC or something like that. So competition is going to depend on the pair, profit is going to depend on the pair. And finally the profit share may be different depending on whether the searcher is integrated with their own builder.
01:52:04.232 - 01:52:21.312, Speaker A: Meaning they're submitting the bids to the PBS auction themselves or whether they're independent, which means that they have to submit their transactions to another builder who's not them. And the independent searchers are going to be worse off. So what do we do? We said let's just do a quick check on that.
01:52:21.312 - 01:52:34.100, Speaker A: Let's do our own version of this. So we gathered all the trades, we gathered all the Markouts, which are the prices. The Markouts are basically prices 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds a minute afterwards.
01:52:34.100 - 01:52:51.404, Speaker A: And we decided to calculate trade profit based on those Markouts and then subtract the gas costs and build arrives which we're going to call the share that the proposer and the network gets. And so we did a quick sanity check. Remember that this was the Jump researchers who did this.
01:52:51.404 - 01:53:15.730, Speaker A: So we said let's go take a look at the Jump trading wallet that we have tagged on chain and unsurprisingly to me at least, the number falls within their range. But of course their range was 37% to 77%. But I think the actual number, as you can see based on this, is more like the 77% than the 37% as you can see.
01:53:15.730 - 01:53:41.316, Speaker A: So this was kind of good for me to see because this is what my priors were basically on how profitable they were. And I think just from talking to people it seemed like this was quite well known that it was about 80%, about 75%. So then we just said, okay, well it may be different depending on who is the trader because Jump is like pretty good trader.
01:53:41.316 - 01:53:58.668, Speaker A: So we just went to another random address that does a lot of this sex decks, Arbitrage. And as you can see, they actually had a lower portion. It depends on the markout but they had a lower portion that they kept for themselves and the Proposer actually made a higher portion on theirs.
01:53:58.668 - 01:54:12.356, Speaker A: So both of these that I showed you so far are from independent searchers. So remember I said it could differ depending on whether you're independent or not. So we're going to try and take a look at that.
01:54:12.356 - 01:54:22.244, Speaker A: But first let me say some caveats about what we did. I said it depends on pair. This is only the ETH USDC five bit pair, which is the most competitive pair.
01:54:22.244 - 01:54:40.060, Speaker A: So you might expect on other pairs that the competitiveness would be lower and the Proposer profits would be lower. So it's a shorter time frame. We're going to publish a paper soon and you can see a longer time frame and more robust analysis with more addresses.
01:54:40.060 - 01:54:57.670, Speaker A: And they're independent searchers, like I said. So the question is, does this extend to the integrated builders? So what is different about integrated builders? Integrated builders are they are bidders. They're builders in the PBS auction and they're searchers as well.
01:54:57.670 - 01:55:21.240, Speaker A: So integrated builders, they take their profit in the PBS auction whereas a non integrated or a neutral searcher would take their profit when they submit the bundle to the builder. So they have to decide their profit share at the end, which gives them an advantage. Whereas the non integrated searchers can do that, they have to do that earlier.
01:55:21.240 - 01:55:50.884, Speaker A: So the integrated builders are often going to bid truthfully in the first stage. Remember the integrated builder I showed you at the start who had paid themselves 15 ETH in the bundle share stage, okay? And so that means we need to go block by block basically and we need to score the entire block, mark out the entire block, add up all the other stuff that went on in the block. And then whereas before we could go transaction by transaction, we have to do a whole block at a time.
01:55:50.884 - 01:56:13.100, Speaker A: So this is going to be trickier. Super high volatility blocks are even more tricky because there's so many trades. And the more the price moves, the more you can trade, right? Because now that the price has moved $40, I can trade a lot more than if the price only moved $10 profitably.
01:56:13.100 - 01:56:29.648, Speaker A: And that's just based on slippage on the AMM, right? So when the price moves a lot, you need a huge amount of funds to compete. If you don't have enough, you can't take the size of trade that you need to compete. And some searchers don't have enough.
01:56:29.648 - 01:56:40.580, Speaker A: So let's take a look at that. Here's a few addresses hopefully everybody can see. But on the left I have the addresses of some of the integrated searchers.
01:56:40.580 - 01:56:54.490, Speaker A: The one on top is the holdings of the searcher that did the block that I just showed you at the start of the talk. The one on the bottom is another one. So you can see 50 million, almost 20 million.
01:56:54.490 - 01:57:16.828, Speaker A: And then on the right is one of the addresses that I showed you that was not integrated, and you can see $2 million. But if I went back to the first slide or the first few slides, you would see that the trade size, even on the first trade alone, was $4 million. So of course, the guy on the right is never going to be able to compete.
01:57:16.828 - 01:57:30.870, Speaker A: Or I guess it's your left or my left up here. But the guy who has $2 million can never take a $4 million trade on chain when he doesn't have the money. So that's one of the other tricky things here.
01:57:30.870 - 01:57:48.040, Speaker A: And a final thing I want to talk about here is that there's unobserved costs here that we don't see. And so we can say, hey, these guys are making 20%, they're making a lot of money. They're making $50,000 every two weeks or something like that, which is quite a bit of money for one pair.
01:57:48.040 - 01:58:12.976, Speaker A: But we're not looking at their capital opportunity cost. So if you're like putting $50 million on chain and parking it there and not putting it in any yield generating thing, your opportunity cost is the risk free rate of capital. So you have like 50 million times whatever the risk free rate is.
01:58:12.976 - 01:58:32.388, Speaker A: Now $2.5 million a year that we don't observe necessarily. Another thing that we really don't observe is trader attention or trader salaries or trader costs, right? So these traders like to get paid, right? A lot of them are kind of x HFT in TradFi.
01:58:32.388 - 01:58:40.424, Speaker A: They know what they're doing. They have a lot of other opportunities and so they're demanding a lot of money. So we definitely don't observe that either.
01:58:40.424 - 01:58:54.210, Speaker A: And that eats into their profit margin as well. And the final thing is risk and hedging costs. And you might think these are different, but they're actually the same thing because you either take on the risk or you pay to hedge the risk away.
01:58:54.210 - 01:59:14.660, Speaker A: And these are quite large. So I'm going to go back to all the way to this thing. So they made this trade and if you go and look at the depth on Binance, there's no way they could possibly be hedging this in real time, or if they did, they would be taking a huge haircut.
01:59:14.660 - 01:59:33.064, Speaker A: So these guys are just kind of making a huge directional trade, hoping it goes their way. They have some models that show it does more often than not, but they're making a huge trade and they're hanging a lot of money on the table. Okay, so we have to be careful when we talk about this.
01:59:33.064 - 01:59:58.512, Speaker A: When we look on chain, it looks like they're making a lot of money, but we have to make sure that we're looking at the hidden costs and making sure that we understand that these guys are not getting risk free trading on the centralized exchange. So we're going to have a new paper coming out that goes into more detail on the integrated builder side. Thank you all for listening.
01:59:58.512 - 02:00:25.148, Speaker A: Go check out some full research on this question and who's winning these blocks, who these guys are, what they're doing at our website, mechanism.org. And also follow us on Twitter at special mech where we tweet out a bunch of gifs and informational content that you can kind of see the dark forest illuminated. Yeah, thanks Max for sharing his frontier research.
02:00:25.148 - 02:00:37.330, Speaker A: And I would definitely walk through all the paper by Max. And next up, we have Yaoxi from outlayer to introduce us the magic of Beacon, Layer and Rust. So let's welcome.
02:00:37.330 - 02:01:01.724, Speaker A: Yeah, hello everyone. Yao chi here. So I'm the founder of Allayer and all layer.
02:01:01.724 - 02:01:33.180, Speaker A: Basically, we are building a decentralized interlayer for all the roll apps. And on top of it, as you can see right, we also have a product is no code dashboard which can easily allow developers to launch roll ups in minutes. And today I would like to share a little bit more of all the new updates and progress on our side and I hope can also help everyone here to have a better understanding of the current roll up landscape.
02:01:33.180 - 02:02:01.220, Speaker A: So as you can see, right, for the past two to three years for the interior blockchain space, not just the Ethereum ecosystem, we have so many new developments around this roll up test deck. So as we can see, right, typically we have two categories for the rollups. One is we call classic roll up or smart contract roll up like Optimism, Arbitram and all the different Zke EVMs.
02:02:01.220 - 02:02:37.420, Speaker A: So for them, we have full set of security guarantee and also the bridge and data availability guarantee from the Ethereum. As you can see, for most of these classic roll apps, we launch smart contracts on Ethereum to derive the security guarantee via the fraud proof or validity proof and beyond that, we also have this trust minimized bridge. So that means compared to previously, either Cosmos Polkadot even earlier, or different L ones, we have to have some relayer based bridges.
02:02:37.420 - 02:03:00.244, Speaker A: But right now for most of the classic roll ups we have native bridge which also security guaranteed by the L One via the proving system. And for all these classic roll ups, right, it's quite straightforward to deploy. Like as you can see, right, for example, the Op stack, you can quickly deploy sort of the L Two sequencers.
02:03:00.244 - 02:03:23.996, Speaker A: And at the same time you can deploy contracts on L One, so you can launch a roll up in just a few days. And beyond that, recently we also have this new concept called Sovereign Roll Up, which proposed by Celestia and compared to classic roll apps, right, sovereign Roll Ups. Basically, as you can see from the name, it has more sovereignty.
02:03:23.996 - 02:03:49.160, Speaker A: So basically you will have a group of nodes on the roll up side and you can decide what kind of execution logic you want. So basically you have more freedom to choose how many sequencers you want and how you execute these transactions. And on the other side you have more ability to basically choose how you upgrade the protocol via the half fork.
02:03:49.160 - 02:04:21.088, Speaker A: However, for these two types of roll ups, right, granularly, we figure out there's some sort of drawbacks for these two types of roll ups. For the first one, as you can see, for the existing Midnight version of a lot of these classic or smart contract rollabs, typically we only have a single sequencer like this Optimizium Arbitrum and various Zke EVM rollabs. So in that case, we may encounter some of these single point failure issues.
02:04:21.088 - 02:04:59.080, Speaker A: For example, during the AirDrop, for the optimism Arbitrum, the sequencer was down for a few hours or even over one day. And beyond that, as the speaker just mentioned, there are also different mev and also these front running issues around this single sequencer because right now you don't have many choices compared to a peer to peer network, right now you only have a single sequencer. It's equivalent to a server which can really control who run or execute the transactions compared to the other transactions.
02:04:59.080 - 02:05:17.220, Speaker A: And beyond that, as we all know, there's another hard problem. It's about the upgrade. So for all the solidity, all the blockchain applications, it's actually the same as our traditional software, like our browsers or operating system.
02:05:17.220 - 02:05:54.800, Speaker A: We all have upgrades, we need to basically add new features and sometimes if there are some vulnerabilities, we need to patch these vulnerabilities with some new code, right? So in that case, we need to have a proper upgrade system around these class A roll ups. But right now it's really controlled by some multisate wallet and the developer need to propose the upgrade and then sort of directly leverage the existing contracts on the L ones to do the upgrade. So it's relatively risky compared to if we can really have protocol level upgrade.
02:05:54.800 - 02:06:22.356, Speaker A: Yeah, beyond that for sovereign roll ups because you have more sovereignties of freedom by the same time probably you don't really have the trust minimized bridge compared to the class A roll up. So you really need to rely on some other bridge providers and to provide the bridge across your sovereign roll ups and the other l ones and different chains. And beyond that, compared to these class A roll ups.
02:06:22.356 - 02:06:37.772, Speaker A: For sovereign rollout, you also need to orchestrate the network a little bit. Like for example to get a bunch of these nodes or validators and to compose the l two network. And after that basically you can set up the sovereign roll up.
02:06:37.772 - 02:07:20.012, Speaker A: So the issue here is that you need to contact all the node providers or community nodes to join your network. And then is it possible we find a way to address all these questions and issues and really get a better solution? Yes, there's another type of rollout we call enshrined rollout. Basically as all the issues we just mentioned, either this centralized sequencer or this upgrade issue, or even this minimized bridge issue, we can just enshrine all the proof system bridge logic and also including the data availability logic in protocol level.
02:07:20.012 - 02:07:49.364, Speaker A: So it's sort of like we have all these logic previously written in smart contracts, but right now we make into protocol. It's sort of like in protocol roll up system and in that case assume we have such instrument roll up and together with the l one protocol which can help to enhance with all the logic, especially for the proving system into it. And as you can see right, there are so many benefits we can get.
02:07:49.364 - 02:08:14.296, Speaker A: The first one is really like the upgrade part. So instead of updating the contract with Modesty wallet relatively sort of security less, we can really have these in protocol level upgrade. Basically different nodes can verify sort of the logic and then later they can propose some EIP to upgrade the protocol.
02:08:14.296 - 02:08:45.416, Speaker A: And beyond that, we also have this sort of protocol level security guarantee, basically all the logic including for the bridge and also the proof system, right, since it's big into the protocol, then all the logic will be verified the protocol instead of this contract level. And beyond that, as you can see, right, probably better performance. And we can also leverage the l one nodes to become the sequencers for the l two s.
02:08:45.416 - 02:09:18.752, Speaker A: In that case, we don't have the sort of the concerns around a single sequencer and sometimes once these sequencers behaving maliciously, we can directly slash these sequencers via this l one protocol level security guarantee. But why this insurance roller is so good, right? Why we don't have it? Right now, the biggest hurdle is still about in protocol changes. So, as we just described, right, if we really want to have all these benefits, we have to have somehow changes on the protocol level.
02:09:18.752 - 02:09:48.516, Speaker A: We need the L One protocol to be incorporated with roll up systems to include the logic previously from Smart Contracts. But right now in protocol, for example, like the existing Optimism or Arbitron bridge logic and also the Proof logic, right, we have tons of thousand lines of code insulated, but right now we need to find ways to write them in Go and directly into this Ethereum client. So that's a lot of work.
02:09:48.516 - 02:10:20.304, Speaker A: And at the same time we also need the consensus around the Ethereum community for such a huge change. So at the same time is really sort of a middle ground for us to benefit this instrument roll up approach, but at the same time without much changes on the L One protocol. Yes, so that's sort of the stuff we've been working on for almost two years and we really like to present to the community and also the ecosystem to use is called Beacon layer.
02:10:20.304 - 02:10:50.048, Speaker A: So on our side we are proposing this called instrument interlayer for all the roll apps. As you can see right on the beacon layer side, it's like a decentralized sequencing verification upgrade protocol for all the rollabs. So for the users, if they want to spin off a roll up, they can send a request to this beacon layer network and then later the decentralized sequence survey fire will be assigned for the rollab to bootstrap this sort of the system.
02:10:50.048 - 02:11:04.352, Speaker A: And at the same time we have the full fledged security guarantee from the L ones like Ethereum. So we have the fraud and also ZK proof on the Ethereum side and also trust minimize bridge. For DA.
02:11:04.352 - 02:11:26.128, Speaker A: You can also choose either you want Ethereum or Celestial or Eigen DA. Roughly, the architecture is quite similar to the existing roll up. It's not like we have some extra load balancing system called aggregator because we want to handle millions of transactions and requests.
02:11:26.128 - 02:11:57.908, Speaker A: So where the aggregator side? It will do the load balancing and split the traffic into different sequencers and Verifiers for sequencing and the verification. And beyond that, as I just mentioned, we also have the proof system on the L One just to make sure we really derive the L One's security. Okay, so into the details, right? What are the benefits or the components? The out layer can the beacon layer can really augment at the moment.
02:11:57.908 - 02:12:27.500, Speaker A: The first one, as I mentioned, we have this decentralized network for all the sequencers. So this is just some Sudo code, right? So as you can see, one developer can just send some requests similar to this one to specify the settlement layer like Ethereum or DA layer Celestia and the VM, either you want EVM or WASM. And at the same time you can also specify the tab for your proof system.
02:12:27.500 - 02:12:56.760, Speaker A: Either it's optimistic or it's a ZK proof. And beyond that, the beacon layer will sort of handle all the orchestration for this roll up and by selecting some sequencers from the network and then assign for the developer to set up the roll up. And the second cool part probably is also the first time we introduced for the ecosystem is the decentralized verification.
02:12:56.760 - 02:13:22.956, Speaker A: So once we have a decentralized sequencer site, I just show you basically we can have a relatively better security guarantee because it's multi sequencer compared to a single sequencers like a single point failure. But right now beyond that, the beacon layer can also doing some extra verification work. We call this proof of validity.
02:13:22.956 - 02:13:56.144, Speaker A: So regularly the beacon layer will check the crack needs of the transactions and blocks proposed by the sequencers and also do this quick verification on this beacon layer side. So in that case now we have multiple options for developers, traders and also users regarding the finality. So one as you can see right on the sequencer side we have this multi sequencer so it's relatively better security guarantee and the finality compared to the single sequencer.
02:13:56.144 - 02:14:19.868, Speaker A: So at that level we can achieve less than two second sort of latency. Beyond that, beacon layer provides this extra verification finality for you and that's so called harder than softer finality and it's also within minutes compared to the L One level security. And beyond that for some exchanges, right, they really want the L One liable security guarantee.
02:14:19.868 - 02:14:59.010, Speaker A: In that case we also have this fraud and ZK proof and just to make sure the L One also confirmed the transaction or blocks are finalized on their side. And beyond that it's also the first time for us to propose this average proof model compared just this optimistic proof or the fraud proof. We also add these ZK components to Snark or basically generate the ZK proofs option for some of the components for the fraud proof and later you can verify on the ethereum side.
02:14:59.010 - 02:15:37.240, Speaker A: Beyond that, as I mentioned, upgrade is a big feature for a lot of protocols and for us we really sort of introduced this forklist upgrade. So the developers and also the protocols, they can just generate the new binaries and new features via the WASM and later they will be passed across all the protocol. And beyond that we are collaborating with Eigen layer to introduce the risk into the system because we have a full flight approved system so we know how to do the staking and slashing.
02:15:37.240 - 02:15:56.188, Speaker A: The details will be announced on Friday and probably next time on the dev connect. Okay, this is a very cool and decentralized protocol right on top of it. What are the concrete use cases we are building? The first one is sort of like this full flight or versatile roll up stack.
02:15:56.188 - 02:16:40.408, Speaker A: You can choose different sequencer or DA layer and even interoperability layer you want and you can also choose different types of roll apps you want and via our no code dashboard you can quickly choose the parameters and launch it on this dashboard within a few minutes and it's already live on the website. You can just try it out. And beyond that we also help a bunch of projects already launch a bunch of campaigns either for NFT issuing either for these kind of events ticketing like the football match in Malaysia and beyond that right now we have a very big ecosystem.
02:16:40.408 - 02:17:05.184, Speaker A: So beyond sort of the roll up stack we can provide for all the developers. Now for any sort of applications, especially gaming applications, we are collaborating some big studios in the space and to help them to provide the fully on chain game. And also Ticketing and NFT quest here I also bring this very interesting game.
02:17:05.184 - 02:17:16.628, Speaker A: It will be included in our next campaign. You can just try out this one is our game focused roll up. It's less than 100 millisecond and zero gas, very high TPS.
02:17:16.628 - 02:17:33.472, Speaker A: So for all the users or players, right, you can just try out this game. So every move is a transaction on chain. So we just want to show that for fully on chain game we can really provide the same user experience without latency in this crypto native world.
02:17:33.472 - 02:17:56.652, Speaker A: And in the future for all the users and the players and developer you can just try out to build fully on chain applications using our tech stack without concerning about the infrastructure provisioning. Yeah, that's sort of all the staff around earlier. Just feel free to check out our documentation and we'd like all developers to try out our staff.
02:17:56.652 - 02:18:01.320, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. Yeah. Thanks.
02:18:01.320 - 02:18:13.864, Speaker A: Yao Chi, do try out Alayu's product. Super fun. And to wrap up this section, we finally have our final guest, Nick White from Celestia to talk about modular world more deeply.
02:18:13.864 - 02:18:34.670, Speaker A: So let's welcome Nick White. Hey guys, excited to be here. Thanks seven X for hosting me.
02:18:34.670 - 02:18:50.080, Speaker A: I'm excited to talk to you guys about the dawn of the modular blockchain era. So just a bit about me. I'm Nick White, I'm the COO of Celestia Labs and Celestia is pioneering this new blockchain architecture that we call modular.
02:18:50.080 - 02:19:15.694, Speaker A: Oh, okay. So just to give some context and zoom out a little bit, in our view there's been sort of like three major sort of evolutions in blockchains. First was Bitcoin which proved that you could actually build a decentralized application using blockchain.
02:19:15.694 - 02:19:35.066, Speaker A: And then Ethereum generalized that to make blockchains more useful because it made it programmable. And then finally we're entering a new era which we call the modular blockchain era which we think is going to expand both the scalability and functionality of blockchains. Sorry, it's kind of confusing here.
02:19:35.066 - 02:19:50.202, Speaker A: So an analogy to understand this evolution is that bitcoin was sort of like a calculator. It had very minimal functionality, it could only do a handful of operations. And then Ethereum came along and said hey, we can build a blockchain that's fully programmable.
02:19:50.202 - 02:20:11.202, Speaker A: So Ethereum is kind of like a computer. You can write code, write applications and run it on top of Ethereum. So it's really flexible, it's like a computer, it's turning complete, right? And then Celestia has come along and said actually we're going to generalize blockchains to make them more scalable and even more flexible.
02:20:11.202 - 02:20:25.350, Speaker A: Sort of like cloud computing. So I think that's one way to understand what modular blockchains are is they're like the cloud computing platform for Web Three. Sorry, this clicker is confusing.
02:20:25.350 - 02:20:49.902, Speaker A: And so you might be wondering, well, what are modular blockchains? Well, you have to understand what we're coming from, which are monolithic blockchains. And a monolithic blockchain is everything from bitcoin to Ethereum to salana to every L, one chain that currently exists. And a monolithic chain puts all of the functions of a blockchain into one single protocol executed by one single group of nodes.
02:20:49.902 - 02:21:17.414, Speaker A: And a monitor blockchain basically says hey, we can decouple these different layers into different protocols and then those protocols can specialize in that function and we can recombine them to build a better sort of end app platform. And so I'll just go over some of the benefits of building modular blockchain. So the first is that for the first time we can have a truly scalable blockchain infrastructure.
02:21:17.414 - 02:21:30.494, Speaker A: So in a monolithic chain you have a fixed block size. In a modular chain you can increase the size of the blocks, the number of transactions you can process with the number of nodes in the network. So this is a very, very powerful thing.
02:21:30.494 - 02:21:57.106, Speaker A: That means that a modular chain can scale with the number of users and this will make a huge difference when it comes to the fees on chain. And so in a monolithic chain, when there's a finite amount of block space but there's more users and more applications joining the network, there's more demand for that block space and eventually you get saturated and then fees have to go up. And this has happened again and again on chains like Ethereum.
02:21:57.106 - 02:22:14.110, Speaker A: And in a modular chain you can continue to expand the block space. So even as more applications and users come and demand more block space, you don't have to increase the fees, you just increase the supply. So fees can remain constant even as the ecosystem grows.
02:22:14.110 - 02:22:42.294, Speaker A: And then another part of this is that execution is separated from the bottom layers of the stack. And what this means is that you can have way more flexibility over the kind of execution environment that you run on a modular blockchain like Celestia. So one way to understand this is like imagine you have a computer but it can only run Windows, right? Then that really limits the number of applications you can run.
02:22:42.294 - 02:22:57.866, Speaker A: You can't run Mac applications or Linux applications on top of a Windows machine. And this is what monolithic blockchains do. They inherently come preloaded with a fixed operating system, also known as a virtual machine like the EVM or the c level VM in Solana's case.
02:22:57.866 - 02:23:16.140, Speaker A: And that limits the kind of applications that people can build on them and limits the functionality. In a modular blockchain, it's just a raw computer on which you can load and run whatever operating system you want. Hold on.
02:23:16.140 - 02:23:43.750, Speaker A: Okay, and then a last piece. Another advantage is that a monolithic ecosystem, you end up with these silos, these kind of like independent pools of security that have to be bootstrapped from scratch and when they try to connect with each other, have to make trust assumptions on the counterparty chains. In a modular ecosystem, when you want to deploy a new blockchain, a new execution layer, you can plug into a preexisting resource of security.
02:23:43.750 - 02:23:56.500, Speaker A: And when you want to interoperate with other execution layers, you can have trust minimized bridging. So this is a major unlock. And so to summarize the advantages of modular blockchains, we have scalability.
02:23:56.500 - 02:24:16.130, Speaker A: You can increase the block size with the number of nodes in the network. You have shared security which allows you to quickly launch your own secure chain and bridge securely to other chains in the ecosystem. And then finally you have sovereignty where you have the flexibility to customize and build on the stack that you want.
02:24:16.130 - 02:24:46.404, Speaker A: So these are the main benefits of a modular system. And I want to bring it full circle back to this analogy that I mentioned about modular blockchains being similar to cloud computing in the Web Two context. So in Web Two, the way that most of the sort of like web Two Internet runs is on the cloud, right? And the cloud has at the base data centers.
02:24:46.404 - 02:25:12.400, Speaker A: And data centers are these resources, a shared resource of compute. And the developers, web Two developers come to the data center and they say, hey, I need this much compute and I want to run a custom virtual machine to service my application. I want to be able to scale it down or up as demand necessitates.
02:25:12.400 - 02:25:37.716, Speaker A: And the modular stack is very much the same model in Web Three. But instead of having a data center, you have a data network like Celestia. And Celestia provides this raw resource of block space on which any developer can come and say, I want to consume some of this block space, and I want to run a custom virtual blockchain, also known as a roll up, on your chain.
02:25:37.716 - 02:25:53.950, Speaker A: And I want to be able to scale it up and down, and I want to customize it for my end application. So there's a lot of parallels here and I think that's what makes the modular stack so compelling. We've already seen the success of this type of architecture in web Two.
02:25:53.950 - 02:26:13.780, Speaker A: So I want to talk a little bit about how this stuff works under the hood. So again, we have to compare with monolithic chains. So in a monolithic chain, when you want to run a node and verify the chain, you have to download every single transaction, and then you have to verify every single transaction one by one.
02:26:13.780 - 02:26:39.070, Speaker A: And the problem is that node operators have a finite amount of bandwidth to download data and they have a finite amount of compute to verify transactions. So what that means is there's a finite amount of transactions that they can download and verify. So that creates an upper bound, like a fixed amount maximum of block space or transactions that can be processed by the system.
02:26:39.070 - 02:27:12.180, Speaker A: And that's just something that can't really be overcome. And in a modular context, there are two key innovations that change this dynamic and make it so that you can actually increase the number of transactions while still retaining the core functionality of being verifiable. So the first is that rather than having to verify every single transaction one by one, in a modular blockchain, you use what's called a roll up, which enables you to verify a batch of transactions with a single proof.
02:27:12.180 - 02:27:24.340, Speaker A: So this scales the execution component of blockchains. And then you still need to download and verify that all the transactions were published. You need to make sure that the data is available.
02:27:24.340 - 02:27:43.020, Speaker A: And in Celestia, we've solved this by doing something called data availability sampling, which allows you to verify that all those transactions were published without having to download each one of them. And instead, you just download a small sample of the overall data. So let's say you have a ten megabyte block.
02:27:43.020 - 02:28:08.696, Speaker A: You only have to download about 10 data to verify that it was published. And the number of samples does not increase even as the block size increases. So this is similar to the underlying technology, uses something called erasure coding, which is something that is used in QR codes and CDROMs and throughout other aspects of technology.
02:28:08.696 - 02:28:37.490, Speaker A: And you'll see, if you try to scan these QR codes that the QR code on the right still works even though it's missing a lot of data. And so similarly in Celestia, when you are sampling the block, if a block producer wants to hide any data, they have to hide a huge amount of data in order to get away with that kind of attack. And so this is what powers the data availability sampling that allows us to scale block space.
02:28:37.490 - 02:28:50.628, Speaker A: And I want to just note for everyone in the audience that you should not confuse data availability for data storage. They're completely different things. Data storage is sort of like storing food.
02:28:50.628 - 02:29:06.456, Speaker A: It would be like, I want to can food and store it away in a warehouse so I can eat it later. Right? You want to put data away and know that you can retrieve it when you need it in the future. And data availability is more like an all you can eat buffet.
02:29:06.456 - 02:29:36.464, Speaker A: It's trying to serve data out to as many people as possible and enable them to sample from each dish and verify that all of the food that's supposed to be in the block and in the buffet is actually there. And so it's about fresh data, it's about new data and ensuring and verifying the chain rather than storing data. And what's really cool about modular blockchains is that they enable an entirely new type of node that's never existed before called a light node.
02:29:36.464 - 02:30:16.400, Speaker A: So what a light node is, is it's a way for end users to verify blockchains on their phone or any kind of really lightweight device. And we've had people running light nodes on phones, on Nintendo switches, on lots and lots of different pieces of hardware like Kindles and everything, just to show that now with modular blockchains, it's actually possible for anyone in the world practically to verify the chain directly. And this is a huge boon for decentralization of blockchain networks because end users verifying the chain are what secure blockchains.
02:30:16.400 - 02:30:51.544, Speaker A: And so here's an image of one of our team members, Josh, running a light node on his phone just a few months ago in Paris. And last thing, it's more touching on the social aspect of the modular movement, which is that in the monolithic world and the monolithic framework, you have these isolated l ones that are not sharing resources, not sharing innovation. They're pitted against each other in sort of a zero sum competition for, for adoption and mindshare.
02:30:51.544 - 02:31:17.540, Speaker A: And in the modular approach, you know, you, you split this up and you enable different chains and different projects to collaborate and share innovation. And so it becomes a much more positive sum ecosystem that can innovate much faster. And so I'm really excited about this aspect of modular blockchains aside from just the technology, the social aspect of and we call this modularism, not maximalism.
02:31:17.540 - 02:31:52.400, Speaker A: And the modular ecosystem has been growing significantly just in the past year. It's almost tripled in size and there's tons of new it's not just that there's more projects building the same things, there are actually new layers that have emerged to kind of service other aspects of building blockchains in a decentralized modular way. And I expect this trend to continue where more and more of the blockchain stack, overall modularizes and more and more teams join into this movement.
02:31:52.400 - 02:32:23.808, Speaker A: So it's a really exciting time. And last but not least, Celestia is very close to launching our main net. And this is going to be a huge shift in the sort of like history of blockchains in that for the first time we'll have a network that has live data availability, sampling, and we'll be able to scale decentralized block space for rollups and for applications.
02:32:23.808 - 02:32:40.130, Speaker A: But I have this slide here because mainnet launch is really just the first step for Celestia. And once we launch, we have another goalpost that we've set for ourselves down in the coming years. And that is this.
02:32:40.130 - 02:33:09.304, Speaker A: We want to get to a place where we have 1GB blocks, 1 million roll ups and 1 billion light nodes. So what this means is for the 1GB blocks, this is about scaling the underlying block space so that we can actually support global usage of blockchain and encrypto. And we think it's possible using data availability sampling, to scale to this size.
02:33:09.304 - 02:33:37.504, Speaker A: And the second point, about 1 million roll ups, is that we want to make it as easy to deploy a roll up as it is to deploy a smart contract. And we want to enable, in the same way that Ethereum enabled all this innovation experimentation at the smart contract layer, we want to enable experimentation and innovation at the roll up execution layer. And we think that this is going to unlock again, another wave of new types of applications that could not exist before.
02:33:37.504 - 02:33:55.524, Speaker A: And so hopefully, by having this bloom of a million roll ups, we'll get there. And then the last point is 1 billion light nodes. And what this refers to is that part of what scales these blockchains and also what makes them decentralized, as I said, is users verifying the chain.
02:33:55.524 - 02:34:20.032, Speaker A: And so we need to build a system where we can have end users verifying Celestia and running nodes at scale. And we believe that we can do this by embedding light nodes into wallets and into browsers and making it sort of a cultural aspect of the modular ecosystem. And that's all I have today.
02:34:20.032 - 02:34:37.350, Speaker A: So hopefully you're inspired by the modular movement and you guys want to build or participate and you can find me on Twitter and our website is celestia.org. And stay tuned for the next couple of months for our mainnet launch. So thank you so much.
02:34:37.350 - 02:34:57.020, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks Nick, for giving our last talks in the modular section. And we are going to have a five minutes break. And if you're interested in modular and want to recap all the talks in the morning, we will have recordings and summary releasing later, so feel free to check out.
02:34:57.020 - 02:35:12.924, Speaker A: And after the five minutes break, we're going to have our next session keynotes on security and privacy. We'll have speakers from Goplus and Alio, so make sure come back in five minutes and feel free to walk around and chat with each other. Yeah.
02:35:12.924 - 02:36:41.300, Speaker A: Thank you, Sam. SA. Yeah, and also a reminder that we have lunch provided later, so feel free to take some lunch after the speakers.
02:36:41.300 - 02:39:26.952, Speaker A: WAM it. WAM it's. Dam it's time to come back.
02:39:26.952 - 02:39:39.260, Speaker A: We have two more exciting talks in the morning. And first, let's welcome Alex from Aalio to introduce us the magic of a little. And now it's your stage.
02:39:39.260 - 02:39:48.992, Speaker A: Thank you very much and thank you everyone for hosting me. I hope everyone is having a good time and staying cool in Singapore. Cool.
02:39:48.992 - 02:40:17.844, Speaker A: So today I want to talk to you guys about building an actually secure Internet with Alio. So actually I chose the term Internet over Web Three because I actually think that zero knowledge cryptography, which is a lot of what I'm going to talk about today has applications beyond just Web Three. And I think there's a lot of opportunity to bridge what I think is some very exciting potential integration with the financial system through Web Three, with Web Two via zero knowledge cryptography.
02:40:17.844 - 02:40:40.450, Speaker A: So when my wife asks me, or while my mom's or my mother in law asks me what do I do for a living, I usually tell her not that I work in blockchain, but that I work in cybersecurity. Because I think that zero knowledge cryptography can actually help secure the information, financial and otherwise, that we care about online. So with that, let's jump into it.
02:40:40.450 - 02:40:52.820, Speaker A: There we go. So here's what I'm going to talk about today. I'm going to talk a little about Web Three protocols, how they evolved and why they evolved the way they did, namely without privacy.
02:40:52.820 - 02:41:11.720, Speaker A: Without privacy and how that happened. I'm going to talk about a little bit what we do at Alio. And I'm going to talk about how we enable privacy at the smart contract layer One, and how that privacy doesn't have to come at the cost of compliance.
02:41:11.720 - 02:41:31.164, Speaker A: I'm going to talk a little bit more in detail about our computing model and how to think about deploying smart contracts on Alio and how that's different from other ecosystems like Ethereum. And I'm maybe going to talk a little bit about why we decided to go the separate layer One route because that's a question we get a lot. Lastly, I'm going to talk about some of the use cases, which I'm really excited about, that are unlocked by zero knowledge cryptography.
02:41:31.164 - 02:41:47.044, Speaker A: So with that, let's get in. So I like to think of Alio as a step along the path of the evolution of Web Three protocols. So in the beginning we have all these kind of the far side of the slide there, see all these protocols that the world has largely forgotten about.
02:41:47.044 - 02:42:29.816, Speaker A: But that inspired Bitcoin, which was the first cryptocurrency, right? So these are many of David Sham's projects like Hash Cash and a bunch of others that are listed there, right? And the key unlock for Bitcoin was this concept of crypto economic security, which I'm sure you guys remember, this was like the key piece in the Bitcoin white paper is economically incentivizing the miners to cooperate and work together. And this kind of led to a whole path of spinoffs, effectively litecoin, et cetera, that followed this approach. And then Vitalik and his co founders of Ethereum came along and they said, hey, this is a great paradigm, but if we could marry this with smart contracts, we could increase the programmability, then we would be able to do much more with this, become much more practical.
02:42:29.816 - 02:42:45.210, Speaker A: And so this was really when this is the advent of the virtual machine on chain. So the Ethereum virtual machine was the first on chain VM, and we had many effectively forks either philosophically or very practically from Ethereum. And I've listed a few of them there.
02:42:45.210 - 02:43:07.920, Speaker A: But I think there's another unexplored path that hasn't been taken yet, and that is around extending Zcash. My pointer works. So Zcash is, what if we extended Zcash to enable general smart contracts and therefore achieve both the programmability of Ethereum and the privacy properties that make Zcash attractive.
02:43:07.920 - 02:43:16.944, Speaker A: So, yep, this is pretty much what I just said. We have Bitcoin, which is public money, zcash is private money. Ethereum is public apps.
02:43:16.944 - 02:43:29.636, Speaker A: And you can guess it'll be a pop quiz later what's going in that top. Right? What we want is private applications. And so this is just a quick summary of kind of the different approaches and what they give you.
02:43:29.636 - 02:43:44.952, Speaker A: Early systems had the problem of not being decentralized. There was always some single party point of failure that you had to rely on in order to assure the system was available and functioned as designed. Bitcoin solved that, of course, by this concept of proof of work, but it wasn't interoperable.
02:43:44.952 - 02:44:09.620, Speaker A: What I like to say, by when I say interoperable, I mean you can't have integration between programs on chain. You can't have smart contracts, right? Ethereum, of course, brought smart contracts, but unfortunately it was no longer or was not privacy preserving, and neither was Bitcoin. Right? So we actually have never had a decentralized and let me actually use a different word, permissionless system for privacy preserving computation.
02:44:09.620 - 02:44:32.968, Speaker A: And I think this is a big reason why I don't think crypto has gotten the adoption that I think it should. If you look at the traditional financial system and the UX, so to speak, the user experience of me sending one of you a bank wire is, you know that you got paid by me, I know that I paid you. The bank knows that there was a transaction and some compliance process was followed.
02:44:32.968 - 02:44:46.272, Speaker A: But the rest of the world does not see that transaction. Right. In crypto, I mean, there's many firms that specialize in looking at the transaction graph and all the activity on chain and identifying exactly who is paying who.
02:44:46.272 - 02:45:16.196, Speaker A: And once a single transaction is revealed to be yours, basically anyone with a computer can effectively Google or go to an Explorer and find out everything about you and your financial life. So I think for most DeFi use cases today, which I think much of which is speculative, that may be okay, but for real world financial use cases, this is problematic. And I kind of liken this if we go back in history to the Internet or the early days of the Web browser.
02:45:16.196 - 02:45:31.496, Speaker A: So this is the logo for Netscape. I'm old enough to actually have used Netscape, and one of the things that Netscape did was it supported the development of the secure socket layer for the Internet. Before that, all Internet traffic was effectively unencrypted.
02:45:31.496 - 02:45:44.640, Speaker A: Right? So Http traffic, if you read the Http protocol. There's no encryption as part of that. Right? So TLS is the encryption is a protocol for encryption and encryption that's used online.
02:45:44.640 - 02:46:01.412, Speaker A: And that basically makes up that's how we get Https. Right? And SSL was a key part of TLS, and this is what Netscape really pioneered. And that was the big unlock, I would argue, for web two commerce right now for the first time, this is in the 90s.
02:46:01.412 - 02:46:26.270, Speaker A: You could send a credit card transaction online without worrying about a man in the middle attack someone just reading off your credit card info and using that for some other purpose. So, of course, we don't have the issue of someone being able to take your private key unless you give it to them in crypto. But nonetheless, the transparency of the current paradigm, I think, is similar to how the early Internet was before encrypted transactions and the early Internet before it had the commercial value that it does today.
02:46:26.270 - 02:47:11.820, Speaker A: Okay? And so at this point, usually by this point in the pitch when I'm talking to people, they're like, that's all great, but how do we ensure that the bad people in the world don't use this protocol for bad things? My simple answer to that is that people will always use bad there will always be people who will use technology that's neutral for bad things. But nonetheless, I think it is important to talk about how compliance and regulation can fit into this paradigm because as we've seen in the last year, protocols like Tornado Cash and their founders can, there could be legal consequences for working on some of this. And in addition, I think there's also some pretty exciting proposals such as privacy pools on Ethereum, which is something that we basically have support for natively on Alio, for enabling privacy on chain while still maintaining compliance.
02:47:11.820 - 02:47:23.744, Speaker A: This is a quote, which I like is actually the US. Government's treasury report on the illicit finance risk assessment of decentralized finance. So the US.
02:47:23.744 - 02:47:40.036, Speaker A: Government actually supports technologies that are privacy preserving but allow for compliance and AML CFT obligations. And I think in any real practical world, we have to consider this as we're building systems that are privacy preserving. Okay, so I already spoiled the surprise here.
02:47:40.036 - 02:47:48.484, Speaker A: Alio fits in up here. It's an extension of zcash and ethereum. It really marries the best of both worlds and enables compliance.
02:47:48.484 - 02:48:04.844, Speaker A: I'm going to talk to you a little bit more about Alio now. Okay, so what is alio? So, like I said, it's a new layer one blockchain. Maybe it's a good time to digress and say, why did we build a new layer one blockchain? Why are we not a roll up like every other ZK project? Well, we had two goals.
02:48:04.844 - 02:48:15.708, Speaker A: One was to enable privacy. And most roll ups, despite the name ZK rollups, actually don't use the ZK property in ZK snarks. So ZK Snarks stands for zero knowledge.
02:48:15.708 - 02:48:29.356, Speaker A: Succinct, non interactive arguments of knowledge. Wow. Most roll ups use the succinctness property, which is to say that you have a long or large computation and you compress that computation into a small proof of validity.
02:48:29.356 - 02:48:41.276, Speaker A: Right. But most every ZK roll up on Ethereum that I know of today does not actually use the ZK property, which, strictly defined as the Verifier, learns nothing about the proof that they're verifying. Right.
02:48:41.276 - 02:49:00.764, Speaker A: So the privacy preserving element. So, in order to get privacy, we decided to create our own layer one that's in a slightly different model than Ethereum's account model, which is helpful. And then also by building a layer one up from scratch, we're able to use cryptographic primitives that are much more conducive to performance ZK snark.
02:49:00.764 - 02:49:07.344, Speaker A: So this is our stack. So Snark OS is the blockchain so standard. This is a client node you run to participate in the network.
02:49:07.344 - 02:49:24.164, Speaker A: We run a consensus algorithm called Bullshark Narwhal, similar to Sui and Aptos. And we have an added feature, which is a proof of work kind of mining aspect as well, where we have provers. I guess miners in our system are called provers and they submit work to the network in exchange for economic reward.
02:49:24.164 - 02:49:35.880, Speaker A: They don't participate in consensus, that's the validators. But they are an essential part of the economic distribution of Alio credits, which is the base layer asset on our network. Snark VM is our equivalent of the EVM.
02:49:35.880 - 02:49:55.020, Speaker A: The one thing that I'll say about this is it unlocks because this whole VM is built using zero knowledge proofs, it unlocks some new use cases that aren't possible in Ethereum. And let me just explain what I mean by that. In Ethereum, in order to prevent dos attacks against the network and spam transactions, they introduced this concept of gas.
02:49:55.020 - 02:50:00.948, Speaker A: Right. Gas effectively limits the amount of computation that you can do within a single block. Right.
02:50:00.948 - 02:50:20.680, Speaker A: Each block has a gas limit and all the applications or all the transactions that are processed within a given block have to take a share of that gas limit. In Alio, we don't have a concept of Gas. Why is that? Because all the computation happens off chain and then you generate a zero knowledge proof on chain which is matched with a deployed program.
02:50:20.680 - 02:50:54.308, Speaker A: So someone who's verifying the proof and aka the client knows on the network look at the program ID of the transaction being sent to the network, verify the zero knowledge proof and ensure that that proof and the transaction correspond with the given program ID that's deployed in the Smart contract registry or the program registry. And so, practically speaking, I'll talk more about this in the application section. What does this unlock? Well, for example, if you wanted to do a very heavy duty machine learning algorithm and have that affect some change or state update on chain, you would not be able to do that in Ethereum because it would blow through the gas limit very quickly.
02:50:54.308 - 02:51:11.444, Speaker A: Whereas here you can run that algorithm, you could run that computation and wrap a proof around it for years and then submit that transaction on the network and it's still valid. So that's, I think, one of the elements there that differentiates us from other layer ones that are typically or smart contract layer ones. And lastly, let me talk about Leo.
02:51:11.444 - 02:51:27.340, Speaker A: Leo is our domain specific smart contract language that's basically purpose built for writing programs that take advantage of ZK snarks. So I'll talk about a little bit more about all of these. Okay, this is kind of more of a visual representation.
02:51:27.340 - 02:51:41.060, Speaker A: I'm going to kind of skip through this so we can continue to move on. So this was something I kind of hinted at earlier. I kind of briefly mentioned that Ethereum, it's very hard to get privacy in the model, in the account model.
02:51:41.060 - 02:51:55.368, Speaker A: In fact, Tornado Cash actually had this problem. It was pretty easy to disaggregate which accounts had touched the Tornado Cash smart contract. And largely because the privacy pool was like the pool of people using it was small.
02:51:55.368 - 02:52:12.796, Speaker A: But in general, the account model gives much weaker privacy guarantees than the record model, the UTXO model. And we use kind of a blend of the two called the record model. So here's a couple of other pieces that I mentioned, or pieces of our participants in our protocol that I mentioned.
02:52:12.796 - 02:52:22.752, Speaker A: We have validators that run consensus on Snark. OS, we have provers that generate transactions on Snark VM, and we have developers that write programs in Leo. Cool.
02:52:22.752 - 02:52:30.000, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is just I'm going to walk through a quick flow of how it works quickly. So if you're a developer and you want to write a program, you write your program in Leo.
02:52:30.000 - 02:52:51.000, Speaker A: You deploy that program as part of a deployment transaction. The logic of the program gets uploaded to the program registry and then others can reference it. In this case, callers or users can take a program, generate a transaction with their secret inputs to the program which are private, and send that transaction as a zero knowledge proof on chain which is verified by the network notes.
02:52:51.000 - 02:53:11.840, Speaker A: And so this actually opens up the door to a whole new, I think, cloud services business, which is third party proving services, which can prove on behalf of users. And I think folks in the room who have come from the hardware world or the mining world, I think this is really exciting because I think this is a potential great use case for specialized hardware. Okay, cool.
02:53:11.840 - 02:53:32.436, Speaker A: So no reexecution is kind of the main feature here. The other advantage of this, which I haven't talked about, the performance piece, is that by virtue of how transactions are constructed, every transaction is effectively a roll up. So you can actually pack 64 transitions or like simple transfers into a single transaction.
02:53:32.436 - 02:53:43.876, Speaker A: So you kind of get the roll up architecture for free. Here. And of course with that you get the cryptographic integrity of each transaction through the cryptographic proofs TLDR.
02:53:43.876 - 02:53:56.480, Speaker A: It's very scalable relative to other approaches on layer two Ethereum. So here's some use cases I'm really excited about. I'm going to talk about one here really quick because I think it's kind of the most interesting and exciting one is identity.
02:53:56.480 - 02:54:17.220, Speaker A: Identity and a permissionless identity authentication protocol is something that's missing not just from Web Three, but from Web Two. And I think, again, as we start seeing governments and regulators take more interest in Web Three, we're going to see a lot of demand for KYC type products on chain. And I think zero knowledge cryptography is perfect for this use case.
02:54:17.220 - 02:54:40.716, Speaker A: And so we've actually kind of focused on this initially and deployed our own proof of concept application called ZPass, which I might have a slide about here in a minute to basically use a government issued ID upload that on the Alial blockchain as an encrypted record and then enable users to be able to prove about that all in a completely permissionless way. I think that identity piece is what enables compliant finance. And then I think there's many other cool use cases too.
02:54:40.716 - 02:55:00.384, Speaker A: I'm not going to talk much about gaming, but for those of you who have been in the Ethereum ecosystem for a while, dark Forest, I think was a really cool proof of concept that I hope we can support things like that on Alia. Cool. So where are we? What we've been building for three and a half years? We're preparing to launch Mainet launch in December.
02:55:00.384 - 02:55:22.700, Speaker A: We have 200 applications on our testnet, a lot of adoption of Leo. And overall, we're looking to build and develop the developer ecosystem and hopefully inspire folks to build some of the applications that I mentioned a couple slides ago. So here is some list of resources about Alio and Leo, and I want to thank everyone very much for their time and attention.
02:55:22.700 - 02:55:43.772, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks Alex, for sharing insights about the privacy side. And next we have speaker for the security side stem from Goplus. And before our next talk, I would love to give our special thanks again to our sponsors dodo, Matrix, and Goplus.
02:55:43.772 - 02:55:50.340, Speaker A: And also, thanks for our strategic medium, partner. Odaily. Now let's welcome Stan.
02:55:50.340 - 02:56:27.980, Speaker A: Okay, hello everyone. I'm Stan BD at Goplus, and it's very nice to see all of you, and it's nice to be here. And actually, because of my work, been talking and meeting with a lot of users and projects who have the needs of user security for Web Three.
02:56:27.980 - 02:56:59.202, Speaker A: Today I want to share something with you about Web Three user security on users perspective. Okay, talking about user security. So ask yourself what's the first thing comes to your mind? Right, I think most of the people think like auditing, right? But auditing is actually B two B service.
02:56:59.202 - 02:57:24.780, Speaker A: Right? But actually user security is B two C. But why most of people think of auditing, because there's a lack of awareness and education and infrastructure and services on user security side. So actually there are many, many risks that the user might be facing when they enter to Web Three.
02:57:24.780 - 02:58:06.490, Speaker A: So let's take the user's journey here, right? I believe centralized exchange is the entry for most of the users when they come to Web Three. So at this point, users facing the risks that exchanges like going bankrupt or running with funds or getting hacked. But actually some users already lost their fund because they send their money to some scam addresses or wrong address when they transferring the money out from the exchange.
02:58:06.490 - 02:58:32.100, Speaker A: And then some users, they download their wallet and now they holding their own private key. Okay, so welcome to the decentralized dark forest site, right? So we said like, not your key, not your money. And from this point, users have to take care of themselves and take all the risks on their own.
02:58:32.100 - 02:58:57.580, Speaker A: So now they might face the risks like when they interact with some protocol or the apps or websites. They're like phishing sites, scam approval, fake NFTs, honey pot tokens. And also they might face compliance and regulation risks if they interact with some malicious address.
02:58:57.580 - 02:59:22.254, Speaker A: And of course there are many other risks like we mentioned, like project got hacked. Also like rug pool or Scam air job, blah blah blah. So in short, web Three user security is very important because Web Three users are facing risks from many different dimensions and scenarios.
02:59:22.254 - 03:00:24.470, Speaker A: So who's going to protect them? There are almost 20% addresses directly or indirectly related to attacking protocols. So here's the question would you like to participate in something like this or how can we achieve mass adoption on this situation? What do we have now for Web Three security? What's the situation? So, in the entire industry now, we have multimillion DApps, ten plus million smart contracts and 100 plus auditing firms. So as you can see, we have so little security resources and they are operationing in operating in a low efficiency and a divided manner.
03:00:24.470 - 03:00:49.210, Speaker A: So come to the user side, right? There are very limited security service but so many risks in the journey. Meanwhile, the project parties do not have many user security solutions. But while there are some security builders in this industry and Goplus is honored to be one of them.
03:00:49.210 - 03:01:06.472, Speaker A: So what is Goplus building? Goplus is a Web Three user security infrastructure. So we're providing data to support the security builders. So we have security APIs cover two scenarios.
03:01:06.472 - 03:01:44.964, Speaker A: One is digital asset safety. So we have the API checking the contract backdoors for the tokens and NFTs, for example, see if that's malicious, see if that's a mintable function or whitelist blacklist feature and anti well, and also in other scenario we cover and try to build a safer trading environment. For example, we have API for phishing site and malicious address and DApps and also come to the wallets.
03:01:44.964 - 03:02:03.396, Speaker A: We have approval revoke and also signature decoding. So now we support 21 chains and have detected 3.8 million tokens.
03:02:03.396 - 03:02:39.252, Speaker A: And the API data call in the peak days have reached 20 million and there are more than two and a half independent IPS have called Go plus API and back to two and a half years ago when we just launched the API. So the data corporate day was 2000. So what's trending, right? So there was like a ten k growth times growth in the API calls.
03:02:39.252 - 03:03:04.530, Speaker A: So user security needs are constantly increasing at the same time, due to the development of technology and applications, user interaction scenarios have changed. So that has brought new user risk scenarios. So for example, right, like intents are the new features for transactions and there will be new security needs after that.
03:03:04.530 - 03:03:42.236, Speaker A: So what's the challenge here? Right, so users need more security services and applications to cover the increasing scenarios. And for the business side, people now need more accurate and reliable data, but it's hard for them to choose and verify when there's a conflict. So how to solve the problems? We understand that we have our own capability and one team cannot do everything on its own.
03:03:42.236 - 03:04:20.564, Speaker A: So think about this what if we build a decentralized web three user security network and then everyone can participate and share data and verify the data. And also based on this we could build a security wire ecosystem to support developers to create security applications covering the increasing user security scenarios. So firstly, let's take a look at the security data verification layer.
03:04:20.564 - 03:04:44.640, Speaker A: And on this layer decentralization ensures the data is not controlled and manipulated by a single entity, so enhancing the trust and reliability. And anyone can join the network as a data contributor or data verification node. So this will help the network to reach consensus.
03:04:44.640 - 03:05:27.196, Speaker A: So in the sacWell ecosystem, developers can develop security services based on the verification, data analysis engines, developer tools and many more. So we divide user security into three stages, right? So before the event, during the event and after the event, so which together is a complete user security lifecycle. So these services that are developed in the SEC wire ecosystem will cover the entire user security lifecycle.
03:05:27.196 - 03:06:07.532, Speaker A: So for example, risk detection before the event, like transaction simulation, firewalls onchain monitoring during the event and assess tracking and insurance after the event. So also we have launched a security ecosystem market as a platform for stackware aggregating security applications and services for users, developers and project parties. So we all understand that there's no absolute security and the scammers will always be there.
03:06:07.532 - 03:06:37.830, Speaker A: So let's keep building security awareness, developing the technology and implementing education to increase scam barriers and the cost, right? So one day when the cost of scams activity always the potential gain on an average scale, so maybe that day we can see a significant reduction in scams. And I'm hoping a good security ecosystem can lead us there. Okay, thank you.
03:06:37.830 - 03:06:49.588, Speaker A: Thanks, Dan. Yeah. And now it's lunchtime.
03:06:49.588 - 03:07:04.792, Speaker A: Like, we provide lunch in the base floor and in the tea session. And in the afternoon, we have four panels talking about CK, social Gaming and D Five. And also we have two speakers, quintas from Flashboss and Sharin from Eigen Layer.

04:02:12.134 - 04:02:27.342, Speaker A: And we also have Quintas from Bashbots and Sharing from Eigen Layer for the keynote presentations. Now I'm going to introduce all the guests on the panel. We have James from Figment Capital as the moderator.
04:02:27.342 - 04:02:42.642, Speaker A: And we have Victor from Manta, Sinka from Delphinis Labs, carting from Hyper, oracle, Antonio from Polyhedral and Dongmo from Seller. Let's welcome. And now I'm going to head my mic to James.
04:02:42.642 - 04:02:46.760, Speaker A: Like, James is your stage now. Okay? Thank you. Okay.
04:02:46.760 - 04:02:49.880, Speaker A: All right. Hi everybody. So.
04:02:49.880 - 04:02:55.980, Speaker A: Thank you, Grace. Like, Grace just mentioned number one. Thank you, seven X for having us here.
04:02:55.980 - 04:03:04.134, Speaker A: Very cool venue, great lunch. And then also, my name is Jim. I'm the managing partner at Figment Capital.
04:03:04.134 - 04:03:12.666, Speaker A: We're early stage blockchain fund. But really this is not about what we do. It's about what these guys do up here and the teams and what they're building in ZK.
04:03:12.666 - 04:03:27.906, Speaker A: And so what I'd like to do just first, really quickly, if you guys could introduce yourselves, maybe just like a couple of lines about what you're building, what your team name is, and then we could take it away with a couple of questions, a couple of hard hitting questions. Start from take it away, Victor. Yeah.
04:03:27.906 - 04:03:32.070, Speaker A: Okay. Hi everyone. I'm Victor from Manta network.
04:03:32.070 - 04:03:56.314, Speaker A: Manta is like right now, it's a layer two built on top of Ethereum, and it's using Opstack, and it's the first one used last DA. And on top of it we have universal Circuit, which is really unique, enables solidity developer build new use cases. Like without know anything about cryptography.
04:03:56.314 - 04:04:18.786, Speaker A: They can just call contract and build some decay applications. Yeah, I think right now, recently we just launched a minet, and it's actually yesterday, and our testnet has been running two months and there's like 200,000 address and 4 million transactions. Yeah, that's something about the project and about myself.
04:04:18.786 - 04:04:39.740, Speaker A: I start crypto in 2016 and doing investment, and I find ZK is kind of the future in 2020 and start working on that. Start from privacy DeFi and keep working on more use cases on the ZK space and create this platform for all of the ZK application. Thank you.
04:04:39.740 - 04:04:51.786, Speaker A: Awesome. Hi everyone, I'm Antonio from Polyhedral Network. Polyhedra builds the infrastructure for web three interoperability using zero knowledge proof techniques.
04:04:51.786 - 04:05:24.726, Speaker A: One thing we are building and promoting, which is largely adopted by a lot of our partners and projects, is the ZK Bridge, which offers trustless and efficient cross chain interoperability protocol for all projects, for data transfer, for asset transfer, and for general message parsing. So about me I started in around 2018 when we were still at school. We were a group of ZKP researchers when we talked about the idea of ZK Bridge and also optimizing the algorithm layer of the ZKP protocols.
04:05:24.726 - 04:05:34.694, Speaker A: Then later we founded Polyhedra Network and here we are. Thank you. Hi everyone, I'm Carton from Hyperoracle.
04:05:34.694 - 04:05:54.820, Speaker A: So hyper oracle is a programmable. ZK oracle protocol. So ZK Oracle can enable smart contract for more computation like complex compute, like Statistic Compute and AI compute, and also will enable more data source for your smart contract to bring the smart contract to another level.
04:05:54.820 - 04:06:21.290, Speaker A: Hi. This is Shinka from Daphne Slab. We are actually building solutions that people can run their WebAssembly bytecode in our virtual machine so that it does not only give you a result, but also gives you a CK proof which actually can help the browser application to leverage the CK technique and connect browse applications with web three applications.
04:06:21.290 - 04:06:39.838, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Mo from Satter. Satter is one of the biggest interoperability protocol for blockchain today, and some of you probably used the seabridge before. We processed about $15 billion transaction volume in the last year across 40 different blockchains.
04:06:39.838 - 04:06:56.326, Speaker A: And more recently we ventured into the ZK space, introducing a new initiative called Previous, which is a ZK coprocessor enabling smart contract to have new kind of capability for heavy and data rich computations. Awesome. Cool.
04:06:56.326 - 04:07:28.702, Speaker A: Great to meet all you guys. So I guess number yeah, maybe talking we'll start with Seller Mo, because when you look on the websites of all the projects that are building here right now, seller is the one that doesn't have a whole lot about ZK just yet. So maybe do you mind talking a little bit about what you're moving into with ZK and how the technology is kind of like enhancing the offerings that Seller is going to provide to applications as well as users? Yeah, sure.
04:07:28.702 - 04:07:52.938, Speaker A: So Seller was a project that was founded by Fuefront starting in 2018. And we started to work on layers of scalability, actually back in the days focusing on state channels. And over years, the entire state channel stack naturally morphed into blockchain interoperability and Setter is continuously evolving over the years.
04:07:52.938 - 04:08:28.638, Speaker A: And we were also looking at initially the ZK Bridge to enable ZK capability for the interoperability stack of Satter. But very quickly we find out that we start to realize that the entire scope of decay co processing is much bigger than just a Bridging. And therefore, for example, like today, if you look at the most simple example is if you look at Uniswap, if you look at PancakeSwap, what's the difference between these DEXes versus some of the centralized exchanges? One of the biggest difference there is that there's no VIP program, VIP trader programs in these DAXes.
04:08:28.638 - 04:08:48.358, Speaker A: Why is that? Right. Because blockchains and smart contracts fundamentally are very bad at data rich computations. For example, if you really want to implement some sort of a VIP trader program in these taxes, you kind of need to do accounting for every single trader, while only 5% of the total traders are actually VIP traders.
04:08:48.358 - 04:09:36.794, Speaker A: Or you do on chain direct proof of transaction inclusion using block headers, which is extremely expensive even for the small portion of users you want to kind of incentivize and do user retention on. So this is where we feel that this kind of a data reach and the heavy computation capability is missing in the blockchain space today. And therefore reintroducing bravius and to expand the initial scope of ZK Bridging to a more generalized data analysis capability and data injection and processing capability where for any kind of VIP traders the VIP trader can easily generate a proof decay proof stating that I have traded maybe $30 million in the last months on uniswap and then get a VIP status in a very cost efficient way.
04:09:36.794 - 04:09:49.326, Speaker A: The application scenario for this is very broad. You can actually do a lot more things for gaming, for social and so on and so forth. So this is how we kind of morphed into kind of this new initiative, basically.
04:09:49.326 - 04:10:11.714, Speaker A: Very cool. So about proving maybe certain activity or that you've done something or performed some sort of activity over a given life or a period and then rewarding those users retroactively kind of for the activity that they've participated in, which is sort of something that we see a lot in web two and in gaming and stuff like that. So it's pretty interesting and in trading maybe a little bit as well.
04:10:11.714 - 04:10:28.314, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So I'm going to kind of jump into a couple of questions we have here. As I'm sure a lot of you all know, I don't know what the ZK expertise is in the audience, but over the last, I would say like twelve months or so, we've seen a real big excitement for ZK technology, just more broadly in the crypto space.
04:10:28.314 - 04:10:43.546, Speaker A: We heard a little bit about token security on one of the speakers before, but there's also like cryptographic security, right, which is pretty cool. And as a result of that, there's been a lot of investment into ZK teams. A lot of you guys have either raised or announced raises really recently.
04:10:43.546 - 04:11:23.820, Speaker A: So congratulations on that. But I guess the one question that I have is sometimes people ask how far along in the future is ZK? Is it moon math? Is it way in the future or is it coming soon? And so I guess the first question I would ask is when you're building a ZK project, how do you balance the need to bring the product to market quickly to maybe service some needs that are needed right now with taking the time to ensure the security of your protocols and specifically ZK circuits. But more broadly, how do you balance those two things? Victor, do you want to go first? Yeah, sure.
04:11:23.820 - 04:11:40.770, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is really interesting question. From my perspective, I think there's really different direction right now on ZK space. One side goes to extremely research focus.
04:11:40.770 - 04:12:43.350, Speaker A: It's based on the assumption like what if the Zke application or Zkevm already have massive adoption, which even more adoption than existing ethereum and what kind of acceleration you need, what kind of proof aggregation you need, what kind of everything you need. That's kind of the direction I think on the research side it's kind of needed, but I think in the next five years or next ten years can achieve this kind of adoption. But on the other side I think some other project just really try really hard to find really early users to really use ZK application or ZK use cases like Bridge, even Zke EVM or all of these new use cases like maybe existing use cases, but it actually includes ZK compared to before.
04:12:43.350 - 04:13:21.298, Speaker A: So in this kind of case, this direction is actually need this kind of project work really hard and acquire user really aggressively most of the time. Talking the concept doesn't work, talking the backer doesn't work. It's just build a real product and you need to have interface same as other web two UX same as web two at least existing web three product or also the performance like same as the existing product.
04:13:21.298 - 04:14:14.370, Speaker A: That's actually really hard because it takes a lot of commutation. But I think we try really hard on this area. I think sometime if you try to get adoption, try to do liquoration really fast, there are kind of a balance between decentralized and about to make everything using ZK or like how's the end game endgame and basically the current use case to face the yeah, and I guess, Antonio, I want to ask you as well, because I know we spoke a little bit earlier last year and it sounds like Polyhydra's done, like, has built a bunch of stuff in ZK technology.
04:14:14.370 - 04:14:51.546, Speaker A: So what is your thought on how to build responsibly but also securely and also getting products to market that people can play with use and try to find that product market fit? Yeah, I love a saying that Menta is always saying because Kenny is also always saying there's no other industries focused on infrastructure so much as we do. There are so many infrastructures in the market and sometimes people say there are probably more infrastructures than applications in the market. So it occurs to us to polyhedra that well, we build infrastructures.
04:14:51.546 - 04:15:18.246, Speaker A: We were a group of researchers initially, but it occurs to us that by the end of the day only the infrastructures with massive adoptions would be able to survive because there are too many there. Eventually infrastructures need to be used by applications and we need end users. Well, as Victor was saying, we are not getting users by promoting our technology.
04:15:18.246 - 04:15:36.662, Speaker A: We are not getting users by telling them hey, who are backing us? We are getting to the users by actually proving to them that how easily and how good our product is. And that's what we are focusing on. For example, because you're saying how long we are on the journey of ZK.
04:15:36.662 - 04:15:44.046, Speaker A: Well, I would say we are just getting started, but we started maybe several years ago. So we do have something. So we are on our way.
04:15:44.046 - 04:16:13.554, Speaker A: One thing about Zkbridge is that well, people may think ZK is slow, it might be expensive in terms of onchain cost, but actually when you are indeed using ZK bridge you will find that ZK bridge is actually super fast. Our finality for making proofs well, the making proofs for simple consensus like Binance smart chain could be 0.1 second and even for full consensus of Ethereum, we're able to do that within 8 seconds.
04:16:13.554 - 04:16:23.290, Speaker A: So the finality could be like the total finality including like on chain confirmation could be several, well, maybe 30 seconds. So that's one thing we are doing. I think we are doing great.
04:16:23.290 - 04:16:47.490, Speaker A: We had over 9 million transactions over the past five months, so roughly a million and a half every month and we are already having over a million and million something active addresses using Zkbridge already. What do those transactions look like? I'm curious, do you have any sort of double click into the types of transactions? Yeah, we do. We actually do.
04:16:47.490 - 04:17:00.018, Speaker A: So we know it's in the bear market. We still have to admit that in the bear market well, in the bear market people tend to hold but not trade. So actually a lot of transactions are coming from NFT sector.
04:17:00.018 - 04:17:25.502, Speaker A: That's one sector we're aiming at because well, if you look through the history, when there's depression, people focus on games, entertainment like NFTs. So we're focusing on the NFT field. We are helping NFTs and games and Metaverse make them across different chains because in the bear market we have fewer users than in the bull market.
04:17:25.502 - 04:17:34.878, Speaker A: So it's especially important for projects to attract users from all different blockchains. And that's what we do. That's one thing we provide for our partners.
04:17:34.878 - 04:17:58.298, Speaker A: We help them to create a MultiChain setting where they're able to attract users on all different chains and users are able to easily move their assets, move their information, move their data around. So no matter which chain you started with, you can always use any of the applications powered by Zkbridge on any chains. And that's also the user integration in the NFT field.
04:17:58.298 - 04:18:18.786, Speaker A: So that's the strategy we're taking in the down market and it turns out to work very well. And you mentioned that we've got a bunch of infrastructure builders up here, so maybe talking a little bit about the infrastructure of some of the teams. So, Carton, you're building Hyper Oracle, you're looking for fast, you're looking for high performance, maybe.
04:18:18.786 - 04:18:34.614, Speaker A: Can you talk a little bit about your infrastructure stack and what you're I believe you're moving towards Asics as quickly as possible, right? Yeah, doing Asics like one of the options. But right now we're thinking more practically it's utilized bunch GPU in the market right now. Right.
04:18:34.614 - 04:18:59.310, Speaker A: So back to the topic about how to make the ZK DAP that can more accessible for people. I think this problem should separate into two parts. The first part is how to let developer develop Zkdap overnight, right? Because right now, normally it takes a PhD two to three months to learn about DSL to program a ZK circuit that's safe.
04:18:59.310 - 04:19:39.270, Speaker A: I think the cost for develop a ZK that is still very high at this moment. So in Hyper Oracle, what we do is that we try to simplify the process to develop a ZK DAP by enable using the custom logic, right, by assembly script. And then people can just like developer can just ride the ZK DAP without knowing zero knowledge proof and then compile the assembly script into the ZK warsum and then generate the proof for the custom compute and also use the circuit we made for the statistician.
04:19:39.270 - 04:20:10.622, Speaker A: And that's the first part to make the process to make a ZK DAP is as easy as possible. And then the second part is like this ZK industry is so big, so we need more cooperation to have more function into the system. And in ZK Oracle system, we're glad to have polyhedra and have Daphness Zkwasm to empower some usage that is just really hard for one project to achieve.
04:20:10.622 - 04:20:21.560, Speaker A: And so I think it's a really open space. Everybody's, the majority of them are open source. And so by combining these two factor, we can make Zkdap become really wild really soon.
04:20:21.560 - 04:20:30.042, Speaker A: Very cool. And then for Dell finish labs. You guys are building Gkwasm, right? Yeah.
04:20:30.042 - 04:20:44.414, Speaker A: When we actually start building blockchain applications, we find actually fascinating about the idea that code, it's a law, but to be more precisely, it's the code running in the Easter room. It's the law. Right.
04:20:44.414 - 04:21:08.966, Speaker A: So when we're actually trying to expanding the idea of the definition of code, we would like to have some code running out of the Isram to be the law as well. Right. And we started with doing something called CK, like JavaScript, right, where and we somehow failed because dynamic language does have some kind of feature like closure that it's not very.
04:21:08.966 - 04:21:35.950, Speaker A: Easy to compile to CK circuits. And after that we tried the idea about actually run and design CK virtual machine that supports WebAssembly and that actually works out pretty well. And I would like this virtual machine to serve as like a Python style in the CK world because Python is not that quick but it actually glues lots of other components.
04:21:35.950 - 04:21:58.134, Speaker A: And this is our approach. We write a virtual machine that actually can be easily extend to connect other CK system and CK proofs so that people can using us as a glue in their CK solutions and bring fast adoption for the programs to leverage CK. Thanks.
04:21:58.134 - 04:22:24.558, Speaker A: Very cool. And so I'm going to change the questions up a little bit. What do you guys think about the recent proposals to augment ZK roll ups security by using Tees trusted execution environments for two factor authentication? Maybe first, if anybody wants to explain what I just said, that would maybe be helpful or I'm happy to do it.
04:22:24.558 - 04:22:51.850, Speaker A: But you guys are the speakers, so does someone want to take a stab? Yeah, I can give a brief explanation for that. So basically the idea here is that you have Zeke Rob and you have prover that generating proofs. What happens if a prover or circuit has issues and therefore you generate either wrong proofs that can kind of settle into wrong states and therefore still basically users money eventually.
04:22:51.850 - 04:23:20.546, Speaker A: And the idea is that, okay, how about we just augment an additional layer of trust execution environment and put all the block production logic into that execution environment? And basically we only kind of confirm or finalize the block on chain when two sources matches. One is a ZK proof and the other is a te based execution environment. So that's kind of the premises of this.
04:23:20.546 - 04:23:51.850, Speaker A: I think in general this is very valuable. First of all and coming back to the question, you just mentioned basically about security and adoption and kind of a launching project into public. There are just so many kind of security preparations you can do before launch, right? So Te is one and the other is of course audit, a lot of audits and I know a lot of folks here spend a lot of money on this, me included.
04:23:51.850 - 04:24:22.854, Speaker A: But what we have been championing in the community and we have been building bridge which is the most targeted space for DeFi hacks to date. And we have been targeted in all round like in all angles that you can imagine in the past. So one thing that we have been championing in the community is to build your application or infrastructure stack in a prismatic way that is very important.
04:24:22.854 - 04:25:00.254, Speaker A: So it used to be the case that we do audits upfront and we launch the protocol into the wild and just cross our fingers and hope for the best. And that doesn't work actually. Right? So we have seen this time again and again bugs get discovered like half year into the protocol running on mainnet and therefore we believe that for any protocols or any infrastructures or any application to launch in the wild there should be built in defensive mechanisms like circuit breakers, like kind of a bridge invariant checkers.
04:25:00.254 - 04:25:50.210, Speaker A: For example, all the JK row apps should have probably already have invariant checkers. Basically saying that if there are some tokens burned on the VM side, on the layer two side, the matching amount tokens should get released on the layer one side and continuously monitoring that, right? So this kind of a continuous monitoring and defensive mechanism that is built in into the application from day one is very important to have a smooth launch in the sense that even if there are something that get missed in the auditing process or in the kind of internal review process, the worst case losses are always bonded. So that's something that I think we are kind of championing in the Bridging space seeing so many kind of different hacks and also kind of generally to the blockchain community.
04:25:50.210 - 04:26:21.450, Speaker A: Awesome. I feel like victor, I feel like you have something to say about this. Yeah, I just feel this is really interesting question because in the beginning mean at first I totally agree what I think this is only square doing this right? And basically I totally agree this is to find a more practical approach to get adoption and launch as soon as possible.
04:26:21.450 - 04:26:49.250, Speaker A: But I think at the same time in long term we need to understand all of the te is like a black box and with it get more and more decentralized. It's actually not secure so there's some risk on top of it. And also scroll is a Zke EVM so it finally should goes to ZK.
04:26:49.250 - 04:27:17.920, Speaker A: But in the beginning, the MultiPro I think like I can't hear to judge because we are actually using op, like not using fancy zkvm. But we do research on multi proverb at the time and I do think this is work. But I think for us, ZK Prover is actually like a backup plan.
04:27:17.920 - 04:27:41.490, Speaker A: Because most of the ZK Proverbs and haven't been running for a while yet. But definitely I think multiprover is kind of a good solution right now. It's essentially a multi prover, right? Which is like because you're essentially verifying that the circuit ran it the same as the EVM would have otherwise.
04:27:41.490 - 04:28:15.070, Speaker A: Sorry, right you're running it as if the EVM would have run it, you would have come up with the same solution and running the question two different ways. The issue two different I mean I can't disclose too much, but it seems under research okay, still under research you said like multipruvers we've heard a lot about ZK technology and that it kind of like mathematically is secure and so we're in a crypto conference. Crypto conferences are all about decentralization.
04:28:15.070 - 04:28:45.660, Speaker A: We're decentralizing the validators, we're decentralizing the node operators. There's been some discussion about whether or not you need to always have decentralization when it comes to ZK technology. So from an infrastructure point of view, where does decentralization make sense in your guys ZK protocols and what does it help to actually guarantee? So guys, I'll start with a question.
04:28:45.660 - 04:29:03.562, Speaker A: So for us, we were talking about multi prover. So that's actually one very good start point for decentralization, especially in the ZK prover system. Well, it used to be very hard for ZKS to be decentralized or even to be paralleled.
04:29:03.562 - 04:29:22.482, Speaker A: One thing why we came up with Zkbridge, why that paper was got selected by the committee, was that we invented an algorithm that first time in history ever we're able to parallel compute ZK algorithms. Well, it's actually more than parallel. We call it distribute.
04:29:22.482 - 04:29:43.178, Speaker A: But the difference between distributed and parallel is that for parallel computing, you have multiple machines at the same place, so they communicate with each other. You can have that in one environment with a large memory, like several hundred gigabytes of memory. Basically they can pass information with each other quite often.
04:29:43.178 - 04:29:59.022, Speaker A: So that's parallel computing. But based on that we are actually able to do distributed computing for ZK proofs. We are able to have the machines distributed even in different corners of the world where they are able to communicate.
04:29:59.022 - 04:30:24.886, Speaker A: Laconically, I think that's a Latin word or Italian word laconic, it means silence. So there's minimum communication required between all these nodes so that we can actually make a decentralized proof system where we're able to make the proof generation process scattered into all different machines around the world. And thus we're able to even accelerate the proof generation speed.
04:30:24.886 - 04:30:42.590, Speaker A: Because imagine in the past can only do one core CPU, now we can do like 64 core CPU generating proof at the same time as well as decentralized distributed generating the proof at the same time. So that's the breakthrough ZK bridges bring. And that's why we are able to make such an efficient algorithm.
04:30:42.590 - 04:31:02.254, Speaker A: Actually like a really interesting idea here because you talk about how to have a ZK and te as a sequencer. How about have an op inside too? So we got like triple authentication. It's just a kind of joke.
04:31:02.254 - 04:31:11.570, Speaker A: Okay. Decentralization is I think it's the core value for crypto industry. The reason why we use Bitcoin is just because it's decentralized.
04:31:11.570 - 04:31:24.160, Speaker A: Actually with building a ZK Oracle, I care about decentralization the most actually compared with efficiency. So that's why we proposed a new idea. It's called the proof of oracle work.
04:31:24.160 - 04:31:41.330, Speaker A: It's kind of like POW. But instead of generating consensus for the network, we generate the liveness for this intent compute network. So we have the agent that perform the zero knowledge proof, op fraud proof or whatever proof to the smart contract.
04:31:41.330 - 04:32:32.020, Speaker A: But how we ensure this network is alive when the smart contract need that? So how about we have an incentive wide mechanism there we put down some token reward in the Ethereum, because Ethereum is really decentralized, right? And then whoever can submit the proof first, who got that? So by this way you can have a new kind of mechanism here that generate a liveness for the Oracle and do not break a decentralization and make the whole thing fully decentralized. Can I push back on or can I ask you a follow up question to that one? You carton, is that a proof race? Proof what, like a proof race? Yeah, kind of like that. Whoever do it first, who will just take the reward, right? Yeah.
04:32:32.020 - 04:33:04.140, Speaker A: But we don't need to worry about the winner take all because even the strong proverb they can only run one task at one block, right? They cannot just run all the tasks and still be the first one. There you go. Okay, actually you front ran my question, which was like in a proof race, which is like that we all start at the same spot and we all run to create the race, the proof at the same time, doesn't it ultimately lead to a winner take all? Because if I'm the best at proving, then ultimately I will win every single time that I compete, every time that I go for a run.
04:33:04.140 - 04:33:39.270, Speaker A: I guess in your case, what you're imagining is that there's so many proofs that are running all at the same time in the future, right? One Ethereum block might have millions of the ZK proof got submitting to, so I don't worry about the miner. The approver have nothing to do because they have a really bad machine, because there's always some task for them, just some simple the one is simpler. And what they need to do is find out the position among the whole system, what's the ranking for computation resources.
04:33:39.270 - 04:34:30.958, Speaker A: Victor, how important is it in your protocol? I was thinking maybe want to add something more, but from our side we just do really practical way, we just think start from beginning, we try to do it on the application level, decentralized, and then the infrastructure goes better and better and we don't have to reinvent the wheel. Start from beginning, do it again. But from my perspective, I will expect some games, some credentials to actually release.
04:34:30.958 - 04:35:05.140, Speaker A: And actually from user perspective, they use all of these things without centralized server running on the back end. It's actually really hard for applications without server, without even mean, without even centralized Oracle, but not, you know, that's actually really hard. How about yourself? Since we are actually doing tooling about a virtual machine, we do not have a plan for decentralization at the moment.
04:35:05.140 - 04:35:14.902, Speaker A: It's open source. It's like decentralized automatically. Yeah.
04:35:14.902 - 04:35:41.898, Speaker A: So for decentralization traditionally in blockchain really brings two value. One security, the other is censorship, resistance. I think in the ZK context things are a little bit slightly different in the sense that in most of the decade protocols like ZK row apps, decade coprocessor like us, the security side of things are actually guaranteed by the cryptographic theory of zero nudge proofs.
04:35:41.898 - 04:36:21.878, Speaker A: There is 00:16 proofs but still in many cases the reason that people are talking about decentralization in ZK, for example, shared provers for ZK row apps are because they still want to maintain the trust freeness, sorry, the extensorship resistance side of this. But for many other ZK protocols, one additional benefit that are brought by decentralization is actually efficiency. So for ZK coprocessors like us, we often deal with repeated structured computation across large range of blocks, across large sum of transactions or large set of signatures.
04:36:21.878 - 04:36:45.154, Speaker A: So in these kind of scenarios, decentralization is essentially kind of morphed into distributed computing naturally and parallel computing in general. So this is where we are also kind of putting a lot of effort on to make the entire decade coprocessor stack more efficient. So this is something that I guess added value for decentralization in the ZK space.
04:36:45.154 - 04:36:49.780, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you guys so much. So we are running out of time, I think we're probably out of time.
04:36:49.780 - 04:37:04.774, Speaker A: I want to throw out a really interesting question. I just remind you actually have four kind of way to do it. Fhe plus ZK plus Te plus Op authentication that will be the ultimate rollout right, ultimate roll up.
04:37:04.774 - 04:37:30.034, Speaker A: So we have zero time left. So I guess the one thing I was just going to ask really quickly is is there a paper or something that you've read in the last month that you highly recommend to the group that they check out from my side? Yeah, I actually didn't do any paper research these days. Please read the PNS paper we just published last month.
04:37:30.034 - 04:37:46.802, Speaker A: It was selected by IEEE Security committee. It's published on Twitter and also our website. It's called Plunk via unlimited distribution, basically we're able to make a distributed version of Plunk which can be used for decentralized proof market decentralized proof generation.
04:37:46.802 - 04:38:06.934, Speaker A: Distributed proof generation. Yeah, I want to say that one, but you already mentioned it and so I just promote another paper. It's really interesting that's called interactive zoom out proof that built by Pedal Lab and it's like really interesting idea because normally we want non interatid but they made an interactive one and actually it's like different purpose.
04:38:06.934 - 04:38:30.100, Speaker A: It's not for secure robot but it's for cool thing. I probably recommend an old paper that published by Polyhydra co founders and it's the divergo proving scheme, right? It's a pretty good one and worth actually understanding and analyzing the tricks that have been. Thank you.
04:38:30.100 - 04:38:44.102, Speaker A: Well, there are a bunch of interesting research that is coming out recently. Like Lasso is something that we're looking at and also like many of the research papers that you guys mentioned, we're also looking at it. But yeah, decay is very fast moving space.
04:38:44.102 - 04:38:48.378, Speaker A: So definitely kind of keep tap on that. Okay, awesome. And with that we're done.
04:38:48.378 - 04:38:55.354, Speaker A: Thank you everybody for being so attentive. And thank you, seven x. Thank you Jen, for moderating this panel.
04:38:55.354 - 04:39:02.222, Speaker A: And thank you all our CK panelists. And our next panel is about social. So the moderator is from seven.
04:39:02.222 - 04:39:13.266, Speaker A: X is lavender. And we have five social panelists. Suji from Mask, wilson from Cyber Connect, troy from Radon, kevin from Lifeform, and Jaden from Click.
04:39:13.266 - 04:39:24.250, Speaker A: So if you're interested in social now, it's go time. Yeah. Let's give a warm welcome to all our panelists to come on the stage.
04:39:24.250 - 04:40:11.912, Speaker A: Hi everyone. My name is Levenger investment Director of Seven Extentures. Today we have like five very cherished and expert in the Web Three social space.
04:40:11.912 - 04:40:32.530, Speaker A: Very honored that we can invite them to attend this speech and share the insights. Social has been a very interesting topic most recently due to what has happened to friend tech. And the transaction volume has been amazing.
04:40:32.530 - 04:40:53.620, Speaker A: And these are all the pioneers, entrepreneurs and insiders in the space. So that's why we try to get them together and share more insights with all of us. So we welcome them and I will let them introduce themselves from Wilson.
04:40:53.620 - 04:41:00.090, Speaker A: Hello everyone, glad to be here. I'm Wilson Wei. I'm the co founder of Cyber Connect.
04:41:00.090 - 04:41:16.950, Speaker A: We're building a decentralized social network starting from providing the first ever aggregated account abstractions for login sign up. Yeah. Hi everyone.
04:41:16.950 - 04:41:27.194, Speaker A: My name is Troy, the co founder, Redone. We are building the infrastructure for the content layer of Web Three. And people probably know us more as a mobile app.
04:41:27.194 - 04:41:31.100, Speaker A: We're building a web. Three Aggregator. Mobile app? Yes.
04:41:31.100 - 04:41:45.290, Speaker A: Hello, Suji. From Mass Network. We've been doing decentralized social network since 2017.
04:41:45.290 - 04:41:57.230, Speaker A: It's like a long journal. Six years. And in 2021 we launched our token and start to systematically helping funding granting the more decentralized social landscape.
04:41:57.230 - 04:42:18.120, Speaker A: I think the future will be like 100 different social protocol. It will be boring if there's only like five social protocol, but it's also going to be like a compatible inter exchangeable feature that everyone can talk through different protocols. So we are kind of like building a bridge between the Web Three protocols and the web Two to Web Three.
04:42:18.120 - 04:42:27.240, Speaker A: Hello everyone. This is Kevin from lifeform. We are aiming to bring next billion users onboarding Web Three.
04:42:27.240 - 04:42:34.378, Speaker A: Really thrilling to meet all your guys here. Hope you enjoy your time. Hi guys.
04:42:34.378 - 04:42:45.614, Speaker A: My name is Jaden. At Clique we built these new primitives we call Identity Oracles. And the idea is you're able to seamlessly pull web Two user behavior data in a privacy preserving way.
04:42:45.614 - 04:42:59.682, Speaker A: So, for example, I could prove you have at least 1000 followers on Twitter. You generate this many impressions, we push that data on chain and then you can create that value or use your existing social graph in your new Web Three social apps. Great.
04:42:59.682 - 04:43:14.578, Speaker A: Thanks for all the introductions. And I would love to start with Jaden probably because the Maya there. So today we will be discussing about why social need to be decentralized.
04:43:14.578 - 04:43:48.574, Speaker A: And I will start with the first question, which is what the key problem that you see in the traditional web two space? Social can be solved by using blockchain technology and what benefit that decentralization brings to social? Yeah, that's a great question. So I think from our perspective, one of the largest problems in web two is you have a lot of these different data silos right across different social platforms. Your Facebook owns your data with Facebook platforms, Google with Google platforms, so on and so forth.
04:43:48.574 - 04:44:20.758, Speaker A: And you're not able to interoperably and composably, share and use that data, which is the main problem we actually aim to solve, right, which is as a user now you can claim your YouTube data, Twitter data, Google Analytics data, chat, GPT data, you can store that with you as a value store in your wallet. From there you're able to push it onto any blockchain, any protocol can then take that data and do compute on top of it. Which means that in the future what you're going to see is you're going to be able to build significantly more sophisticated business use cases.
04:44:20.758 - 04:44:52.624, Speaker A: Today Facebook owns your data, they use it for Facebook ads, but actually a ton more can be done with that data. Right, but those use cases are not possible because you don't have a privacy preserving composable and interoperable design, which blockchains probably like Kevin from. Oh yeah, I agree with Jaden's idea besides about this.
04:44:52.624 - 04:45:31.720, Speaker A: Also, I think that privacy and security also is a very big issue and also maybe a very huge improvement, which can web three be done? And web two data from my side, I used to work in tensor boards. We have faced a problem like when you do some discussion on the centralized platform, when you have some debate or you have some pros and cons, you have the power to shut down all the debate and say, okay, we shut down this and we give you a lose to some part. But actually in the web three part, I think it's a value network.
04:45:31.720 - 04:45:47.810, Speaker A: So if you have some debate or you have some social issue, you can use some web three power to leverage it and make it maybe more privacy and more security. It'd be great. Okay, got it.
04:45:47.810 - 04:46:03.060, Speaker A: I think if decentralized social network is working, I mean, people don't really want to switch to decentralized one. But the problem is the centralized social network is not working. The people's interaction activity is not bounded by nation border.
04:46:03.060 - 04:46:39.472, Speaker A: You can have foreign friend, you can have many friends, you have friends from even like alien friend, like boss friend, AI friend, right? But right now the centralized social network basically limited the every social network. Have a base, have a home base like rooted in a nation, state, country, and eventually it will intervene in the social network, stop people forming different kind of groups, political party and use all the means to prevent them to grow naturally. I think that's the time those platforms will eventually trade off.
04:46:39.472 - 04:46:51.824, Speaker A: They say oh we have to go IPO, we have to earn money. So we do listen to the nation state government and we do close some functionalities. For example, you cannot really even Twitter have the tip functionality.
04:46:51.824 - 04:47:11.788, Speaker A: You cannot really tip any user from any other country. You have to go through the KYC process and even most of the social network they do have the capability to have anonymous users but you have to have your cell phone to log in that enforce some kind of KYC. I think that's a problem.
04:47:11.788 - 04:47:46.884, Speaker A: It's not because of the technology need to be 100% decentralized, it's just saying that the regulator and nation state government is chasing relentlessly that we have run away from them into a shelter using the decentralized technology they cannot infiltrate. That's a place that eventually we can have our own unique innovation and the innovations like those blueprint already out there. We already have the idea of how Twitter can be decentralized, how WeChat can be decentralized just within the old boundary.
04:47:46.884 - 04:47:51.528, Speaker A: You cannot do that. So I think that's why we need decentralized ones. Got it.
04:47:51.528 - 04:48:36.570, Speaker A: I completely agree. I'm a firm believer of full decentralization but there is still a little bit debate of whether because you just mentioned like KYC kind of stuff which also is going on to be a big hurdle for decentralized social network then how you see probably the growth pass or the legislation attitude towards those decentralized social apps or you think it's not there yet. It's probably like maybe like three years later or five years later that we talk about it.
04:48:36.570 - 04:48:54.824, Speaker A: I think it's going to be very tough question. Honestly in the whole industry, the whole crypto westri whatever industry we refer the cyberspace as a new continent. We always say that oh we took the mayflower we sell to the new continent.
04:48:54.824 - 04:49:32.360, Speaker A: Well that's always but if you really look into the historical comparison here the American funding father don't really have the freedom by granted it's tough revolution, right involving many different parties, involving them in different powers. For example we always think like there's several really great privacy preserving centralized social network based in the US. For example like signal right? But again signal have to use your mobile phone, it's Siame KYC.
04:49:32.360 - 04:49:43.064, Speaker A: There's more active user from Asia. There's more active user from Asia. They're using all different kind of telegram these kind of cool social networks.
04:49:43.064 - 04:50:02.028, Speaker A: It feels like when the American get independent the royal France is fighting with the British empire and they don't like each other. And what happened is the royal friends send money and troops to help the American get independence. I think that's what happened in Hong Kong and Singapore.
04:50:02.028 - 04:50:09.508, Speaker A: I think a lot of people here not really say hey we're for the freedom. They say hey, we're for the money. We just hate the other part.
04:50:09.508 - 04:50:32.876, Speaker A: Then we send more engineers, basically troops in this field, and we start to build this thing and eventually get independence. I think one core factor, one core parameter is the percentage of the GDP that's happened in the cyberspace or percentage of conversation happened in the cyberspace, even. I have friends all over the country right now.
04:50:32.876 - 04:50:46.908, Speaker A: I think my personal favorite social network is Telegram and then Twitter. I think eventually you're going to change into a more decentralized one. I have no idea which one I'm going to win, but I'm probably going to be multiple winner.
04:50:46.908 - 04:51:06.692, Speaker A: And that time all the transactions will be likely be done on that separate space, that social network, and then the capability of texting people will be basically given out by the nation state government. That time we can start to bargain. Right now there's nothing bargaining because like, oh, we're going to tax you, we're going to just pass a law.
04:51:06.692 - 04:51:14.516, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. Just make them feel painful. Say, hey, we lose huge tax ourselves, we lose a huge amount of billionaires.
04:51:14.516 - 04:51:22.092, Speaker A: They went to the new cyberspace. That's the time you can start to bargain. Say, oh, okay, what if you guys have a new law? We move back a little bit.
04:51:22.092 - 04:51:34.240, Speaker A: Yeah, by the time it's going to be a happy problem, right? Yeah. It can take many years, but this industry is only ten year old. Yeah, okay, agree.
04:51:34.240 - 04:51:39.648, Speaker A: Quite optimistic. Okay, got it. Yeah.
04:51:39.648 - 04:52:00.200, Speaker A: I want to add up from a little bit new perspective. I think content consumption or content delivery process or content curation process is a big problem in traditional social platforms. So traditional social network like Facebook or Twitter, they under the spotlight of manipulating fake news or manipulating how people seeing everything.
04:52:00.200 - 04:52:14.428, Speaker A: I read the article the other day, like Elon Musk was thinking about open source, the ranking algorithm on Twitter to explain to people why you're seeing this. And they were trying to make different versions of that. People can choose and tweak around that.
04:52:14.428 - 04:52:30.144, Speaker A: So there were some initiatives from him to doing that, but it doesn't actually work out. And I think that is probably he also thinks this is a big problem for Twitter as well. Try to solve why you're seeing this, but it's very difficult because the algorithm itself is a black box.
04:52:30.144 - 04:52:38.164, Speaker A: It's a core problem. And I think in web three, we can probably build something better here. There are two directions here I can think of.
04:52:38.164 - 04:52:49.944, Speaker A: First. One, we can build something like a ZK ranking, like a layer on that, and we can open source and using smart contract or ZK and computation nodes into that. So you can explain why you are seeing that.
04:52:49.944 - 04:53:03.036, Speaker A: All the computation can be explained, can be verified. A different solution is we don't use machine learning or this kind of black box solutions. We use our community to curate and pick the article you're seeing.
04:53:03.036 - 04:53:15.488, Speaker A: So we test it out on Readon. We're building a stake to vote like a tokenomics protocol, allow users to vote on content they like. And I think our community like that.
04:53:15.488 - 04:53:26.148, Speaker A: Right now, on a daily basis, thousands of users are voting on content they like and picking the list. You should read on a daily basis on different topics. Got it.
04:53:26.148 - 04:53:34.840, Speaker A: Maybe we can try it out. Okay, got it. So it's basically increase the user interaction.
04:53:34.840 - 04:53:57.470, Speaker A: Okay, got it. What key problems that you see in the traditional web? Two social can be solved by using blockchain technology. Yeah, I think they cover up pretty much everything.
04:53:57.470 - 04:54:51.200, Speaker A: Interoperability composability a little bit about regulation and how potentially a decentralized structure for collaboration could help to increase the overall efficiency of, for example, curating content or in another sense creating content. Right, so I think other than that, maybe from another two different angles. One, it's like how fundamentally it could be different when you have a distributed system essentially owned by a large group of users or creators or contributors to the platform, instead of a platform that is owned by a small group of people or corporation.
04:54:51.200 - 04:55:30.444, Speaker A: And I think Elon Musk is a very special case in a way that he's not trying to make money out of Twitter, which is not normal for any kind of business to run. And therefore we see a whole lot different policy and things that he did it in a way that it could be never imagined by any public or profit driven companies. But we couldn't use that one specific case to say, okay, we solved the problem of monopoly or things.
04:55:30.444 - 04:55:58.310, Speaker A: As long as we still have this long term conflict of interest between platform and users because of the platform have control over all those data and other users on it, and they have a conflict interest again, the user and the creators, they are trying to maximize their own profits. Ultimately the best thing to happen unless all the company, all the platforms are running nonprofits. Got it.
04:55:58.310 - 04:56:22.232, Speaker A: Thanks. You actually bring that up. It comes down to my next question, because you bring up like interoperability and composability is so important and people love saying about it in DeFi we can see that level of interoperability happens on the asset interoperability on different protocols, on different chains.
04:56:22.232 - 04:56:54.992, Speaker A: While in gaming we probably may foresee one game items in one game and that can be used as item b in the other game. So from your perspective, what kind of interoperability that you see in social, decentralized social and at what level? Well, a lot. And that's exactly why Cyber Connect came up with the first concept of decentralized social grab protocol.
04:56:54.992 - 04:57:25.280, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll give you a couple of examples. For example, if anyone here is familiar with login with WeChat nowadays, or login with Facebook like a decade ago, users are actually able to log in into different games. Or other social use cases using their existing established social graph like friends, the people they follow and also some of the status that they establish.
04:57:25.280 - 04:57:49.800, Speaker A: So bringing your friends to other use cases could be one very solid use case of interoperability. And also that could help the third party app to bootstrap so much better. And therefore it could provide the hope to break through this whole update that monopoly thing to actually create a much better environment for startups.
04:57:49.800 - 04:58:24.976, Speaker A: And some other example would be like reputations. For example, nowadays we saw a lot of fake profiles on Twitter, LinkedIn and people claiming who they're not and trying to scam people around. So if we have this on chain reputation system that people can actually track and verify everything they claim to be that status since it's on chain and it's living within your cyber account, when the next time you use your cyber account to log in into other apps, you don't have to somehow verify again and again.
04:58:24.976 - 04:58:38.890, Speaker A: You don't have to explain yourself for a thousand times and say okay, I'm the co founder of Cyber Connect, things like that. So those are the two. Very quick example, monetization would be number three, but I'll live it.
04:58:38.890 - 04:58:44.970, Speaker A: Okay. Probably give to Troy. Yeah.
04:58:44.970 - 04:58:56.620, Speaker A: So the question was yeah, the interpretability interoperability. Yeah. I think content is actually one good example.
04:58:56.620 - 04:59:19.824, Speaker A: For example, right now the norm is we post a tweet on Twitter, I post a photo on Instagram and so the content actually lived on this traditional platform. It's more like appendix or something like connected to my actions on this specific social networks. But I think probably a better norm is I post or create a content to a protocol.
04:59:19.824 - 04:59:30.392, Speaker A: Then I give accessibility control to different channels and they can choose to help me to promote to different channels. In that case, there are only one piece of content. I fully own the content.
04:59:30.392 - 04:59:53.436, Speaker A: The content doesn't belong to certain platforms. I think if we kind of have that norm, it's probably more fair to the content creator and there are a lot of things can happen, for example copyright or accessibility control or revenue models on accountant. This can be implemented based on the shared component of the content protocol.
04:59:53.436 - 05:00:06.308, Speaker A: Then different channels can use this kind of the shared component of that. So I think that is some kind of composability on the content layer that Redon would try to build. Got it.
05:00:06.308 - 05:00:36.716, Speaker A: But do you find like the ownership of certain contents? Users might think it quite important, like the owning a piece of content that I have on a social, decentralized social network. Do you think it's really important for the users? Yeah, I think the ownership of account is very different with ownership of assets. For example, accountant is only a piece of information.
05:00:36.716 - 05:00:54.770, Speaker A: Once account is public, it's already there, everybody knows it. You actually lose the ownership because content is not kind of a fixed or finite. Actually, there's no ownership of the content, we only have copyright something along that with the content.
05:00:54.770 - 05:01:15.012, Speaker A: Yesterday I was talking with Tom from team, they were building like what they call UDL, a universal data license protocol. So I think it's a super cool idea. And then we share some vision here and I think it will fit like what we try to build as giving accessibility control to your unique content, your unit.
05:01:15.012 - 05:01:27.932, Speaker A: So you have to specify the different terms you kind of apply to the use case of the content. So it's very different like NFT or other thing like just owning. Got it, got it.
05:01:27.932 - 05:01:46.900, Speaker A: So to suji, I mean, if we look top down, the largest social network out there is like Facebook and Twitter. If you count the Im Ying, it will be like Telegram, WeChat line Cacao WhatsApp? It's like another Facebook family thing. So that's going to be the web, two big ones.
05:01:46.900 - 05:02:05.284, Speaker A: Right? Then from that perspective, we look top down. The largest one is probably Madstown, like few million mau. Then Blue Sky support by Jet Dossi have around 800K user, but a lot of more potential.
05:02:05.284 - 05:02:26.204, Speaker A: And Master once reached like few million user and few million mau. But now it's a little bit in a problem with more trade off with centralization or user better UIUX. Then comes to the more decentralized one like Cyber connections, forecaster, et cetera, et cetera.
05:02:26.204 - 05:02:49.348, Speaker A: That's all about like several hundred K user, right? The funny thing is if you look all these relatively decentralized solution, they're not even compatible to each other. Like, okay, just tell a newbie, right? Tell a non crypto newbie, hey, get a wallet and this guy get a wallet, then just say, hey, tweet something, post something. Yeah, I post something on Oster.
05:02:49.348 - 05:03:10.936, Speaker A: Can you use Lance to reply me? No, because it's different key, but honestly, it's the same key, it's the same curve. Even the VIP standard for memory words, 24 words is same. The user gets like, oh, what is the same 24 word? But you can't reply me what happened? I think the problem is there's so many different internal fighting within the industry.
05:03:10.936 - 05:03:21.696, Speaker A: Everyone try to be, hey, I'm the decentralized trader, I'm the Facebook killer. Just like I remember 2018, there's like 20 ECM killer. Now they all switch to layer two, layer three.
05:03:21.696 - 05:03:32.692, Speaker A: I think the same thing can happen. No one really wants to kill Twitter as a public square. Maybe we want to kill Twitter as a private company that's doing some evil thing.
05:03:32.692 - 05:03:43.320, Speaker A: Maybe we want to kill Facebook because there's many censorship. I love you. Yeah, we should preserve the square, public square and then somehow connect everything on top of it.
05:03:43.320 - 05:03:56.444, Speaker A: So that's what we're doing. I think in the next five years, let's say maybe in the next bull run when semxuing another panel here. Everyone, we are a Facebook Twitter layer three.
05:03:56.444 - 05:04:04.320, Speaker A: I think that's better. Honestly, better. Like all the ethereum killers switch to the EVM compatible layer two, layer three, and they become a family.
05:04:04.320 - 05:04:08.610, Speaker A: I think that's better. Now it's like people don't talk to each other. That's the best thing.
05:04:08.610 - 05:04:40.588, Speaker A: I think if that problem didn't solve, users just getting confused, okay, ten decentralized social network out there, I'd better just use Twitter. Okay, but do you find like, because social apps can build on different blockchains, right? And do you find it's still going to be a siloed environment? Even they come to the blockchain. The human nature is like sometimes people love each other, sometimes people hate each other.
05:04:40.588 - 05:04:53.810, Speaker A: You can't force those people who hate each other to stay in the same room. They're just going to fight. And you either just admit there's fight or you say, oh, I charge you $5 for fight inside my room.
05:04:53.810 - 05:05:10.708, Speaker A: You just don't pretend the fight doesn't exist. So the problem with the centralized social network after the Donald Trump ban is like, sometimes they pretend there's no fight and they cannot monetize the fight. Okay, so that's a problem.
05:05:10.708 - 05:05:24.184, Speaker A: And I think if we able to connect all the decentralized social network together and just say, hey, we preserve the culture and preserve the Twitter public square, we can say, hey, we are the Twitter. There three there too. We're the Twitter app.
05:05:24.184 - 05:05:31.116, Speaker A: Okay. I think that's going to be much more fun. I think in next five years we're going to just all switch technology.
05:05:31.116 - 05:05:45.010, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. As for the interoperability, actually we have the implement. Yeah, you are doing the interoperability stuff, right? Yeah, talk a little bit.
05:05:45.010 - 05:06:03.780, Speaker A: Actually, we have implemented our own kind of the stuff. Like we develop kind of a paradigm for the unified paradigm for the identity, data, asset resource, also for the status we build for games. But actually we have an interesting finding.
05:06:03.780 - 05:06:21.528, Speaker A: Actually, it occurs because of a bug all faulty due to the developers. One day the front end developer just mislink a token URL from one NFT to another. It's a very interesting finding because our users have web two users and web three users.
05:06:21.528 - 05:06:30.844, Speaker A: Web two users are really sensitive about the appearance. Actually. One NFT is like a blue coat, the other one is like space uniform.
05:06:30.844 - 05:06:42.684, Speaker A: So once the link is mistake, the web users are very and they are very annoying. That saying like, okay, you mistake my appearance, actually. But if you look at the token URL, it's the same NFT.
05:06:42.684 - 05:06:49.584, Speaker A: They only messed up with the front end. But when you log into games, actually they will come back the same. So webs users, they don't complain.
05:06:49.584 - 05:06:57.624, Speaker A: They know what happens. So they just say, okay, my asset is safe, so my interoperability is safe. All my record, all my price, they will not go down.
05:06:57.624 - 05:07:15.420, Speaker A: But web two users, they say, okay, give my money back as one of my space uniform, why give me a blue code? So actually after that we have two solutions. One is that we change the URL back because it's a mistake, so we just change the URL. Everything will be fine, but the web user don't satisfy.
05:07:15.420 - 05:07:32.444, Speaker A: So the best solution is that we build an NFT decks so that them to swap their own NFTs using the Dex. But you still see it's very interesting because the web user, they are more focusing on what they contribute to their own games. They contribute their money, contribute their emotion.
05:07:32.444 - 05:07:40.048, Speaker A: They want to inherit. Like, okay, I spend $7,000 in one game. I'm the leader of the community, so everyone call me the boss.
05:07:40.048 - 05:07:53.444, Speaker A: When I move to a new game, I don't want to start from the zero, from the ground. I just want to say, okay, I inherit all my asset, all my reputation, and start from that. I think that's a kind of a use case of the interoperability.
05:07:53.444 - 05:08:01.864, Speaker A: I want inherit my reputation. And from one, I want to be the boss, not from the zero. I'm a working BYC, so I'm the boss.
05:08:01.864 - 05:08:07.710, Speaker A: So that's what you want? I think. Yeah, that's what we found from a it. Got it.
05:08:07.710 - 05:08:22.732, Speaker A: Yeah. So we're running out of time. I think everyone covered most of it, but I just want to bring up a very interesting example for interoperability that I've always thought of Wilson mentioned reputation, right? Reputation being interoperable.
05:08:22.732 - 05:08:31.876, Speaker A: We're not going to vote this, but know, Suji or Wilson could incubate someone that will. Yeah. So the idea here is dating apps, right.
05:08:31.876 - 05:08:39.308, Speaker A: Today when we use dating apps, you swipe someone. He says, I work in finance. That could mean he's a investment banker at Morgan.
05:08:39.308 - 05:09:00.044, Speaker A: Or it could mean he's a Djen in his mom's basement trading shitcoins every day. Right. If you build a protocol, if there is a social protocol that is meant to verify the provenance of somebody's job, right? For example, a web three LinkedIn that actually has providence proves you actually work at this place, someone else could take that social profile and build a dating app on top of that.
05:09:00.044 - 05:09:06.608, Speaker A: Right. That's an incredibly powerful use case that is not possible today. One, because you can't prove providence in social apps in web two.
05:09:06.608 - 05:09:15.670, Speaker A: And two, because even if you could, the integration there is permissioned, right? It's permissioned by, let's say, LinkedIn, if they were able to do that. Correct? Yeah, very true. Very true.
05:09:15.670 - 05:09:47.470, Speaker A: I do have probably a few questions that I really want to discuss with you guys, but we have really limited amount of time. So today, really thank you for attending our conference and share all the insights with all of the people who are interested in decentralized social network hope that we can really do something big to evolve the industry. Thank you very much.
05:09:47.470 - 05:10:00.140, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. And after two panels on CK and Social now we are back again to our keynote session.
05:10:00.140 - 05:10:07.892, Speaker A: And next, we have quintus from Freshbots. Give us a taste of Intense. Like, intense is one of the hottest topics right now.
05:10:07.892 - 05:10:19.608, Speaker A: So Quintus will lead us through more deeply into intense. And we are really honored to have Quintus to join us remotely. And yeah, now we can share the screen right now.
05:10:19.608 - 05:10:26.350, Speaker A: And I'll give my mic back to Quintus now. Let's welcome Quintus. Thank you.
05:10:26.350 - 05:11:58.402, Speaker A: Sorry, we got some equipment issues. We'll fix it quicker. Yeah, it's working good now.
05:11:58.402 - 05:12:01.960, Speaker A: Yeah, good. Thank you. Okay.
05:12:01.960 - 05:12:20.860, Speaker A: Hey, Quintessential, we can start right now. Quintessentials, we can start right now. Thank you.
05:12:20.860 - 05:12:56.184, Speaker A: Okay. Do I stop now? Guys, can you hear? Sure. Okay.
05:12:56.184 - 05:13:03.324, Speaker A: Yeah, like right now. Cool. Okay.
05:13:03.324 - 05:13:14.610, Speaker A: Hello everyone. My name is Quintus Kilbourne and I'm presenting to a blank computer screen. So, yeah, I hope this works out for everyone.
05:13:14.610 - 05:13:46.664, Speaker A: And today I'll be talking about intents and coming at the intent sort of discourse from the mev perspective and I think sort of completing the picture or discussing some of the sort of factors that are important for the intense discourse that aren't always associated with intense when we talk about them. And so the talk today will be about balance. And what I'll be saying is that the intense discourse comes from one side.
05:13:46.664 - 05:14:16.260, Speaker A: One side in which we sort of accept that between the user and the blockchain there are intermediaries and that we want to use these intermediaries to get us better, more efficient outcomes. But at the same time, in doing so, we should put in the safeguards and the rails that protect the user from misbehaving intermediaries. Otherwise we sort of degrade all of the value propositions of blockchain.
05:14:16.260 - 05:14:45.784, Speaker A: And so let's start with part one, which is about letting go, right? And really that's intents in this case. So just to sort of communicate why I think intents have come into the discourse, I'll sort of discuss a basic model of a blockchain. And so the very basic idea is that the blockchain is a state machine, just like ethereum, and the blockchain has an operator.
05:14:45.784 - 05:15:11.430, Speaker A: In reality, this is a battle data set, but for now, I think we can just think of an operator and the operator requires permissions to transition the state machine. And these permissions come usually in the form of signed messages from users, most commonly in the form of transactions. Here I say edges because you can think of the states of a state machine as a graph, but that's not super important.
05:15:11.430 - 05:15:38.700, Speaker A: And then we think of all of the agents which are users, and the operator having a utility which depends on the state of the world and of the blockchain. And by the world, I just mean everything outside of the blockchain. But in reality, this is something like the and this is a good example because people care about, say, the value of their ETH on chain relative to the value on binance.
05:15:38.700 - 05:15:48.400, Speaker A: Right. And so what are some examples of these kinds of permissions? Well, one example is transactions. That's the example where most of us are familiar with.
05:15:48.400 - 05:16:17.048, Speaker A: And what transactions do is if you apply them to one state of the state machine, they'll give you a new one. So it's a mapping from states of the machine to states of the machine as well. And effectively what this does if you give one of these transactions to an operator is it allows the operator to transition along certain edges within the sort of state graph, which is not super important for the point I'm trying to make.
05:16:17.048 - 05:16:31.950, Speaker A: More important is that the other thing you can do with transactions is you can combine them. And the way we combine them is very relatively basic. We just chain them, we order them one after the other, and in doing so, we give the operator access to all of these different states that they can transition to.
05:16:31.950 - 05:17:07.156, Speaker A: And so we can separate these two kinds of activities that we can do with permissions, these permissioning messages into execution and into aggregation. And the reason that intents are interesting and the reason that I think they've come into the discourse is because really chaining isn't the only form of aggregation. We can combine intents and permissions in different ways and we tend to call these intents, right? Intents people generally mean referred to as messages permissions the users are sending which are not executable in isolation like a transaction.
05:17:07.156 - 05:17:38.892, Speaker A: They need to be combined with other messages that need to be processed by some intermediary. And so if these intents are messages which require aggregation, if nothing actually, I can just get to that point in a second. So why do we care about intents and why do we care about aggregation? Well, if we look at the challenges that users face, we can sort of see why having an intermediary is useful.
05:17:38.892 - 05:17:46.448, Speaker A: So users have preference elicitation issues, right? They have these very complex preferences. They don't even know what those are really. They can't state them explicitly.
05:17:46.448 - 05:18:19.744, Speaker A: But even if they could, they have to map or sort of communicate these preferences in this message space that the semantics of the EVM or whatever blockchain offer them. And that's often not possible. They have Unfundamental uncertainty if the utility depends on the state of the world and the state of the blockchain and time t any latency between them taking action on the blockchain and time t means that they have some uncertainty for what the state of the world will be.
05:18:19.744 - 05:18:37.248, Speaker A: So they don't know what the finance price will be. They also have strategic uncertainty. So not only does your outcome depend, the state of the next chain depend on what messages you send to the operator, it also depends on what messages other agents send.
05:18:37.248 - 05:19:04.110, Speaker A: And even more so, it depends what messages other agents send in response to your message that your information being public. And so an example of this is like Sandwiching, right? You set a slippage limit because you don't know if other agents will be trading in the same pair as you but if you set it too high, then there's a chance that you'll be sandwiched, which is adversarial. And so there's a lot of uncertainty about what other agents are doing.
05:19:04.110 - 05:19:43.944, Speaker A: There's technical uncertainty, which is to say that even if I knew exactly what the binance price will be when the next block is produced, and I knew exactly what all of the other agents are doing, I might not know what my outcome will be in the next block just because maybe the block builder or the operator is sort of grinding through all two to the end. Different orderings of the next block to try and find the most efficient outcome, then costs. Costs are an obvious example here where you might actually be able to address a lot of these issues by doing some computation.
05:19:43.944 - 05:20:14.260, Speaker A: The EVM or whatnot? But that's just sort of expensive. And so if we look at all of these, I think we can see that adding intents allows us to reduce friction for an ecosystem and the message space intermediaries can accept different kinds of messages. They don't have to restrict themselves only to the transaction space and allow users to condition their transactions on other kinds of information, not just the previous state of the chain.
05:20:14.260 - 05:20:43.564, Speaker A: Again, if an intermediary has better latency, think of like Blockbuilders and Ethereum latency to when the block will be produced, they can offer better services to the users. Strategic uncertainty is a big one. If you think of like cowswap, for example, it's an intermediary which allows the user's message effectively to reason about what other users are doing and to execute arguably more optimally.
05:20:43.564 - 05:21:27.740, Speaker A: Because of that, technical uncertainty can be overcome, for example, by allowing users to send messages which can be aggregated through some sort of convex optimization problem or something like that, which has a very sort of clear outcome. If you knew all the inputs, and if you knew all the inputs, then you would know what the outcome would be and then costs roll ups I think are an example of intermediaries. Obviously there's some semantics there and some nuance but if assets remain on the L one, if assets remain on Ethereum, then the roll up effectively is an intermediary which does a cost subsidization and allows you to still act on that initial chain on the EVM and Ethereum.
05:21:27.740 - 05:21:49.920, Speaker A: And so the basic point I'm trying to get to here yeah, I'm not showing my deck. Yeah, that seems important. Yeah, okay, well, I've gone through so many slides.
05:21:49.920 - 05:22:00.970, Speaker A: Yeah, I can reshare. No, I'm sorry. Ah, give me a second.
05:22:00.970 - 05:23:04.044, Speaker A: Ah, can you see the screen now? Yeah, still loading. No, can you see it now? Still nothing. Hello? Yeah, it's on my deck.
05:23:04.044 - 05:23:42.852, Speaker A: I was waiting for you to give me a good green light. There it is, can you see it? You don't see my deck? What do you see? Okay, you're going to just keep going. Can I? Okay, I'll just keep going.
05:23:42.852 - 05:24:20.850, Speaker A: Okay, we can skip all of that. That was all foreplay for the point I was trying to make, which is, I think why people talk about intents is because they're accepting that there need to be and there will be some intermediaries between the users and the blockchain for a variety of reasons. And in accepting this, we say, okay, let's use intents, because intents make having intermediaries a lot easier because transactions don't allow themselves don't lend themselves to the intervention of intermediaries as much as other message formats do.
05:24:20.850 - 05:24:30.630, Speaker A: And one example of this is how they can be aggregated. Yeah, please stop me if you can't see my slides or something. Okay.
05:24:30.630 - 05:24:59.470, Speaker A: And so the other half of the talk, which is I guess the half of the talk we're getting today is, okay. Now that we've gone through this part and we said okay, it actually gives us a lot of benefits to have intermediaries and to relinquish some control to them and to have message formats which allow these intermediaries to, I guess, execute things more efficiently for users. There needs to be another side.
05:24:59.470 - 05:25:29.270, Speaker A: What is the catch here? And the problem is that there are sort of abuses of freedom that can come from intermediaries, right? And without sort of justifying it, I'm going to claim that really the problem that we need to solve is how to restrict the intermediary and how to avoid relying on trust. Maybe that's an obvious point, but maybe for some people it's not. But just sort of take as an axiom that relying on trusting in the intermediaries is not good enough.
05:25:29.270 - 05:25:59.024, Speaker A: So one of the things we want from the intermediaries is integrity, which is to say that if they produce some output, they at least have given some valid input that produces this output. And so one example is we want to avoid this aggregation. If a block is produced, then the operator or the block producer who produced the block should have received an input, which gives us in a valid way.
05:25:59.024 - 05:26:14.516, Speaker A: And if you know, as part of the input, you have rules about bundling, about transactions which must be executed in a certain order and that ordering must be respected in the final block. You also want to avoid incorrect transition functions and roll ups. It's a very basic example.
05:26:14.516 - 05:26:47.648, Speaker A: And we actually know how to do this in the roll up case at least. But then there's also this question of provisioning information, right? So we know that if we can enforce that an output corresponds to a valid input, then we still don't know that the valid input is the correct input. And what I mean by this is if you think about, for example, like, cal swap or any kind of order flow auction, an order might be matched with a fill, but that might not be necessarily the best fill.
05:26:47.648 - 05:27:13.800, Speaker A: Or a cal swap batch might be full, but it may not be the entire batch as it should have been. And so you want some way to ensure that the input is correct and not being censored. Another example is like intermediaries which provide information about the external world, like binance prices or whatever and you want them to provide this information sort of promptly.
05:27:13.800 - 05:27:48.816, Speaker A: And then another example is privacy. And let's assume that we ensure that the intermediary is taking in all of the input which they're supposed to and it's the correct input and they're producing from that the correct output and we've restricted it in this sense we still haven't restricted the use of the information. And a basic example here is you can imagine some calsop kind of runner intermediary who is executing the protocol just as they are supposed to and then they front run the batch.
05:27:48.816 - 05:28:17.420, Speaker A: And this is also not something we want to see. And I guess my claim is that we need to solve these sort of sub problems in order to fully unlock the value of intermediaries because otherwise we're sort of allowing them to execute things efficiently but opening ourselves up to undesirable outcomes. And so I was talking about balance and I spoke about the first part without any slides really and then I spoke about the second.
05:28:17.420 - 05:28:57.290, Speaker A: But what is the interplay like? Where do the challenges lie? Can we not just sort of have intents and then impose these restrictions and it's cool? Well, I think some of the challenges come in when we look at sort of a latency overhead. So generally the means we have of restricting intermediaries introduce latency and this reintroduces uncertainty because if we have larger latency, there's more strategic information that the intermediary can't offer us, there's more sort of fundamental information or fundamental certainty they can't offer us. So proof computation time is an example of this.
05:28:57.290 - 05:29:25.180, Speaker A: If you're generating ZKPs, there's usually some delay. Another example is if you use data availability for consensus to make sure that the input some cowstop like construction isn't censored then this also has a block time and that delays you similarly tes of overhead. Another drawback is that too much privacy can kill counterparty discovery.
05:29:25.180 - 05:29:52.700, Speaker A: And I spoke about the sort of value of privacy but there's sort of this economic consideration as well which is to say that if everything is completely private and there's no information moving around then of course you don't have efficient outcomes. And a basic example here is that you can't have a fully private order flow auction, you can't completely obscure all information in every sense about orders and expect people to bid on them. Maybe you can, but it's hard and probably quite inefficient.
05:29:52.700 - 05:30:18.560, Speaker A: Then another issue which is maybe slightly different from the others is that we'd like to sort of make things easier for the intermediary as well. But how do we sort of avoid denial of service risk for the intermediary, especially when privacy comes into things. For example, you can't just send arbitrary encrypted data to the intermediary because decrypting this data is expensive.
05:30:18.560 - 05:30:31.652, Speaker A: And if you have to do this with every random blob that comes your way, you're very sort of docile. You need some guarantees that this at least pays you something. Yeah.
05:30:31.652 - 05:30:41.528, Speaker A: And so that's the end of the talk. Or the end of the second half of the talk, which is the entirety of your talk, I guess. And I sort of just want to point out some things I didn't cover.
05:30:41.528 - 05:30:57.696, Speaker A: Some sort of leaps in logic, maybe. One is that I didn't really give examples of intermediaries we see today, but there are plenty if they come to mind. And then I also didn't sort of make the argument for why reliance on trust and intermediaries is bad, although it's somewhat obvious.
05:30:57.696 - 05:31:06.788, Speaker A: And then I also didn't go into how flashboards is thinking about these issues. But, yeah, that's a talk for another day, I guess. Thank you.
05:31:06.788 - 05:31:19.012, Speaker A: I didn't know if anyone can hear me. Thank you. Thank you, Quintus, for joining us remotely.
05:31:19.012 - 05:34:13.250, Speaker A: Really thankful for that. Our next speaker is two panels on gaming, and we have a tea break for ten minutes, so we can go around and chat and come back after ten minutes. I wanna do the funky do it to the group.
05:34:13.250 - 05:37:33.934, Speaker A: That you deep dance to the group. What I meant what I meant what I'm what I meant what I meant what what I can do the founding the group that you eat that to the group. The dream what I wanna do the fucking it's.
05:37:33.934 - 05:39:40.300, Speaker A: It Sam. Ram. Ram SA.
05:39:40.300 - 05:41:28.540, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Our panel is going to start soon, so please take your seat and enjoy. Our next panel end at 320.
05:41:28.540 - 05:43:14.890, Speaker A: Sam. It's Jam. It Scream.
05:43:14.890 - 05:46:42.278, Speaker A: Do what you want to do? Say what you really want to say? Scream? Don't let nobody tell you how you want to behave? Don't what you want to do? Say what you really want to say? Don't let nobody tell you who you gotta be? It's terrifying, but you're on your own? That's how it is? Your life is not unlo? If you find it open, you don't love, it's up to you? Stand up and make it right? Do you see the wrong hate what's going on? Changes in the eye, in the word and in the vote? It's your song? Scream? Do what you want to do? Say what you really want to say? Don't let nobody tell you how you want to behave? Scream? Do what you want to do? Say what you really want to fight? Don't let nobody tell you who you're not? Your knees are shaking and your mouth is dry cause I'm bad? I made you feel like you won't cry? To your best? Get off your face? No time to be polite? Gotta get it to rise? Changes in the head in. The heart in the mind do what you wanna do say what you really wanna say don't let nobody tell you how you want to behave do what you want to do say what you really want to tell you who you gotta be who you gotta be telling you who you gotta be now tell you how behind it our talks is going to begin again. So please take your seat and stay silent.
05:46:42.278 - 05:47:14.340, Speaker A: Please. Thank you. You.
05:47:14.340 - 05:47:46.420, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Our panel for the gaming is going to begin. So, people in the backend, please stay silent and find your seat.
05:47:46.420 - 05:48:31.750, Speaker A: And for this panel, we have Xiao from Hashke Capital as the moderator and Gabby from YGG, peter from Particle Network, michael from exterior, karaoke from Bigcraft, and Jason from Immutable X. So please welcome all the guests and our panelists to come to the stage. Thank you very much.
05:48:31.750 - 05:48:53.130, Speaker A: So we're okay, well, hello everyone. I'm Xiao. Xiao from Hashki Capital.
05:48:53.130 - 05:49:16.550, Speaker A: And yeah, let me do some self intro first. So, we are like one of the top blockchain VC from Asia, and we started to invest in crypto and blockchain space since 2015. And now we've been managing three independent funds, and we've already got more than 300 portfolios.
05:49:16.550 - 05:49:34.890, Speaker A: Basically, we can invest it in everything related to blockchain, and apparently gaming is one of our focus. So, yeah, let's welcome our panelists here. So, would you like to do self intro first, maybe starting with Gabby.
05:49:34.890 - 05:49:40.522, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Gabby Dizon, co founder of Yield Guild Games, or YGG.
05:49:40.522 - 05:49:53.540, Speaker A: We are a web three gaming guild. That means we bring our Web Three game community into different blockchain games. We've also been recently developing quest platforms so that we can connect games and communities better.
05:49:53.540 - 05:50:01.010, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. This is Peter from particle network. I'm the CTO and co founder.
05:50:01.010 - 05:50:17.290, Speaker A: In general. What we are building is to simplify the developer experience and the user experience of Web Three. Not specifically games, but you know that the Web Three game has a very large potential.
05:50:17.290 - 05:50:49.134, Speaker A: We have two products, and one is we call it ZK Wallet as service. That means we can help user on board seamlessly sedlessly with their social accounts, but also protect the user's privacy. And we are also building Intent Fusion protocol to transfer currently the transaction centric interaction to the Intent centric interaction.
05:50:49.134 - 05:50:53.326, Speaker A: Thank you. Hi everyone. I'm Carlos from Bicraft.
05:50:53.326 - 05:51:05.720, Speaker A: We're a legacy Web Two games investment platform. Begin investing in gaming in 2016 and in crypto gaming in 2021. Currently deploying about $300 million of capital in the space.
05:51:05.720 - 05:51:31.956, Speaker A: Hey, folks, Jason Swen here from Immutable. We are a set of platform tools for game builders and also for gamers, all towards the mission of mainstream adoption for games built on Web Three tech. So, we started off at Starkware, now we are off with Polygon as well.
05:51:31.956 - 05:51:42.756, Speaker A: So multi roll up support writing back to Ethereum and mission aligned with a lot of folks here up on stage. Hi everyone. I'm Michael, CEO of Exterior.
05:51:42.756 - 05:51:54.344, Speaker A: Exterior is platform and a publisher for games. It's a platform for players and publisher for content partners. We also incubate our own first party games.
05:51:54.344 - 05:52:11.136, Speaker A: We have several first party games including first person shooters, strategy games, RPG games and so on. Well, thank you everyone. So now I will go with our first topic.
05:52:11.136 - 05:52:33.832, Speaker A: So apparently gaming is a very booming sector in Web Three and especially from the application layer. So I would ask everyone here how would you define a good game? So what's your expectation from a good game? Maybe start with Gabby as well. Sure.
05:52:33.832 - 05:52:53.612, Speaker A: I'll take this from a community centric perspective since this is a lot of what our work does. So we want to have our community discover many different types of games. And I think what makes Web Three games different is that they have some form of economic aspect around them powered by blockchain.
05:52:53.612 - 05:53:12.752, Speaker A: So this doesn't mean it's straight play to earn like you do with a couple of clicks and you earn money immediately. There's actually different mechanics that we do. So for example, we publish people's soul bount token achievements for stuff that they've done in game and we put it on their wallet that's building their Web Three reputation.
05:53:12.752 - 05:53:29.328, Speaker A: We go on different questing programs with different games so that there's different things for people to do. Earn achievements, have the ability to own assets. And we also like to see games that have different coats of quote unquote jobs or roles within their game economy.
05:53:29.328 - 05:53:45.730, Speaker A: So you may be a player, you may be in high end esports, you may be a content creator, you may be a moderator, you may be someone who's just like helping out with content. So we like to facilitate and enable a lot of these different roles around a game. Thank you.
05:53:45.730 - 05:54:02.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this question maybe is not related to Webstery. From my point of view, that good game. Everyone has played some game.
05:54:02.310 - 05:54:30.432, Speaker A: I think maybe we don't have single way to say what is a good game because everyone have their different taste. For me, I like FPS games, but other kind of games maybe is not my favorite. But I think there are some essential parts of a good game.
05:54:30.432 - 05:54:37.760, Speaker A: I think the first day is that the gameplay is very important. It should be fun. The apple game.
05:54:37.760 - 05:54:46.100, Speaker A: Have fun. This is super important. It should have the ability to engage the user, to attract new users.
05:54:46.100 - 05:55:10.844, Speaker A: And I think the second very important part is the economics in our games, not only Web Three games. The design of the economics is super important. Like we have played a lot of games, they have versions every year maybe.
05:55:10.844 - 05:55:33.056, Speaker A: And the lifecycle depends a lot on the economics design. And the third thing I think for a good game it should be easy for user to play. It shouldn't have a lot of barrier for users.
05:55:33.056 - 05:55:59.272, Speaker A: And I think this is the key challenges for Webster games right now. We can have very good Web Three games with the good gameplay, but we all know that currently the Web Three games, they have the technical barriers for Web Two users. This is my thoughts on the good games.
05:55:59.272 - 05:56:10.456, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. Carlos, maybe you share some opinion as an Me. Let me split this in two parts.
05:56:10.456 - 05:56:33.270, Speaker A: So the first is what is a good game, right? And just talking about a game and not a business, I think simplistically. It's a piece of entertainment that captures a user in a state of flow for an extended period of time. Usually good games transport you to a place where you forget that time is going by and you're just immersed in an activity and next thing you know, you spent a bunch of money and had some fun.
05:56:33.270 - 05:56:42.324, Speaker A: Different people will have fun with different games. And maybe you'll enter that state of flow with Candy Crush. Maybe you'll enter that state of flow in Diablo.
05:56:42.324 - 05:56:53.004, Speaker A: Maybe you'll enter that state of flow in Eve. Maybe the way that you enter Flow State isn't even fun as we would think of fun. Like, if you look a game like Eve, eve is not particularly fun.
05:56:53.004 - 05:57:14.464, Speaker A: It's stressful and it's political and it's economic. But for those people, for those gamers, they lose track of time and they find passion and belonging in that narrative. And so a good game is a piece of entertainment that holds a user in a state of flow for an extended period of time as they engage with that world.
05:57:14.464 - 05:57:33.976, Speaker A: In terms of what makes it a good investment it's a game that holds a user in a state of flow and then gets a portion of those users to part away with enough money to make it into a good business and make it profitable. Yeah, I definitely like that breakdown. Maybe I'll take a different stab at it for a good game.
05:57:33.976 - 05:58:11.568, Speaker A: When I think about flow and passing time, we tend to think of it as like a core loop and it's a lot like tension relief or a dopamine release, right? Whether you're thinking about Tears of the Kingdom, for example, it's exploratory. But this idea of landing at these mini puzzles you solve, you get that dopamine hit of feeling like you've cracked something or even go back to the Tetris era of building something up and having that line drop and it clears and you get that moment where it's this AHA moment. I think that's at a micro level, we try to look for those loops, we try to look for things that will capture the gamer's attention.
05:58:11.568 - 05:58:38.670, Speaker A: And loops can take on different forms, but I think depending on your niche, depending on your personality, the loop can come with like an auto battler. It could come from a dota or a league, like defeating your enemy. It could come from very small things at a micro level that require fast movements or grand strategy it's just that loop that keeps people coming back, right? It's almost like you leave the game and you're thinking about that loop and that dopamine hit.
05:58:38.670 - 05:58:52.236, Speaker A: That's what I think. Ultimately, if you break down what makes folks want to spend a lot of time in a place, it's that piece. And so when we think about good games and good entertainment, we're looking for that hook, and we're looking for that loop.
05:58:52.236 - 05:59:09.672, Speaker A: And then from a business perspective, I don't think I have anything to add in addition to what everybody's already said, except that it used to be that games were one and done. And I think increasingly, a good game, from a business perspective, is increasingly a live service that has perpetual revenue models. So that's really interesting.
05:59:09.672 - 05:59:30.240, Speaker A: Right? They don't really have an end date anymore like they used to and you can ship and you can iterate and iterate and iterate so that's the two angles. Yeah, I think everyone has said enough so I make a conclusion very simple. A good games is a game that makes money and it's addictive.
05:59:30.240 - 05:59:52.644, Speaker A: I would say that games, some games cannot make money, can still be good games like Tetris is a very good game, right? But I don't think they make a lot of money. But then addictive is very important. To put it in a more elegant way is that the player will come and come again to play the game.
05:59:52.644 - 06:00:06.252, Speaker A: And that is very important because this is how we measure what is. A good game. And of course, we also measure the profitability of a game, but I think more importantly is the retention of the game.
06:00:06.252 - 06:00:24.624, Speaker A: Or if there is a second episode, third episode that your players will continue to come back for more of this content or the gameplay. And I think that's really it. And obviously, we are also talking about product market fit that we have all talked about.
06:00:24.624 - 06:00:38.656, Speaker A: So there are different tastes for players, different needs. Some want games to be very actionable, very exciting. Some want games to be like going into a meditation.
06:00:38.656 - 06:00:54.392, Speaker A: And it's just like movies, someone's romantic movies, someone's action movies. And then as long as it fits a particular type of people, then it's a good game. Thanks everyone.
06:00:54.392 - 06:01:24.420, Speaker A: So apparently everyone think a good game should be at least well worth you spending time on. So most people think for next generation of Web three game it should be like a precondition to have a good product or the product is also a good one in traditional world. So as a result, maybe the next generation of a game should be something like web 2.5.
06:01:24.420 - 06:01:53.230, Speaker A: But on top of the Web Two product, what do you think web Three can bring to the traditional world? Is it like asset liquidity or is it faster to bootstrap community at the very early stage. Yeah. So our opinion is that you use Web Three not as an acquisition tool, but to deepen the engagement with your existing community.
06:01:53.230 - 06:02:21.350, Speaker A: So if Web Three gives you engagement and ownership of assets, and for someone who want to own your assets, they should really be interested in the environment that you're building. Right. Whether it's a game, virtual world, metaverse, whatever you call it, and when they start caring about that, when they want to engage further, when they want to spend into the virtual economy, I think that's where ownership plays a big part.
06:02:21.350 - 06:02:46.410, Speaker A: Myself, I've paid a lot of money for different games that I cared about, but I think it would have unlocked more if I had ownership of the assets. And so I don't think that blockchain really brings that much to the actual core loop of the gameplay. But when you're ready to engage further and deeper into the economy, that's when Web Three plays a big part.
06:02:46.410 - 06:03:11.110, Speaker A: Yeah, I fully agree. Actually, the previous question we talked about what is a good game? Actually, I think for Web Three, yeah, it should be a good game first and then it's good Web Three game. So what a web three can bring to good web two? Game.
06:03:11.110 - 06:04:02.224, Speaker A: I want to say it's some phi or ponds, right? But I think everyone know that. I think behind this, it tells us the power of the Web Three community and also the power of the Tokenomics to traditional web Two games. So I think for the next week, right, every high quality games, I know that a lot of game studios, they are building really good games and they are utilizing the Web Three Tokenomics and also the power of the community to help to separate their games.
06:04:02.224 - 06:04:31.364, Speaker A: Because in traditional Web Two games, it's really hard to get acquire new users because the market is too crowded. But in Web Three, yeah, I think there are some new users different from Web Two games. So if we can utilize Web Three's benefits, combine this with high quality Web Two games, maybe you can get both users.
06:04:31.364 - 06:04:49.940, Speaker A: And this is more than what we can get from traditional Web Two business model of a game. Thank you. So when we think about great games, we think that they tend to resemble a great digital world or a digital nation.
06:04:49.940 - 06:05:17.884, Speaker A: I think it's easier to imagine that framework. For example, if you have complex games like World of Warcraft be even simpler games, it is a digital world that you come to care about. I think that as we reflect on the history of humans and society for thousands and thousands of years, what we have seen in the physical world is that when people have property rights and commerce rights, economies grow, people are entrepreneurial, they find things to do, they build things on top.
06:05:17.884 - 06:05:45.684, Speaker A: A lot of the history of economic opening from basically the 1990s forward, if you think about the former Soviet Union was going to people and saying, hey, now you can be an entrepreneur, now you can own property. And you see a radical transformation of how people engage in the physical world and grow the physical world through property rights and through commerce rights. So for us, what crypto brings to gaming is digitally native property rights and digitally native commerce rights to digital worlds.
06:05:45.684 - 06:06:11.996, Speaker A: It's that simple. Yeah, I think the value of web three right now in crypto or in gaming, there's just so many really cool things it could unlock, right? We talk a lot about interoperability or we talk about bootstrapping, the cold start problem and user acquisition. We talk about better tolls so you don't have to pay distribution via centralized bodies like iOS or Android.
06:06:11.996 - 06:06:28.736, Speaker A: It's all true. Many folks in the space, probably many in this room, I think we all believe it my view. I think since working at Immutable this past 18 months, I've come to really reduce my expectations on what I think will be that value for gamers.
06:06:28.736 - 06:07:04.130, Speaker A: Practically, I think most gamers don't care, they just want to play a good game. And I think that AHA moment could be as simple as you playing a game and instead of that being locked behind, that's money sunk forever. It's like there's some way, very simply, for me to turn my love for a game and then when I move on to a new title to buy a case of beer or really easily get a pizza, just like that idea of on and off ramps, like real worlds, digital worlds combining with such a frictionless way.
06:07:04.130 - 06:07:22.132, Speaker A: What we're really talking about is open versus closed there. But I wonder if that might just be the first thing that captures people's imaginations is oh, I don't know, I can do that before without violating the terms of service and had to sell it on Craigslist or Ebay. I actually just press this button and oddly I can buy a pizza with like it's those little things.
06:07:22.132 - 06:07:46.360, Speaker A: I think the future is really bright because there's so much possibility baked into the technology. But I think the path to get there is going to be these small little eureka moments that we can provide to the end user. We are often right now for game developers gated by the practical bear market realities of surviving to a game launch and the technical hurdles required to get that game on chain.
06:07:46.360 - 06:08:03.124, Speaker A: That tends to be the thing that most of games struggle behind right now. And hopefully we can get over that and get those small Eureka moments along the way. Adding to that, of course, I agree with many of the viewpoints of our guests here.
06:08:03.124 - 06:08:40.464, Speaker A: Adding to that also in a summary way is that I think games that digital ownership is important can be made into web free game. But what kind of game that digital ownership is important? I think there are at least two or three ways to look at it. One is that games that are high stake, for example, a competitive game that I might lose my weapons, I might lose my army or things like that, those are high stakes games, right? And then digital ownership becomes important.
06:08:40.464 - 06:09:08.520, Speaker A: And at the same time, games that is multiplayer with a digital economy, that when I own a property that is important, that can be rented, that can be used for other purposes, for other players, then that is important. Then digital ownership becomes important and blockchain or web three becomes important. And of course there are other games extending to that.
06:09:08.520 - 06:09:38.290, Speaker A: There are also other games that, for example, like the multiplayer game that we do in web two, there are players who want to become kings, there are players who want to just to build armies and also there are players who organize the alliances and so on and so forth. And that all makes digital ownership becomes more important. And some of them might still want to earn some money and which makes sense if there is a whole economy there.
06:09:38.290 - 06:10:00.580, Speaker A: Thank you. Well, the next question would be some individual questions because everyone sits in a unique position of the whole industry. So first I want to start with Gabby, so we can see that we may in a gap of two generation of games.
06:10:00.580 - 06:10:29.744, Speaker A: So most of the sophisticated products are still in development, but existing games are not active as before. So what can guild do at this moment and what kind of value you can bring to your members? Yes, so I think guilds have had to pivot a lot in the last year and a half. And if you look at guilds, what are they? They're like the small to medium enterprises of web three.
06:10:29.744 - 06:11:03.160, Speaker A: They're groups of people that want to do stuff in web three, whether it's playing a game, being involved in a dow, playing around in DFI, and the business model of axio infinity kind of made it easy for people. To basically make money two years ago, especially in an environment where there was a lot of new money coming in and a lot of other games actually copied that model as well. And now most of the games that we talk to under development have different economic systems that don't make it easy for players to earn.
06:11:03.160 - 06:11:22.540, Speaker A: You have to prove that you have contribution into the economy and there's other ways that you can reward people. It could be via recognition, via status. So our guild is still around, we still have a core community that is very interested in exploring the concepts within web three games.
06:11:22.540 - 06:11:41.944, Speaker A: They know that there's not a lot of money to be earned now, but they're actually stacking reputation, especially within the questing program. We have a community questing program called gap or guild advancement program that works with different games, issues their own quests. And our community actually controls which games to partner with, what the quests are.
06:11:41.944 - 06:11:57.324, Speaker A: And for those that finish with quest, we give them soul mount token achievements for their reputation. So we've seen a lot of engagement in that. There's almost 3000 players in the current season doing that and now we're recruiting guilds from other games to take part of that as well.
06:11:57.324 - 06:12:13.270, Speaker A: So I would say that guilds are alive and well. Those players that were there mostly to make money in the short term have left or doing other things. But I think the guild as a concept is here to stay because it's basically a collection of people that want to do something together.
06:12:13.270 - 06:12:18.512, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. And next question for Peter.
06:12:18.512 - 06:12:39.710, Speaker A: So, could you share some insights from a user side? Because you're building a tooling layer. So what kind of pain points do you see from users? And I know you just launched your V Two last night. So how will you solve this problem with your V Two products? Yeah, sure.
06:12:39.710 - 06:13:18.760, Speaker A: Actually, before we start Particle Network, we are a game studio. We have successfully launched several games across the world, in the world market. And we know the challenges not only for a Web Three game, but also for a Web Two game to be successful, to get new users and finally to get profit.
06:13:18.760 - 06:13:43.980, Speaker A: I think every game developer, if they have the experience, they know the importance of the tools to support the lifecycle of their game. Right? They have to do a lot of testing, some A B testing. They have to use a lot of data and also a lot of analysis tools.
06:13:43.980 - 06:14:35.756, Speaker A: From my experience, we pay a lot of attention on the funeral side, right? We need to know the overall conversion rate of the registration, some levels, how user play your game or some features. Do we like it or not like it? We rely on data and then we start to want to bring these kind of scenes, the tools to Web Three. Because we found that in Web Three area such intelligence tools of some necessary common functionalities haven't been provided to the developers.
06:14:35.756 - 06:15:31.350, Speaker A: And we all know that if we have the modular SDKs for developers, this will definitely give the market more good Webstery games. So we started from solving the login issue because in Webstery every time the new user without a Webster wallet, when he wants to play the game, he has to download unseparated Webster wallet application in the browser he has to download extension, right? The experience is quite strange for the user because when he plays any Web Two games, no such precise. This is very weird for them and also the sighting precise is quite complex for them to understand.
06:15:31.350 - 06:16:12.752, Speaker A: We provide the social logging feature plus of MPC TSS technology to provide the seedless onboarding experience just like any Web Two games and also the sector scene for the user the whole lifecycle, the conversion rate, the second thing is about the unramp right? Users need to get the cryptid tokens to do the interactions with your game. So we provide the unramp features and yeah, we are also trying to solve some the underlying barriers for users. So this is the V Two of particle network we are building.
06:16:12.752 - 06:16:45.888, Speaker A: So we want to solve the privacy issues, we want to improve the efficiency of user interacting with the blockchain. So we have the ZK Walletized service product and we also have General Intent Fusion protocol to help user only they need to express the intent and also for developers, they also don't have a better use experience. Thank you and congratulations on the V Two launching.
06:16:45.888 - 06:17:33.130, Speaker A: And for Carlos, I know Bigcroft has a very diversified gaming portfolio. So would you like to share your investment thesis towards content provider and gaming platform? Maybe the timing and when to invest in content and when to invest it in gaming platform? Sure. We've been investing in games since 2016 and the way that we approach web three gaming is strongly rooted in our experience in Web two gaming we're primarily looking for developers that have shipped games zero to one because we think that making games is very hard.
06:17:33.130 - 06:17:55.760, Speaker A: We are also prepared to fund games that will take four years to come out. The best demo that I got recently, or not the best one, but certainly like one of the best demos that we got recently was a demo for a game that will still take two years to get finished. And just yesterday I got another great demo from a portfolio company and that's going to take one year to get finished.
06:17:55.760 - 06:18:32.616, Speaker A: For us, taking time to make a great game is perfectly acceptable, especially if you're trying to make the games that as Michael says, digital ownership are important. Usually casual games can be a lot quicker to make, but usually casual games are casual and the casual consumer is less likely to be looking for digital ownership. In terms of the timing of when to invest in platforms or say when to invest in infrastructure versus when to invest in content, we today are skewed 70% towards content, 30% towards infrastructure.
06:18:32.616 - 06:18:59.604, Speaker A: The reason for that is, in our opinion, a lot of people are trying to invest in infrastructure because they want diversification. But when it comes to diversification, when there are not a lot of games getting funded and you think about how many great games will exist with Web Three components in one or two years, there's just not going to be a lot of them. And usually infrastructure companies needs dozens or hundreds of clients to make sense.
06:18:59.604 - 06:19:19.768, Speaker A: And so in our view, a lot of the people that think that they'll be diversified won't be diversified because they'll be competing for a small number of games between a bunch of business models that need a lot of numbers to begin with. Where we do choose to invest in infrastructure, we focus on problems that our portfolio has today. And so, for example, user acquisition.
06:19:19.768 - 06:19:41.700, Speaker A: A lot of our portfolio wants to know how to acquire users better in web Two or web Three. So we focus on that digital identity, anti civil protection. We guide our infrastructure investments around current problems of our portfolio so that we can immediately help both our portfolio solve the problems, but also the infrastructure companies that we invest in go to market faster.
06:19:41.700 - 06:19:57.672, Speaker A: We would expect that maybe over time we'll skew closer to 50 50 infrastructure and content, which is what our Web Two fund split at. But for right now, we're excited to just keep backing content, or not just content, but more content. Yeah.
06:19:57.672 - 06:20:09.516, Speaker A: Thank you. Very impressive. Well, for Jason, I would ask a little bit challenging question to you.
06:20:09.516 - 06:20:35.464, Speaker A: So we can see that a lot of layer one or layer two ecosystem, they all collaborate with top gaming studios, so I know you are also doing that. So what kind of value add you can provide or what's your advantage in terms of attracting a studio? Yeah, lovely question, straight on the spot. Yeah, I think we have a joke at Immutable.
06:20:35.464 - 06:20:50.328, Speaker A: It's like friends don't let friends build blockchains. That's not a knock on blockchains, by the way, because I think there's just some wonderful set of work that's being done there. But I think if you're talking about games, right, Carlos was just saying it's hard to build a game.
06:20:50.328 - 06:21:17.680, Speaker A: It's like really hard to build a game and the path to get there and the developer friction that exists today in trying to interact with some of the technology we're trying to bring to mass market, it's really high. And so what we try to do at Immutable is just make that as dead simple as possible in a way that developers can understand. So it's like, yeah, don't interact with a smart contract, we'll deal with that for you.
06:21:17.680 - 06:21:35.924, Speaker A: Just call these rest APIs if you want to mint something. Like all the features that people think about, inventory management, trading primitives, like all the stuff that comprises the mechanics of a game's design, that difficulty gets abstracted away. And that's what we're on that mission on.
06:21:35.924 - 06:21:49.740, Speaker A: And we think of the same thing for gamers, by the way, right? It's this two sides of the equation. You have to help the games get to market and survive and make sure they don't Outburn themselves into oblivion. And then on the gamer side, you have to make sure once that game is out to market that it gets found.
06:21:49.740 - 06:22:06.364, Speaker A: So there's a discoverability problem that they onboard. I mean, your bar right now is a search term in the iOS store and a double right click of your thumb and it's like 63 seconds from wanting to play something to downloading it and being in the game. That's a really high threshold.
06:22:06.364 - 06:22:24.890, Speaker A: And so we've got a lot of work to do and. In my opinion, humble. We got a lot which even for us at Immutable, we just got a road that I want to challenge us to make sure that we keep that goal in mind because we got to get as close to that as possible to get mainstream adoption of games with Web Three tech.
06:22:24.890 - 06:22:50.610, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah. And for Michael, I know you've been working in traditional gaming industry for very long time, so yeah, we observe that in Web Two industry, most of the gaming studio or content provider, they tend to publish their products by themselves.
06:22:50.610 - 06:23:46.848, Speaker A: So as a gaming publisher, do you foresee the similar situation in Web Three or what's the best way to publish a game in Web Three? Actually, even in the web Two traditional gaming world, there are a lot of games being published by third party companies as well. So I think the question you have is for Web Three a lot of the games started out in building a communities and if the game is good then there will be a good communities and the producer know how to manage the communities. But I think what is important even for Web Two or Web Three world there is the publisher that is really, really focused on three things.
06:23:46.848 - 06:24:05.736, Speaker A: One is finding the users, understanding the users and surfacing the users. Especially nowadays a lot of games are like game as a surface, so surfacing the users is very important as well. So with this it's just a definition of work.
06:24:05.736 - 06:24:34.690, Speaker A: The producers and the execution team will focus very much on building the games. And at the same time, the publisher will be very focused on understanding the users and reflect whatever they found out to the producers and also to the execution team. And then finding the users and then also surfacing the users so that the production team can be very focused on what they want to do.
06:24:34.690 - 06:25:15.710, Speaker A: Is it better to have two work as one team or is it better to have third party publishers? I think both ways can be fine, but it's two very different business. So I think there are a lot of people or a lot of producers, they are very focused in the game itself and it would be better for those to find third party publisher to help them. Of course, there are people who are able to do everything right, but there aren't that many people who can do that right.
06:25:15.710 - 06:25:35.190, Speaker A: I think it's actually better to focus in what they are good at. Maybe a follow up question here. So what skill set do you think web Three gaming team should have? Maybe both product side and publishing side.
06:25:35.190 - 06:26:14.720, Speaker A: On the publishing side it's like this because for example, building a community for some producers it seems to be easy, right? But managing the community, I mean in the first place, you know, you have a good game, good idea, good graphics, good concepts and then you have a small community, but expanding it, managing it. And the community will ask a lot of questions like, I want the game to do this and that. And it will be very difficult for some producers to manage them because some of the producer will think, oh, this is a stupid question.
06:26:14.720 - 06:26:40.936, Speaker A: Right? How do I answer this? Right? There will be some skill set here and further along, when the communities become more bigger or more engaged, then it's very important to find out the ways to amplify the good things and then deampplify the bad things. Right. There will always be bad words and then always be good things.
06:26:40.936 - 06:27:00.800, Speaker A: Like, for example, in World of Warcraft, right? So it is a very old trick. You might find an Annie like a granny playing a game, 65 year old, 70 year old, and then she might have some mental problem. But then after she played a game, it fixed her mental problem.
06:27:00.800 - 06:27:20.980, Speaker A: Right. It's a good story, but if it is just a normal publisher or a normal producer, he don't know how to explain the story in a good way and it might turn some good things into bad. But a very experienced publisher will know how to make it into a good story and amplify something good.
06:27:20.980 - 06:27:30.664, Speaker A: Right. So I think it's really a publisher work. I don't think it's like a normal producer can do exactly how to make it into something good.
06:27:30.664 - 06:27:38.232, Speaker A: And unfortunately, some people can make it into something bad, actually. Yeah. Thank you for sharing.
06:27:38.232 - 06:27:46.590, Speaker A: All yeah. My last question would be about onchain gaming. So we can see on chain gaming is getting more and more hot.
06:27:46.590 - 06:28:04.916, Speaker A: Well, getting more and more popular, and a lot of people are talking about that. So what do you think of onchain gaming? Does it have a huge potential or it has a very limited ceiling. Okay, so I have a very specific take on this.
06:28:04.916 - 06:28:28.232, Speaker A: I think that on chain gaming is where the future primitives of play will be invented. It reminds me of what CryptoKitties did in 2017, which was quite new and really exciting at that time, which really led to a lot of the development in NFTs. I don't think it's anywhere near ready for a mass market right now.
06:28:28.232 - 06:28:54.100, Speaker A: And I do think that the games that are doing, call it Web 2.5 or Free to Play plus Web Three, have the job of bringing a lot of players into Web Three and discovering what the unique aspects of Web Three that are bringing to gaming. But I do think that in the future, and who knows when that might be? Five years, ten years, three years? I do think a lot of the new forms of play will be discovered via onchain gaming.
06:28:54.100 - 06:29:17.470, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, I think Webstery game definitely have a very high potential. And we have saw in the last circle, we have Infinity, right? It's a Web Three game, but the profit is more than any web two game.
06:29:17.470 - 06:29:43.120, Speaker A: Yeah, we are facing some challenges also because I infrastructure Builder, I think we can work together to solve all the challenges of the web three games. And I think the key point here is web three game. The user has the ownership.
06:29:43.120 - 06:30:03.140, Speaker A: I think this is something very important. I think this will the key for the potential of web three games because it's totally different from any web two game. Split up innovation between continuous innovation and discontinuous innovation.
06:30:03.140 - 06:30:25.884, Speaker A: Continuous innovation is innovation that sort of makes sense and if you think about we have a game like World of Warcraft, we'll now have that game have ownership and property rights, the black market will become a white market, that economy will grow. It's kind of easy to see where it goes on chain gaming is about discontinuous innovation. It's about something very new and fresh.
06:30:25.884 - 06:30:49.636, Speaker A: And so for example, when the iPhone comes out and it has GPS, I think we look at it and we say hey, I don't need maps anymore, I can just turn on GPS and it'll take me wherever we have to go. And then someone makes Uber and sends a car to your house. Right? And that's like the super shocking thing that no one expected to come after the continuous innovation of putting GPS in phones.
06:30:49.636 - 06:31:09.704, Speaker A: I don't think that today we have seen what the discontinuous innovation of onchain gaming exactly looks like. But there are two things that are important in web two gaming or in gaming history that I think might point us to the direction of it. One is what Jason was talking earlier about forever games.
06:31:09.704 - 06:31:23.888, Speaker A: And so games have gone from being one hit. You pay $50, you play that game, you play the next game into being live services games that last for a very long time. Anything that's built on chain by definition should be able to last forever.
06:31:23.888 - 06:31:56.284, Speaker A: And so it is infrastructure for forever games. And then the second part is a lot of the best games that we've seen have come from mods and so Dota was a mod of World of Warcraft and League was a mod of Dota, basically. And so if you think about putting games on chain and allowing users to interact with those contracts and mod them and grow them, which is what we've seen in Dark Forest and then having the infrastructure to have forever games it seems like there's enough precedent with the history of gaming to tell us that there's something there.
06:31:56.284 - 06:32:10.290, Speaker A: We just don't know what it looks like yet. But I think we'll see the Uber to maps, we will have something to Eve with crypto, right? Or the World of Warcraft with crypto, which is more where Web 2.5 gaming sits today.
06:32:10.290 - 06:32:27.416, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll try to keep brief. I think on chain gaming is intellectually super interesting, but I think practically it's far away. It's hard to say what that will materialize in.
06:32:27.416 - 06:32:34.696, Speaker A: I think that's sort of what you're getting across the panel. But I'm here for it. I love the idea of it.
06:32:34.696 - 06:32:47.820, Speaker A: I just don't know. I think we have a lot of steps before we start to break. We're already breaking gamers brains in many ways by being like, hey, sign up for this wallet, and you actually really own this thing, and you don't have to sell it in a closed marketplace.
06:32:47.820 - 06:33:07.030, Speaker A: I think it's going to take a minute, and so I'm really keen to see how that materializes, but I really couldn't tell you. I think it's a lot of just like, we could sit in here and have a really wonderful conversation over drinks, but practically speaking, I'm not sure what to do with it. I actually don't know much about fully on chain game.
06:33:07.030 - 06:33:23.048, Speaker A: There you go. I just learned it from one of the panelists in another session this lunch just now, who is working very hard on Fully On Chain Game. I think it's the next session, right? So he's right here, so I think you can answer.
06:33:23.048 - 06:33:27.016, Speaker A: He will answer better than I do. I just learning from him. Cure.
06:33:27.016 - 06:33:36.408, Speaker A: All right. All right, that will be all of the topics for today. And thanks every guest and hope the audience enjoying.
06:33:36.408 - 06:33:45.872, Speaker A: And also, thanks seven X for making putting us together. Thanks, folks. Thank you.
06:33:45.872 - 06:33:53.584, Speaker A: Thank you all, the panelists and the moderator. And if you still want to hear something about gaming, no worries. We still have a gaming panel.
06:33:53.584 - 06:34:12.330, Speaker A: And for this new panel, we have GM from Dragonfly as the moderator, and we have Brandon from AI Arena, IDA from Curio, david from Blockworks, and Majo from Matrix as the panelists. So it's time to hear more about gaming. Let's give a warm welcome to them.
06:34:12.330 - 06:34:55.126, Speaker A: It what are we missing? Treasure Dove. All right, cool. Let's get started.
06:34:55.126 - 06:35:12.730, Speaker A: So thanks, everyone. This is the second gaming panel, and we have this great opportunity to have with us a couple of really talented builders, really building, kind of defining the next generation of web three games. So before you get started, very brief self intro.
06:35:12.730 - 06:35:18.206, Speaker A: My name is GM. I'm a partner at Dragonfly Dragonfly. We are a global crypto venture fund.
06:35:18.206 - 06:35:27.534, Speaker A: And I would like to go around the table and ask everyone to introduce who you are and what you're building. Hi, everyone. My name is EJA.
06:35:27.534 - 06:35:39.720, Speaker A: I'm one of the co founders for Curio Research. We are a on chain game company, hybrid game, and infrastructure company pioneering the space of on chain games. So hopefully we'll get a lot of questions there.
06:35:39.720 - 06:35:56.014, Speaker A: Yeah, our first commercial game will come live early next year. It's a social diplomacy strategy game. Hello.
06:35:56.014 - 06:36:00.830, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. My name is Brandon. I'm the CEO and CTO of AI Arena.
06:36:00.830 - 06:36:28.754, Speaker A: We're making a PvP platform fighting game where the core loop is actually to train an AI to fight on behalf of you. Hello, everyone. This is madeira, co founder of our Matrix, and we are striving to deliver a trilogy game, or multi Epson games with Unified Worldview Story essentially focused on hundreds of years of a war between centralized data Cartil and decentralized resident chips.
06:36:28.754 - 06:36:49.280, Speaker A: And we want to use this kind of a trilogy game to prove the transferability and interoperability of MFT technologies at the same time. Meantime, we will encourage the creator economy based on the community governance and to share the revenue stream with the current co creators. Thank you.
06:36:49.280 - 06:36:55.758, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm David Johansson. I'm co founder and CEO of Medaking Studios.
06:36:55.758 - 06:37:14.102, Speaker A: We're working on a game called Block Lords. Block Lords is a medieval MMO grant strategy game designed essentially around creating a medieval life for any user. You start off as a farmer, you gather resources, you grow in power, you build armies, you attack each other.
06:37:14.102 - 06:37:30.140, Speaker A: At the top of the funnel you have lords. The lords collect taxes from players who farm on their lands and go to war against each other. And then it's all tied around the dynasty system where heroes actually die and you need to get married and have children to keep your legacy going.
06:37:30.140 - 06:37:57.670, Speaker A: So before we kick start with the conversation, I'd like to really kind of hear how would you define the term web three gaming like in your own opinion? Because I feel like it's oftentimes very overloaded term, especially for Yija. We've heard there's a lot of discussions for fully on chain games. So I would also for you to take the chance to make the case for fully on chain games, which I believe might be how you would define web three games.
06:37:57.670 - 06:38:19.690, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. I think generally my take is that there are different levels in which a game can use web three. And crypto, I think the lowest or using in the least sense would be having assets on chain, which is the majority of crypto games that we've seen.
06:38:19.690 - 06:38:40.894, Speaker A: I think one level above that you can have some part of the logic on chain. A lot of games have some of that part of their logic on chain, whereas the quest system or some other peripheral system is off chain. And then one level above that you can have all of the logic that is using the blockchain as the server.
06:38:40.894 - 06:38:52.406, Speaker A: So all the logic and state happens on chain. And I can talk about briefly about the benefits. So the benefits that we recognize are two.
06:38:52.406 - 06:39:21.610, Speaker A: The first one is really the security and trust for players. Right? So if you have a game world that contains a lot of value, let's say players have staked in tens of thousands or millions of dollars worth of asset. If you have a game mechanism where PvP happens, or even PvE happens, I would argue where the probability actually can affect the end result, then having logic on chain is a great way to convince players to participate.
06:39:21.610 - 06:39:49.270, Speaker A: Right, so that's the first I can elaborate and then the second big use case that we've discovered or observed and discovered is the ability to use smart contracts to express social relations and interactions in especially MMO type of worlds. And yeah, I'll elaborate on those later. But those are the two things that we're most bullish in when it comes to fully on chain logic, on chain games.
06:39:49.270 - 06:40:33.974, Speaker A: So I think that's the pinnacle of web three gaming, we don't do it to that extent. Our main focus is on using web three as a structure for aligning incentives better, specifically on distributing rewards globally on a larger scale as well as value accrual in certain assets, which I can talk about how we do it later. To us, creator economy is the most essential part and also the community governance because in order for a game to be sustainable and for the next ten to 20 years, we should not depend only on the developers themselves, but also on the efforts of the community.
06:40:33.974 - 06:41:17.406, Speaker A: So we have to try all of our best efforts to incentivize the creator economy. Of course, the web two gaming community and developers talked a lot about the creator economy too, but lacks of such tool undesigned to really develop our creator economy. So blockchain as well alongside with the crypto economy, I think one of the best incentives really to incentivize the creative economy so that from the very beginning you could have used kind of a centralized way in order to lay down the very groundwork, the framework for the whole community system.
06:41:17.406 - 06:41:55.578, Speaker A: And later on you could just make the whole system little by little more decentralized and ultimately to hand over all the governance and decision making of the new content, including the new maps, dungeons and avatars and gameplays and also worldview stories. You could hand over those decision making rights back to the gamers, to the creators, to the community. And in order to achieve these, you could just create this kind of ecosystem involving all of the community members to try to make all of these Afloats.
06:41:55.578 - 06:42:19.022, Speaker A: And this is a fair game. And I think maybe in five to ten years maybe we should not still talk about the web three game because this is the feature of the game. So we should not differentiate anymore between web two games and web three games because all of the games should have these convert features.
06:42:19.022 - 06:42:30.218, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, I agree with a lot of what's been said. I think definitely there are some obvious reasons to like web three.
06:42:30.218 - 06:42:41.354, Speaker A: One is asset ownership. Your wallet, your assets, you control them, you can sell them, you can transfer them, you can burn them. Whatever you want to do, you can do it as long as it's on chain.
06:42:41.354 - 06:43:06.310, Speaker A: And then definitely as much as we like to hide it, the access to liquidity is important. It is important that you as a player, your experience, your assets, your tokens, whatever you do inside of game. If that asset has access to a liquidity pool or to a market of some sort, that is going to create an additional layer of incentives for users.
06:43:06.310 - 06:43:24.554, Speaker A: That said, while we do think those two parts are extremely important, we also think that the actual protocol or the back end or the solution that you're building the web three elements of your game on are not that important for most users. Most gamers just want to play a game. They want to be entertained.
06:43:24.554 - 06:43:53.042, Speaker A: They want to stay in the game and become part of the community as long as possible. So as we were building our infrastructure, our portal as we call it, we wanted to make sure that users could play the game as frictionless as possible, and then when they were ready, they could then mint their assets on the chain of their choice. So currently we support Immutable, we support Polygon, but the idea is to not lock in the user into one specific protocol.
06:43:53.042 - 06:44:16.778, Speaker A: It's really to give them access to wherever they want to go, wherever there are users, wherever there are liquidity. The game is just a tool to get their asset where they want it. So I've had a couple of conversations and I realized there are a lot of folks, obviously, who's kind of on the fence and observing Web three gaming and would love to hear all of you guys'story.
06:44:16.778 - 06:44:36.580, Speaker A: What drew you into Web three gaming and is there a particular moment, is there a particular game that really clicked for you and solidified your conviction? Here's what I want to build. Is there any stories? I believe the audience would love to hear the stories for each one of you. I can start.
06:44:36.580 - 06:44:53.754, Speaker A: I got into crypto in 2017 as a retail investor. I bought some bitcoin, fell in love with it, got some ethereum, started understanding smart contracts. When I got into, I knew I was already a game developer, so I knew gaming and crypto would be the perfect match.
06:44:53.754 - 06:45:09.082, Speaker A: Gamers love managing their resources, finding the optimal yield. I came from strategy games as well, so just this idea of, okay, tokenized assets and gamers made perfect sense. So for me, when it clicked was really when Dnft was invented.
06:45:09.082 - 06:45:18.738, Speaker A: I played CryptoKitties, made some cats, and I was like, okay, I'm going all in. And I started my studio a few months later. Thank you.
06:45:18.738 - 06:45:59.726, Speaker A: Yeah. I also entered into this sector since 2017, and especially when listening to a speech of industry OG, very famous in Shanghai in January 2017 and also participating several very high profile ICO got very good financial return. But I think CryptoKitties really opens the way for us to realize that there's not just a financial speculation in this sector, but also you could just create some kind of an open end economy like CryptoKitties and crypto hats, especially in that.
06:45:59.726 - 06:46:13.940, Speaker A: When we look through the success of CryptoKitties, you will see another company called crypto hats to create those hats for those kitties. And this really forms a very complete ecosystem. And this is just the first try.
06:46:13.940 - 06:46:30.614, Speaker A: The second try is of course the rise, the stellar rise of the X Infinity one. Our strategic investor, our seed run investor. Hannah just told me to draft a strategy for them to be fully invested in Metaverse.
06:46:30.614 - 06:46:57.418, Speaker A: And I said at that time, two years ago, to invest heavily in IPS and arbitrary technologies. However, we found that gaming was very important in monetizing these heavy assets and also producing recurring cash flows. But if you want to dive into deeply into the web two gaming economy, we will find it very difficult for startup to succeed.
06:46:57.418 - 06:47:59.282, Speaker A: However, we found that web three investors or web three traders users are extremely high net worth individuals compared to those web two users. So for gaming studio even though you don't believe ultimately in decentralization there are a lot of people in this industry we have to admit that they don't believe in the ultimate decentralization but still it is a better market much better market compared to web two markets to start in terms of a startup studio so much higher chance to succeed and that's why we choose to start from the web three gaming industry, especially in that we really want to promote the very native industry values such as data integrity, decentralization and privacy protection. However, not through those kind of words and mouth propaganda, but from the distribution of our gamings and accountants and movies, et cetera.
06:47:59.282 - 06:48:41.362, Speaker A: In this way we think it's much more likely to promote this kind of industry native value and content to the people in the worldwide. And also I think the most exciting moment for me in this sector is in January 2022 one extremely high network archer high net worth individual asking me for the progress of the blockchain industry because he remains always skeptical since years about the progress of this industry because he only believed in those killer apps. When I told him about the latest progress of stepping, he becomes so excited about that.
06:48:41.362 - 06:49:09.818, Speaker A: And three days later he told me that he thought there is really high chance that this industry could succeed. And also last summer when I had the chance to dinner together with Vitalika Butter in the Chinese restaurants in Mountain View, we asked him what exactly could blockchain do other than just facilitating financial transactions and financial speculation? And he said at first moments he did not know. He did not have any idea.
06:49:09.818 - 06:49:28.978, Speaker A: But he added that the next thing could probably be gaming. Thank you. For me it wasn't necessarily looking at another game it was just understanding what NFTs were that really made it click.
06:49:28.978 - 06:49:43.346, Speaker A: Bit of background I used to be a quant. I used to lead machine learning at a fund and when I really dug into NFTs I realized they're just these digital containers for anything that's unique and has value. And it kind of clicked.
06:49:43.346 - 06:50:02.106, Speaker A: I was like, oh, the thing that I make that's unique and has value is these machine learning models. So let me try and tokenize AI. And I thought an excellent use case because on my spare time I used to build machine learning algorithms for games was to basically create a game for AIS to compete against each other.
06:50:02.106 - 06:50:36.280, Speaker A: And it had to be PvP because I think I mentioned before, web Three is great for creating these things for value accrual, right? And if you want to prove the value of this thing, this machine learning algorithm versus another one, let's have them compete against each other and you can see which one's the better one, you know what I mean? So that's kind of how it started. And games have the added benefit of abstracting away complexity. So if we wanted a lot of people to use this, we needed a way for not everyone to kind of be intimidated by a lot of the machine learning, like lingo and stuff like that.
06:50:36.280 - 06:51:01.466, Speaker A: So in April 2022, I left my previous company where I was leading the tech back end and I was pretty lost, honestly, about life. And I went to a Buddhist monastery for a week and learned my, like wrote my first lines of Solidity and read proof of stake papers. And there was not one moment there's several moments.
06:51:01.466 - 06:51:14.498, Speaker A: So first was seeing things like Axi get a lot of usage and Hype back in July 2022. And then it was Dark Forest. Dark Forest was a huge one.
06:51:14.498 - 06:51:28.674, Speaker A: So I believe the Round Six started in September. October. There was a huge amount of plugins compared to the actual active players of Dark Force.
06:51:28.674 - 06:51:54.094, Speaker A: So Dark Force was like the first fully on chain game MMORTS where players basically conquered planets and hold an empire. And the game is super interesting, right? Nobody thought that Ethereum or EVM can support such a complex game. It's not that complex, but still a fairly complex game and that many people will contribute code and plugins to it.
06:51:54.094 - 06:52:23.338, Speaker A: This ratio is the highest I've seen, even compared to some of the mod heavy games in traditional games. Now, there were also issues, right? There were so many people that were talking about Dark Forest, but the daily active players were like never exceeding a thousand if I believe correctly. And lots of people were just saying, god, I can't play this game even though I want to, right? The command line interface, the non intuitive, just like game rules, a lot of the UX issues.
06:52:23.338 - 06:52:47.358, Speaker A: And then also actually, if you dig deep into the plugins, the game plugins, most of them are on the front end level, they're on the client level. And if you think about it, that's not really unique to Web Three, right? Like if a Web Two game, there are plenty of good Web Two games that are open source. I can't remember, there's like the game that's anyways, that are open source and players can write plugins on the front end.
06:52:47.358 - 06:52:58.206, Speaker A: The real interesting thing should be allowing players to change or build to extend the rules on the contract side. But very few people are doing that. So me and my co founders start asking why, right.
06:52:58.206 - 06:53:22.140, Speaker A: Or how can we improve Web Three on chain games so that it makes it easier for people to extend the game logic in interesting ways that enhance players experience. And how do we actually lower the barrier for more people to come in? Right? I think a lot of people think of onchain games as like a very niche thing, right. We have those questions and we thought we are pretty good engineers, so let's give it a try.
06:53:22.140 - 06:53:47.794, Speaker A: Everything I talked about, 22, it's actually 2021 starting in January 2022. We started to build demos of onchain games and then full games afterwards. It does sound like a lot of us got really inspired by Axie Stefan, a lot of the prior the games that launched earlier.
06:53:47.794 - 06:54:26.466, Speaker A: And I feel like also chatting with a lot of audiences back in the day when there's market euphoria, right, people always cheered and almost everyone thought, hey, Web Three, gaming is the future of gaming. But I do think right now in this environment, people are starting to question themselves and having second guesses. So I do want to for every panelist to share kind of and kind of make the case for yourself what kind of crypto primitives you're using in your game.
06:54:26.466 - 06:54:51.754, Speaker A: That you're uniquely leveraging that crypto primitive to give and provide a user experience that's truly unique to crypto, that otherwise you wouldn't have achieved that if you were to build your game on a Web Two stack. So I think that would help the audience better understand truly the value of what we're all trying to build here. Yeah, I'll go.
06:54:51.754 - 06:55:04.814, Speaker A: For us, it's really the Hero Dynasty system. In Block Lords, every hero is an NFT, can be minted as an NFT. That hero will have their own stats, it'll have its own look.
06:55:04.814 - 06:55:15.518, Speaker A: They're all AA 3D models, fully animated. They all have a family banner which is like their family symbol. They're really beautiful pieces of artwork.
06:55:15.518 - 06:55:40.200, Speaker A: And because they have a limited lifespan, it becomes very important that you get married inside the game and have children. Right. So this Dynasty building element is really enhanced by Web Three because you do have games like Crusader Kings and a few more strategy games where your heroes do die, but it's very easy to recreate a save or to kind of take that character, put them into another game.
06:55:40.200 - 06:55:53.818, Speaker A: But with the Web Three element, what we have is really the memory of your hero still solidified in the NFT. So even when your hero die, you do have the dead NFT that's going to be usable inside of the game. You're going to be.
06:55:53.818 - 06:56:07.662, Speaker A: Able to stake it inside of the game. And our goal is actually in five to ten years is you're going to be able to take all your dead NFTs from the Block Lords universe and actually use them to play a new game where the dead heroes are all revived. So that's definitely one of our elements.
06:56:07.662 - 06:56:17.630, Speaker A: We call it Hero permadeth. That makes our game pretty unique in the web Three front. Well in our gaming ecosystem.
06:56:17.630 - 06:57:33.038, Speaker A: The NFT are one of the essential parts in that all of the NFTs, especially those Genesis Avatars and all of the weapon skins, they could be carried forward and backwards across the three axis of our game, sharing the same word V stories because users gamers would like to really to play across those games and maybe more likely in the future, some partners, some content providers could just ask us to distribute the content for them and we would ask them to also to share their gameplay with our NFT holders too. So that is to prove the transferability and interoperability of the NFT and also in order to activate our creative economy system and especially this community governance in the decision making process of the new contents. Our governance token system is also essential part in deciding which kind of a map, which kind of a dungeon and what ends what outcomes of our heroes graph could become in the future.
06:57:33.038 - 06:57:51.438, Speaker A: And that is totally in the hands the decision making is totally in the hands of the community members but not in the hands of developers. Personally, I love a lot the Marvel movie series. I don't like the end that the Iron Man is already dead.
06:57:51.438 - 06:58:09.800, Speaker A: So I think for a thousand times that if this is really in the hands of the community, iron man should never be dead. Thank you. So I think the biggest thing is allowing gamers to monetize in a very different way.
06:58:09.800 - 06:58:34.970, Speaker A: I've mentioned a lot of times this value accrual in the NFT concept. But really what we're doing is so we're using machine learning so that the NFT acquires the skills of the user and you can do some really cool stuff like that for one is like it's a competitive game. So if it truly is really good at competing, the gamer can actually monetize by selling this thing because it battles autonomously.
06:58:34.970 - 06:58:54.070, Speaker A: But you can do a lot of other stuff too. You can actually license out the ability to use it as a training partner. The analogies like imagine LeBron James was able to get a bunch of robots, teach it how to play ball and then he can send those out to various people that they can use to then coach and get better at playing basketball.
06:58:54.070 - 06:59:18.026, Speaker A: So by basically allowing us to capture their skill set on chain and this thing can act autonomously, they can monetize in a lot of really cool ways that they couldn't in web two because the financial rails are awful. Yeah. I'm going to elaborate on the two points I mentioned earlier, which are the two biggest reasons why I think players will be attracted to onchain games.
06:59:18.026 - 06:59:49.990, Speaker A: Specifically, the first is high stake competition. So I believe on chain, games provide the best type of arena for players who are looking to compete with other players fairly and verifiably with a lot of stake. If you, let's say, play StarCraft or if you play Dota today in real life, you either kind of compete, you kind of start a pool with friends and compete there like under the shadow or you participate in esports and compete for millions of dollars.
06:59:49.990 - 07:00:03.958, Speaker A: There's really nothing in between. And really game companies, it kind of hurts for both gamers and game companies because companies don't benefit from the takeaway from the players competition. And obviously players derive much less fun from playing these games.
07:00:03.958 - 07:00:24.974, Speaker A: Think of fun playing poker without money, for example. Right. And I think on chain games is a way to bootstrap new types of games that are suitable to these high stake competition environment and genre, right? Like we won't be limited to just poker and Majang and Wolf game and these very limited genre of games.
07:00:24.974 - 07:00:49.894, Speaker A: We can have games that actually feel like games, RTS, FPS, whatever you name it, in a very fair and highly competitive environment with a lot of stake. So that's something that on chain. And why does it have to be logic on chain? Because logic on chain really means the assets are governed not only held on chain, right? The rules around changing metadata, changing hands of the assets are all on chain, which means they're verifiable.
07:00:49.894 - 07:01:03.290, Speaker A: That's the first. And the second is a bit down the line. But also, I think maybe potentially more important is the ability to craft arbitrary social interactions in a way that the game engine understands.
07:01:03.290 - 07:01:46.810, Speaker A: So I analogize this as kind of to the real world law enforcement layer, right? We already have digital assets which are comparable to real world assets. They're very valuable, people care about them, they don't want to lose their NFTs. So now if we look at traditional multiplayer games, how do players interact with each other? They're often limited to the game company's social model or the social model that the game company forced them to participate in, right? Whether it's like pure competition in StarCraft or pure alliances in things like games like Rise of Kingdoms or World of Warcraft, these type of games, there's nothing between collaboration and cooperation.
07:01:46.810 - 07:02:02.942, Speaker A: Typically there's very few exceptions. Evolve. Online is like kind of an exception, though not really in web three games and eventually like on chain MMOs, what we'll see are emergent social organizations in the form of smart contracts acting as social contracts.
07:02:02.942 - 07:02:29.754, Speaker A: This we've already validated with our game that launched this January called Treaty, which allowed it's a forex game that allowed people to essentially draft off social contracts like non aggression pact, embargo pact. And that goes into effect, the game engine, right? Because smart contracts automatically get executed and they tied to your NFTs, to your tokens. When the virtual world becomes more complex, this piece gets infinitely more important and interesting.
07:02:29.754 - 07:02:52.530, Speaker A: Think of like the real world without the corporate laws, for example, we wouldn't be here, right? We wouldn't be doing so many interesting things. And that's, I think, one of the biggest unlocks of fully on chain games. So we've all kind of discussed the promised land, the bright side of hey.
07:02:52.530 - 07:03:34.880, Speaker A: Using and building web three games really enables in each of your cases like a unique experience for your users. And what about the downsides? So I think because the reason I want to ask that is because there's also a lot of infrastructure builders today with us and I think they would take a lot of inspirations hearing from hey during your development, the process of building a web three game. Which part of the tech stack you are most frustrated with and are there anything that you wish you could see improvements on that would make your lives easier? Everything I can start.
07:03:34.880 - 07:03:53.880, Speaker A: There are a lot of pieces of a lot of components of the tech that we're dissatisfied with. Number one is just as fully on chain games. Probably unique to us, the back end engine or the engine as people call it in onchain game space.
07:03:53.880 - 07:04:20.826, Speaker A: Really, the key problem is that the most popular VMs, like EVM, StarkNet, Solana, these VMs are not made for games, right? They don't have built in parallelization, they don't have gametic. There's a lack of game libraries and typically have very bad performance if you want to build relatively fast games, multiplayer games. So that's why we built Keystone.
07:04:20.826 - 07:04:45.080, Speaker A: It's really a piece of infrastructure that allows us to patch the problem there and to build actually fast games while maintaining the composability and the verifiability. And then a problem that probably is shared among a lot of our projects is like the onboarding user experience, the wallets, the cross chain, all that kind of stuff. So I'll leave you guys to it because a lot of you have launched already.
07:04:45.080 - 07:05:03.046, Speaker A: Yeah, I can add to that. So one thing about the tech that's really frustrating, still very frustrating, is initially I wanted to store the neural networks on chain. It was feasible when the game was a lot simpler and you had small neural networks.
07:05:03.046 - 07:05:17.246, Speaker A: Obviously as we started making the game more complex, that's not feasible. It took like 20 transactions to push one neural network on chain and if users are constantly updating, it's just not feasible. So then we put it on IPFS.
07:05:17.246 - 07:05:45.290, Speaker A: That's also not great because when we just push it to IPFS, it takes like 15 minutes to retrieve and users can't actually use the model. So we're forced to have redundancies and just basically pull the model from our own centralized databases. So those are some of the annoying things like you said, onboarding, in addition to just the tech for onboarding, just a lot of web two gamers, as soon as they hear web Three, they just run away, even if they like the game.
07:05:45.290 - 07:06:08.718, Speaker A: So that's a big difficulty. Well, there are a lot of difficulties in developing and especially in promoting a very successful web Three games because you have to attract not only those web Three users, but also those web Two gamers. But most important issue I think is still the issue of the gas fees.
07:06:08.718 - 07:06:35.254, Speaker A: Because this is really counterintuitive to convince a gamer to play your game. But before playing your game, or before transferring his NFTs, before accessing your game, he still has to pay some kind of a gas fees. It's not about the cost of the gas fee, whether it's high or low, even it is extremely low, it is still counterintuitive that he has to pay something upfront.
07:06:35.254 - 07:06:59.102, Speaker A: So it is really counter natural. But we understand that get fee is also very important in making the whole network efficient and also making that safe. But we are looking for ways really to solve this issue with all potential partners, especially in that we know that there are a lot of side chain solutions and also layer two solutions.
07:06:59.102 - 07:07:36.282, Speaker A: But the thing, the issue is that more than 80% of total transaction volumes of the whole Ft market are generated by VIP clients and institutional players, not by retail. So retail constitute represent around 95% of the total transaction number of the Ft market, but less than 20% of the total transaction volumes. That is to say, in order to make your gaming economy sustainable, you have to really identify and attract those VIPs, those high net worth individuals and institution players to come to access your game and to trade your NFTs.
07:07:36.282 - 07:08:07.110, Speaker A: But these kind of people, I think most of them are still in the main nets, not in layer two, not in side chains. So if some chain solution providers could really attract these kind of highness was individuals, I think they were attracting most of the users and most popular games to too. And also if someone could really provide a solution to decrease significantly those gas fees in the main net, I think there's a great solution too.
07:08:07.110 - 07:08:16.070, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, I agree with everything that's been said. There are a lot of challenges on the technical side on making sure everything's synced.
07:08:16.070 - 07:08:37.410, Speaker A: On the community side, there are a lot of issues as well. You end up with a player base whose main purpose with playing your game is profits rather than just having fun, which does also create issues when you're trying to build a healthy, thriving community. But on top of it, I think at the end of the day, the biggest problem is distribution.
07:08:37.410 - 07:08:56.978, Speaker A: When you look at platforms like Steam being completely turned off for games, that does become a problem because that's where most of the PC market is, right? Same with Apple, Google. But the good part is we're starting to see that shift, right. For our self block lords.
07:08:56.978 - 07:09:03.254, Speaker A: We're on Epic Game Store. We're actually going live with our open beta in the coming week. Please wish list, please play it.
07:09:03.254 - 07:09:31.406, Speaker A: But I think this is what we're also going to see in the next few years is we're going to see way more games trying or maybe even succeeding in going on Steam. We're going to see more users being drawn into those via those mainstream platform, into trying Web Three elements of games, whether it's NFTs, whether it's Tokens, whether it's just the back end. And hopefully within a few years we can start moving towards a world where people aren't scared of the word Web Three or NFT like they were with Creator League.
07:09:31.406 - 07:09:45.560, Speaker A: Right. And there are going to be some projects where it literally doesn't matter. And yeah, in the future, as it's been said before, it's not going to matter if it's Web Two or Web Three, it's just going to be a game and there's going to be liquidity and it's whether you want to access it or not.
07:09:45.560 - 07:10:13.440, Speaker A: I want to add a small piece to the distribution point you brought up, which is like where you put the first paywall to players. Right. It's actually a very tough decision for web three, typically, because if you put it before all the players, all the experience, then you risk losing a lot of players before they even try your game, where if you put them after some experience, then you fear that they won't buy your NFTs because they already kind of try out the game.
07:10:13.440 - 07:10:36.302, Speaker A: So yeah, that's also a challenge I think faced by a lot of games. So one last thing before we wrap it up. Unfortunately we're running out of time, but what's new in your guys'pipeline? Where can people find you? Are there any exciting updates that people should be looking forward to? Sure, I can start.
07:10:36.302 - 07:10:52.926, Speaker A: So yeah, we're building our first game, as I mentioned earlier, it won't be just a proof of concept like before, which we've done twice. The game is in Alpha development and we will launch the game beginning of next year. And the best way to follow us would be on Twitter.
07:10:52.926 - 07:11:03.906, Speaker A: It's zero Xql for those of you game developers. We're also building Keystone, which is very specific. It's basically an infrastack for building on chain games.
07:11:03.906 - 07:11:35.322, Speaker A: Basically helps you connect the logic to the blockchain or build the logic in an interoperable way with the EVM, and also to have the infrastructure where players can verify the game progression. So if you're interested in using or contributing, definitely check it out or talk to me as well in terms of updates. Yeah, we're actively doing play tests, so if you're interested in testing out the game, you can follow us on Twitter and join our discord.
07:11:35.322 - 07:11:56.998, Speaker A: As soon as you join our discord, you can just hit up one of the mods, say, I want to try it out, and then they'll pipe you into a funnel that we have for people that want to try out the game. And eventually you can enter our competitions. We have competitions on a frequent basis where if you place in the top 10%, we actually just give out our NFTs.
07:11:56.998 - 07:12:29.374, Speaker A: So, yeah, check us out. Well, as one of the most popular games in this universe, our first episode of Matrix File is essentially mobile IPS game CS Go style. And we just finished the second loss scale online test, the alpha test, and got tremendous results, tremendous success with more than 200,000 registered users and more than 100,000 downloads.
07:12:29.374 - 07:12:54.086, Speaker A: And we will probably launch the beta test, the loss test before the official launch during Q Four this year. And the official launch is due around the end of this year or the debut of next year. And also the Battle Royal parts of our game, that is to say the PUBG Star game is also already under developments and probably before the end of next year you will see the PUBG Star game alpha Matrix File.
07:12:54.086 - 07:13:00.922, Speaker A: Thank you. And as mentioned, Block Lords is going on the Epic game store this week. So please wish list download.
07:13:00.922 - 07:13:12.442, Speaker A: The game will be free. There's dozens of resources to know, dozens of squad to choose from. We're going to have Bears attack you so you can go and truly live out your fantasies of killing a bear.
07:13:12.442 - 07:13:20.258, Speaker A: That's the reason I made the game and a free NFT hero to anybody who plays. So please come join the Block Lords universe. Awesome.
07:13:20.258 - 07:13:23.620, Speaker A: Thank you so much. A round of applause for our panelists. Thank you.
07:13:23.620 - 07:13:56.830, Speaker A: Thank you all our panelists for gaming. And now it's keynote session again and we're super honored to have Shirem as our final keynote speaker. Talking about augmenting the Iframe role of stack with Share security.
07:13:56.830 - 07:14:10.144, Speaker A: Let's welcome. Good evening everybody. I'm Sriram, pleasure to be here.
07:14:10.144 - 07:14:23.432, Speaker A: Thanks to the Savonics team for inviting me here and thanks to you all for staying late in the evening to listen to this talk. So, a brief introduction. I'm Sriram, founder of Eigen Layer, having a professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, where I'm the UW Blockchain Research Lab.
07:14:23.432 - 07:14:45.344, Speaker A: Today I'm going to talk about how we can use Eigen Layer to augment the Ethereum rollup stack. Awesome. So we know a bit about roll ups, right? Roll ups augment move execution off chain and move computation and memory off chain.
07:14:45.344 - 07:15:02.776, Speaker A: And this is a scaling strategy for Ethereum. But there still remains many roadblocks in order to get layer twos and roll ups to the end state. What are they? The first one is the data bandwidth of Ethereum is very, very low, 83 kb/second.
07:15:02.776 - 07:15:21.740, Speaker A: That's the data bandwidth of the entire Ethereum blockchain. If you don't use Ethereum for any computation, just write data to Ethereum. And this is a very important function that roll ups do because roll ups still need to publish the inputs or outputs of their computation onto the Ethereum blockchain.
07:15:21.740 - 07:15:33.884, Speaker A: The finalization time is very slow. Twelve minutes to finality. And finality is very important because if I want to move information from one roll up to another roll up the rollup needs to finalize.
07:15:33.884 - 07:16:20.156, Speaker A: On Ethereum, roll ups still rely on single node sequences a single node which orders transactions in order to get fast censorship resistance. The Bridging experience inside rollups as well as between Ethereum rollups and outside chains leaves much to be desired. And finally, how do we utilize the altering freedom called mev or minor extractable value or maximal extractable value? How do we manage this properly so that users get maximal benefit? So how we view this is eigen Layer provides a comprehensive base layer solution to go and augment the Ethereum roadmap.
07:16:20.156 - 07:16:57.436, Speaker A: So any of these problems can then be built on top of Ethereum Shad security. How do we get to Ethereum shad security? Ethereum security occurs because stakers stake ETH deposit it into the ethereum contracts and then promise that they will validate Ethereum correctly. What happens with Eigen Layer is we enhance the functionality from just staking where you take your stake and then lock it up onto Ethereum to now expand it to promise any other protocol building on top be it an Oracle, data availability, a bridge, mev management any of these things.
07:16:57.436 - 07:17:43.720, Speaker A: We call these actively validated services anything that requires active validation and decentralized service you basically can build them on top of Eigen Layer. What you do is, as a staker you promise that you not only promise your ETH that you will validate the Ethereum blocks correctly but you also promise that you validate all these other systems correctly otherwise you may be liable to lose your ETH. So when you're building an ABS, an actively validated service any one of these things an Oracle, a bridge or any of these things what you're building is an off chain container which basically lets you run any arbitrary program and an onchain contract which basically does some of the core management registration payments and slashing.
07:17:43.720 - 07:18:00.080, Speaker A: So that's what eigen layer is. It's a system of contracts on Ethereum but it broadens who the stakers can supply their security to instead of only the core protocol. Now, any other protocol which is restaked can also obtain the security from each staking.
07:18:00.080 - 07:18:17.060, Speaker A: So what can you do with this? You can actually go and build new modules which then address the problems that I laid out earlier. For example, the data availability problem. You can build a data availability service on Eigen layer which then solves this problem.
07:18:17.060 - 07:18:44.912, Speaker A: We are ourselves building Eigenda a data availability service which actually has very high throughput and provides data availability guarantees. You can start building Mev Management Solutions or Super Fast Settlement Solutions where a lot of stake underwrites your settlement guarantees or decentralized sequencing, or low latency bridging any of these different kinds of features on top of Eigen layer. It doesn't mean we will build all these things.
07:18:44.912 - 07:18:52.748, Speaker A: We won't. We want other people. And we are partnering with a lot of different projects to be building all these different kinds of services on Eigen layer.
07:18:52.748 - 07:19:16.596, Speaker A: Okay? So in the next few minutes, what I'll do is give a quick overview of Eigenda, which is our Data Availability service, and then hint a little bit about what other services are being built on Eigen layer. So when you're thinking about a Data Availability layer, first I want to lay out what properties do we want from a Data Availability layer? We want high bandwidth. When I talk about high bandwidth, we call it hyperscale.
07:19:16.596 - 07:19:29.740, Speaker A: Hyperscale means if there are N nodes, each of them have a certain bandwidth. You want to be almost as performant as N times C. If each node has C bandwidth, low cost, you don't want.
07:19:29.740 - 07:19:39.120, Speaker A: Right now the cost of Data availability is every node has to download and store data. This is really, really expensive. In Ethereum there are 500,000 virtual nodes.
07:19:39.120 - 07:19:59.824, Speaker A: So this can become very, very expensive. What you want is actually to be almost similar to one node downloading and storing data that's what would be low cost, low latency should be very similar to. Like when you send an AWS query, goes to the server, comes back two times, or the round trip latency, you want it to be verifiable.
07:19:59.824 - 07:20:10.728, Speaker A: When the system's running outside nodes should be able to check that the system is working correctly. This is the property that many other Data Availability system exclusively focus on. And finally customizability.
07:20:10.728 - 07:20:37.280, Speaker A: Customizability means the Data Availability layer should be adaptable to different nodes which want different safety, liveness trade offs, different staking tokens, different kinds of erasure codes, all kinds of different things. Eigenda is a Data Availability System which achieves all these properties. How does it work? Here are the Ethereum restakers who opt into Eigen layer and opt into Eigenda on top of Eigen layer.
07:20:37.280 - 07:20:59.704, Speaker A: What do they do when a sequencer for a rollup? Remember that Eigenda is a Data Availability service that rollups naturally use. Rollups have a node called a sequencer which orders all the transactions and then writes some state to Ethereum. And when they write the state to Ethereum, what they do in addition now is they create an erasure code using the package that we give them.
07:20:59.704 - 07:21:21.548, Speaker A: And this erasure code is built on KZG polynomial cryptography, which is what underpins Dank Sharding, which is on the Ethereum roadmap. And they take a data blob and they take this blob and then encode it into many small chunks. Each chunk here in the picture is much smaller than the data blob and that's precisely how the data is encoded.
07:21:21.548 - 07:21:33.664, Speaker A: Each of them send these chunks to each of these nodes. Each node downloads something which is roughly one Nth if there are N nodes the size of the whole data. So that's what each node downloads.
07:21:33.664 - 07:21:52.060, Speaker A: They sign off on this thing saying that, yes, I downloaded and received the right chunk. They get a proof that they got the right chunk through the KZG encoding. They send these signatures back to the sequencer, the sequencer aggregates all these signatures and then sends it to the eigenda contracts on ethereum.
07:21:52.060 - 07:22:10.384, Speaker A: So what's happening is, on ethereum there is a record that a data corresponding to this data commitment has been stored on eigenda and certified. And there is an incentive mechanism which keeps the nodes honest. Okay? So that's the high level of how Eigenda works.
07:22:10.384 - 07:22:24.180, Speaker A: And I'll give you a little bit of insight into how we designed eigenda. It's designed to optimize the cost basis of operation. And if you think about the cost basis of a system like eigenda, there are many contributors to it.
07:22:24.180 - 07:22:41.236, Speaker A: So there's capital cost, which is you have to stake. So if you're staking $1 billion, you have to give the users a 10% Apr on this $1 billion, that's $100 million. So how do you optimize capital cost? How do you optimize operating cost? Every node has to download and store data.
07:22:41.236 - 07:22:58.240, Speaker A: How do we optimize that? How do you optimize congestion cost? Every system today is priced on congestion. If you know ethereum EIP 1559, the block price increases based on if there is congestion or not. So congestion is a significant cost and an uncertainty to a roll up.
07:22:58.240 - 07:23:19.204, Speaker A: If you're a roll up, you don't know what the price is going to be tomorrow because maybe Yuga Labs does a board Ape drop and then now you're congested significant problems in the landscape and inds solves all these problems all at one go. How do we do it? The capital cost is solved by Shad Security restaking. You're using the same stake across many applications.
07:23:19.204 - 07:23:36.510, Speaker A: Common stake reduces the capital costs, operating costs, I explained in the last slide, the data, every node doesn't download and store all the data. Every node downloads a little bit of data together they download all the data. The cost basis is very, very low of operating the system.
07:23:36.510 - 07:23:58.276, Speaker A: And finally, to reduce the congestion cost, if you increase the throughput, then you reduce the congestion cost. Not only that, on eigenda there is a mechanism to reserve the amount of space that you want. If you're building a roll up, a gaming roll up, maybe you can come and reserve, I need 20 Kb/second just for my roll up for the next year.
07:23:58.276 - 07:24:15.332, Speaker A: And you pay a much cheaper fee than buying on the spot market because you're reserving a whole bunch of data. So that's how eigenda works. It shaves every single cost basis so that we can actually move to an economy where we can start thinking about moving the cloud traffic on chain.
07:24:15.332 - 07:24:26.652, Speaker A: That's the goal that we have for eigenda. And just to give a quick glimpse of numbers. Eigenda is right now on our private testnet, will be soon on public testnet at ten megabytes per second.
07:24:26.652 - 07:24:37.970, Speaker A: This is much greater than Ethereum right now. And Dank Sharding, which is three years down in the Ethereum roadmap. And we have a roadmap to scale this another thousand x in the coming four years.
07:24:37.970 - 07:24:58.280, Speaker A: We are doing this not by adopting the Salana roadmap of actually having each node download and store a lot. We're actually doing this, achieving this high throughput without each node requiring to have a high node bandwidth requirement. So you have very low node requirement, but very high throughput and a lot of customizability.
07:24:58.280 - 07:25:18.060, Speaker A: I'll check the time to make sure three minutes okay. So I think what I'll do in the remaining three minutes is just point out how Eigen Layer can be used for various other things to solve. For example, the sequencing problem.
07:25:18.060 - 07:25:29.472, Speaker A: Instead of having one sequencer, we can have many sequencers run through the Eigen Layer staking mechanism. Espresso is actually already building a protocol like this on Eigen Layer. You can start building fast.
07:25:29.472 - 07:25:54.040, Speaker A: Settlement layer. Instead of waiting for the twelve minutes on Ethereum or waiting for several hours that STARTnet waits today, you can actually write proofs into an Eigen Layer service which verifies your proofs and then certifies that you've done it correctly. You can start building bridges, many bridges we are in partnerships with which are building fast bridges to move data across various layer twos and layer threes.
07:25:54.040 - 07:26:21.964, Speaker A: You can start building very sophisticated mev management where you don't have to only do auctions, you can do event driven actions, you can do partial block auctions, you can do threshold cryptography, you can do block space features, all of this on Eigen Layer. Going back to the starting point, I pointed out many limitations on the Ethereum modular roadmap data bandwidth is low. We can solve it by building something like Eigenda finalization time is too slow.
07:26:21.964 - 07:26:35.684, Speaker A: You can take a Fast Consensus protocol and throw it on Eigen Layer and you can get super fast finality. You can move from centralized sequences to decentralized sequences using Eigen Layer. You can build very high quality bridges with very high economic security.
07:26:35.684 - 07:26:53.928, Speaker A: And finally you can build modules for doing sophisticated mev management on Eigen Layer. Eigen Layer I just want to summarize that Eigen Layer is a great complement to the modular Ethereum roadmap where any significant features which are missing from Ethereum can be provided by permissionless. Innovation.
07:26:53.928 - 07:27:20.996, Speaker A: Any of us, any of you here coming up with a new idea for how to build this can actually come and patch that particular problem for Ethereum. Our vision is that just like AWS enabled a plethora of software as a service tools to be built and any end user application then concatenates these SaaS services. Eigen Layer enables a decentralized SaaS economy where you can build new decentralized SaaS services and end user applications can.
07:27:20.996 - 07:27:29.850, Speaker A: Just simply concatenate all of these to build users on Ethereum. I think. With that, I'll conclude this talk.
07:27:29.850 - 07:27:40.756, Speaker A: If you're interested, please follow us on our Eigen Layer Twitter handle and on our website. Thank you so much to the Soundx team for organizing this. Thank you, really.
07:27:40.756 - 07:28:00.316, Speaker A: A highlight of our new chance of meet here and next panel is about DeFi. And we have Joy from ABCDE as the moderator, and Daida from Dodo, and Ken from Pando, rick from Games, jasper from Panoptic, and Marat from GSR as the panelists. Yeah, it's our final panelists.
07:28:00.316 - 07:28:35.180, Speaker A: Also, thank you again for staying so long. Also, I would like to remind the people in the back to keep your voice low, to be polite, and also get ready for our final panel right now. It moderator thingy.
07:28:35.180 - 07:29:24.922, Speaker A: All right. Hey, everyone. I know this is a super long day, but I hope you enjoy all the panels here today.
07:29:24.922 - 07:29:36.622, Speaker A: We have a lot of panelists here. How about before we start a session, please give a little bit of short introduction of yourself as well as your project. Hi, everyone.
07:29:36.622 - 07:29:58.990, Speaker A: I'm Yeo Yang, the research lead at Dodo. Dodo is a Dex based PMM algorithm, and we are trying to provide the best chain liquidity with market make strategy. Excited to be here and discuss with all you guys about the new DeFi trends.
07:29:58.990 - 07:30:02.354, Speaker A: Yeah. Hi. I'm Ken.
07:30:02.354 - 07:30:26.202, Speaker A: I lead the institutional business at Pendle. We provide a market for fixed rates and yield trading in DeFi, and we support different types of underlying assets, including East LSDs per decks protocols, as well as real world assets. I'm Rick, I'm a core contributor at Gaines Network, which is an onchain's perpetual futures exchange.
07:30:26.202 - 07:30:45.366, Speaker A: We allow you to trade crypto, forex, and commodities crypto up to 150 X leverage and forex, and commodities forex up to 1500 X leverage. And yeah, we have the most capital efficient system, I would say. Hi.
07:30:45.366 - 07:30:50.310, Speaker A: My name is Morad. I work at GSR. I've been there since 2014.
07:30:50.310 - 07:31:05.946, Speaker A: GSR is a crypto market maker and liquidity provider, initially on centralized exchanges, but more and more on decentralized exchanges, and that's where my focus is. Hi, I'm Jesper. I'm very excited to be here.
07:31:05.946 - 07:31:23.518, Speaker A: I'm co founder of Panoptic. We're creating perpetual options that are oracle free as well and can run on Ethereum main net. So we've invented a new way to bring basically options to decentralized ecosystems that are entirely permissionless as well.
07:31:23.518 - 07:31:27.234, Speaker A: Very excited to be here. Thank you. Yeah, great.
07:31:27.234 - 07:32:15.380, Speaker A: It looks like everyone is in this space for a long time, and we know in 2020 we have DFI summer, and after DFI Summer, we see an explosive growth of DFI protocols. Just wanted to know, how do you foresee the future of DeFi? Do you think there is going to be another DeFi summer later in this one or two years? What's your opinion on that? Yeah, as you can see, since DeFi summer, many DeFi developers are actively exploring and building more services for the ecosystem. So now Defy world has gotten way bigger in terms of TVL number of users and other protocols out there.
07:32:15.380 - 07:32:46.170, Speaker A: In my view. In the short term, with more and more essays remain unused in the industry and people are finding ways to earn a steady income. So DeFi has gradually shifted in two directions like inward development like LS DeFi and outward development like RWA.
07:32:46.170 - 07:33:26.600, Speaker A: If there will be a DeFi, will I believe we'll get there? And if we talk about the future of DeFi, maybe I hope one day DeFi can achieve the thing described by the intent narratives. Basically like users no longer need to switch chains, frequently jump different platforms, or send multiple approvals in a row. We know how frustrating it can be.
07:33:26.600 - 07:33:46.138, Speaker A: So I think we've come a long way from DFI summer a lot of unsustainable sources of yields in 2020. Today, obviously a lot of that has changed. We have real infrastructure that we can use with money markets, with Perbxis, which also leads to real sources of yields.
07:33:46.138 - 07:34:23.574, Speaker A: Post Ethereum Chappelle upgrade, you get ETH Staking yield that's becoming more and more ubiquitous and then you get GMX and Gains Network providing LPs with real sources of yields. So I think where we are today is that we're seeing more and more financialization of those yields and that's one of the use cases that we do at Pendle. In terms of the future of DeFi, I think we'll probably see more integration of DeFi into mainstream centralized platforms, especially post Luna, post FTX.
07:34:23.574 - 07:34:49.262, Speaker A: I think there's more and more need for noncustodial services that basically serve as the plumbing into most of crypto. Yeah, so I think since the DFI summary in 2020 we've definitely came a long way. I would say it was a time when money was cheap and with a new asset class and it's exciting, you can kind of go into this rampant speculation mode.
07:34:49.262 - 07:35:16.060, Speaker A: But yeah, as Ken mentioned, a lot of it is based on hype and no real yield. So for example, at Gains we basically found real product market fit where people are actually willing to pay a price for the product that they're using without incentivization of tokens. And I think this is a very powerful thing because we finally see the real strength of DeFi here.
07:35:16.060 - 07:35:39.730, Speaker A: There are innovations that you can build on blockchain tech that haven't been possible before. Like for example, we recently pushed the Lookbex update which allows you to have guaranteed order execution on chain and this would only be possible in a deterministic settlement layer like a blockchain. So that is like an innovation that you will not see in web two.
07:35:39.730 - 07:35:47.846, Speaker A: Not even finance can do that. Only we can as of now. But we'll likely see copycat soon, maybe we don't know.
07:35:47.846 - 07:36:18.480, Speaker A: And for the future growth of DeFi, I think there's like a fast way and a slow way. The fast way is probably like, okay, we're in a higher interest rate environment. Something breaks down, people feel unsatisfied and they just all go through DeFi because it's the only option and the slow pace is, okay, we just keep on iterating until the efficiency of the system that we're building outpaces whatever efficiency the legacy system is lacking and then people will just slowly move over.
07:36:18.480 - 07:36:43.480, Speaker A: I do think that DeFi is the cat is out the bag and it's here to stay. I don't think it's going away anywhere in terms of like actual TVL. I think, you know, during 20, 21, 22, it may have been a bit too inflated with the tokens and the food coins having extreme values and stuff like that.
07:36:43.480 - 07:37:12.820, Speaker A: But I think the building blocks, most of them came early on in DFI, some newer ones came a little bit later. Specifically I'm thinking of like protocol owned liquidity and stuff like this, which is something new that you probably aren't seeing in TradFi. And I think it especially serves a purpose for long tail assets and stuff like this.
07:37:12.820 - 07:37:39.666, Speaker A: You probably won't have as developed markets for them. So I think it's got its place. Yeah, a lot of stuff has already been said, but I personally take a very long term view on the ecosystem and the, you know, when you kind of zoom out, I just think it's super apparent, at least that's my perspective, that kind of paraphrasing murad.
07:37:39.666 - 07:37:44.714, Speaker A: But the genie is out of the bottle. I mean, we're not going to go back on this. The technology is there.
07:37:44.714 - 07:37:59.150, Speaker A: I think we're just experiencing kind of a natural evolution of just exploring what's possible. And unfortunately that has led to some scammy things. It kind of always has in history when a new technology has come around.
07:37:59.150 - 07:38:22.758, Speaker A: But I do think what we're seeing is an underlying trend that is up to the right, which is things are actually being built on the back end. It's just not going as fast as the hype cycles because at the end of the day, we can't build as fast as our imagination can take us. So the hype cycle kind of follows the imagination and gets a little bit depressed when it doesn't quite come to fruition yet.
07:38:22.758 - 07:38:33.466, Speaker A: But we're going in that direction and the future will run entirely on blockchain in like 99% of the cases. That's my perspective. I have no doubt about that.
07:38:33.466 - 07:38:50.510, Speaker A: We do need to do a lot of evolution with the technology, but we'll get there over time and anything health, tech, supply chains, finance, of course everything will run on blockchain. I have just no doubt about it. So I'm very bullish long term on everything.
07:38:50.510 - 07:39:06.610, Speaker A: But there is some noise and there's some cycles we got to go through. But I think we'll have a few more cycles too with like CK technology and know things like RWA, who knows? But there are going to be other hype cycles. Yeah, I think you have a strong belief in DeFi.
07:39:06.610 - 07:39:35.950, Speaker A: So definitely the answer to the question of do you think DeFi will eventually replace the bank system? So your answer is jasper's answer is definitely yes, I guess. What about the others? I think there's mean the further out you look the more and more likely it is. But I think in the short term there's definitely challenges.
07:39:35.950 - 07:40:13.420, Speaker A: The one that comes to mind is most on chain DeFi. Financial products that are out there are usually over collateralized rather than under collateralized which is the very common thing in TradFi. So there's ways to get there maybe proof of personhood and KYC and stuff like this or credit risk and credit scores but I think it's moving in that yeah I have my own yeah I definitely agree on the credit stuff.
07:40:13.420 - 07:40:31.534, Speaker A: I know that we hate under collateralized lending in DeFi but no ecosystem can grow without undercollateralized lending. You just need good credit markets. So I think that will be, once we figure that out, I think that will be a major push for growth as well.
07:40:31.534 - 07:40:53.974, Speaker A: And yeah we don't have all the infrastructure yet but I think I know the smartest people that I know are basically working on building out the infrastructure that we need to have. For example, governments be comfortable running their rails on a blockchain back end and I mean the internet has been around for like 35 years. Okay.
07:40:53.974 - 07:41:20.174, Speaker A: As we know it a little bit longer maybe or whatever like 35, 40 years and we're just at the start basically. It's going to integrate into our lives so much more and it just seems insane to me that in 20 or 30 years we'll still be running the world's financial system on legacy banking tech like no that's not going to happen, it needs to be something else and I think it's going to be for sure. For sure.
07:41:20.174 - 07:41:48.618, Speaker A: Yes. Got it. Then I have another question regarding one of the challenges in DeFi is the mass adoption, right? So I wanted to know maybe from Ken from your perspective, how do you onboard more institution users or like retail users to use your protocol? I think for retail it's quite straightforward in the sense that a lot of the DeFi mechanics is quite cumbersome still.
07:41:48.618 - 07:42:30.614, Speaker A: So getting into DeFi, getting assets onboarded, figuring out what the basic OpSec looks like, I think that's all still quite an obstacle and it needs to be abstracted away with regards to institutional clients, there's an element of operational hurdles as well, but I think more importantly the availability of risk reporting tools. So how do you manage risk? How do you measure? And I think a lot of the risk in DeFi is still quite hard to measure, especially when it comes to smart contract risk. When it comes to risks that are basically binary in nature, you kind of sign a haircut to that.
07:42:30.614 - 07:42:54.906, Speaker A: So that's going to be quite challenging for the time being. Although I think in this bare period there's a lot of infrastructure projects have been built to solve all these problems. But for now what we are doubling down on is at least on the education side, not only on our product and how our markets work, but also just best practices that we've seen from other institutional clients.
07:42:54.906 - 07:43:16.850, Speaker A: Yeah, I like pendle. You have different version, right? You have the concise version for retailers and you have a little bit more complicated version for institutions. Yes, we do have two front ends pendle earn that is more geared towards retail users, a simple way to long fixed rates and we have trade where the market is a bit more sophisticated and you have the ability to go both sides.
07:43:16.850 - 07:43:41.040, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. How about Jasper, what's your idea in terms of the mass adoption? I think a few things have to happen. So one is really we've got to overcome this regulatory kind of monster, if you will, which is just really hindering a lot of growth in the space and obviously there's some shadiness going on there.
07:43:41.040 - 07:43:55.714, Speaker A: But once that clarity comes around then I think we'll see a lot more kind of inflow of capital and interest in the space. That's one thing. The other thing is also security.
07:43:55.714 - 07:44:17.414, Speaker A: We really got to step up in general the security of these smart contracts because the hacks are it's just too much right now. We really do need to figure out a better way and that comes through just better tooling, better education of our engineers and so on. And then I think also just we got to make it more user friendly for retail as well.
07:44:17.414 - 07:44:47.902, Speaker A: It's still a little too advanced to use for many folks. So to really get that broad adoption, I think we got to make it at least as easy and simple as kind of like where Fintech so Fintech has made the UI experience of very simple. But where Fintech is not going to be able to keep innovating, and iterating is they have the fundamental limitation of the rails they're running on is this old, old financial system that still codes and cobalt.
07:44:47.902 - 07:44:55.554, Speaker A: And like, there's only two engineers at a bank that's allowed to touch the code, right? Because or else everything breaks. This is not the future obviously. Right.
07:44:55.554 - 07:45:21.200, Speaker A: So what Blockchain brings is kind of what Fintech wanted to do essentially, right? So maybe we even need to rebrand to Fintech because that's kind of what we are. But if you can kind of take the UI of Fintech and keep iterating on that and put it on the rails of Blockchain, I think that's going to be important too because that's what the users are used to. So when you start having this lock in and the hex address and all this stuff they're kind of like what am I doing? So think those are kind of some broad things that need to happen.
07:45:21.200 - 07:46:00.170, Speaker A: Yeah I think all of you touch base on from the regulatory perspective but do you think the DeFi protocol can be regulated by the government or by someone else? Maybe this question goes to Morette. Yeah, this is a difficult one. I think there's a lot that we can do and that many projects in the space are doing to be like self regulatory but I mean ultimately regulation means that it's an authority, it's usually a government and it does seem like some games or something are going on.
07:46:00.170 - 07:46:12.766, Speaker A: It's very difficult. I know that a lot of people that we deal with are on the sidelines. Until there's some clarity around that it's a difficult one.
07:46:12.766 - 07:46:43.670, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. How about Yao? Yao? Personally, I would say regulating a decentralized system is inherently challenging but it's not impossible. Regulators can focus on the on wraps and off wraps where the fair to mali enters and exits the DeFi ecosystems.
07:46:43.670 - 07:47:11.998, Speaker A: Additionally, developers and project leaders they can make sure that their platforms adhere to the local regulations but generally speaking it's a complex issue and I mean the approach will likely vary by descriptions. Sorry. Yeah.
07:47:11.998 - 07:47:52.682, Speaker A: Nick, how do you think I think it can be regulated it's just that in my view a lot of people that work at government are pretty a little bit mid and I think if you have like the government has no way to attest whether or not civilization can rely upon ZK proof. So for example with DeFi problem is no counterparty risk is great unless the counterparty is a sanctioned entity. So how do we know that the counterparty is not a sanctioned entity? Well, we can use ZK proofs but nobody at government will, at least that I know of is actively pushing for this type of technology because they know it works.
07:47:52.682 - 07:48:25.526, Speaker A: So it's kind of like a chicken and egg problem where government doesn't know if we can rely on it and we can prove that we can rely on it without the regulation. So I think the way forward is like maybe some type of special economic zone where d five people can just mess around and figure it out but I do think that is what it requires. Like it needs some type of break in in a positive way else it's going to take a very long time but we'll be here.
07:48:25.526 - 07:48:49.674, Speaker A: Yeah sometimes black swan events actually push the industry forward to some extent. Yeah I'd also love to know more about the real world assets and how DeFi is utilized under the scenario of real world assets RWA anyone has an opinion regarding that? Maybe? Nick? I do have an opinion. I think real world assets are going to play a very important role.
07:48:49.674 - 07:49:13.446, Speaker A: However, the domain model of a blockchain that we're working with is pretty. So, like, how do you express a complicated legal contract on chain? Right now? It's pretty much impossible. So you would need to have some natural semantic language and data at a station that you can prove that this contract is legally binding and there's some type of way of enforcing this.
07:49:13.446 - 07:49:41.534, Speaker A: And I think there are definitely technologies being built that allows us to have more of these capabilities like account abstraction where you can build like permissioned wallet, like some permissioned wallet where you can enforce more complicated contracts than we can now. But yeah, the real world needs to go on chain 100% that will happen but we just need better infrastructure for it I would say. Yeah, that makes sense.
07:49:41.534 - 07:50:25.440, Speaker A: I think a lot of banks actually wanted to enter this sector because they have already have the evaluation of the collaterals as well. So I talked to one of the banks from Hrdit and then they wanted to see more about the best practices of RWA and how know how things could work maybe. How about Ken, can you give us some examples? I think RWAs has a very strong PMF in the sense that there are a lot of assets on chain managed by let's say large entities like DAOs or even some centralized entities that would like the ability to go risk on and risk off easily, especially now with rates coming up.
07:50:25.440 - 07:51:00.970, Speaker A: It's a very strong use case and I think what is interesting about the prospects of RWE and DeFi is the fact that there will be more different types of primitives built on top of that as a base layer. So once you have for example, T bill's rates available on chain in size you can enable a lot of other things. For example on Pendle, obviously we have the ability to speculate on the direction of RWAs on chain and I think there'll be so much more use case in terms of using them as collateral, using them as different services in DeFi.
07:51:00.970 - 07:51:24.980, Speaker A: Jasper? Yeah. Do you have any practices on your protocol regarding RWA perpetual? Yeah so for example, Panoptic is purely on chain, it's permissionless, it's oracle free as well. So the point is that we're very bullish on a future where everything lives on chain and in kind of a self contained ecosystem as well.
07:51:24.980 - 07:51:47.622, Speaker A: And yeah, having that bridge to the real world, I think is important. But once it lives on chain I'm also very excited about this kind of opening up to all these new things you can do now, like building. New primitives on top of that, building derivatives on top of that, having options on top of that, all kinds of stuff you can do.
07:51:47.622 - 07:52:09.150, Speaker A: And you can even do things that TradFi of course can't do. And I'm actually very excited to see those kind of solutions come up as well in the future. So I think we can really also expand the economy quite a lot more in general because things can get a lot more kind of fluid and can integrate much better and much more easily.
07:52:09.150 - 07:52:56.640, Speaker A: And also become, ideally, in my own hope, less siloed. So, for example, the openness of Web Three I think is going to help us really work towards growing everything, the economy better. So, for example, if you look at TradFi, you have all these financial engineers sitting in one institution in a siloed, closed source environment, and then they go to another financial institution and they just implement the same thing and then the same thing, and it all's just a waste of time and energy because how about we just implement it once or whatever, like a few times? And then we have that as a base layer, and then we kind of keep building on top, like money legos on top of all this, so that we keep moving things forward and come up with new, innovative, interesting solutions for everybody, and hopefully can provide more financial means and better.
07:52:56.640 - 07:53:14.420, Speaker A: Primitives to more people in general, not just the elites and everything, but we can really bring more people into a better financial environment in general. So I'm very bullish on bringing the existing world on chain. And then once on chain, I think it's a whole new universe that you open up.
07:53:14.420 - 07:53:22.278, Speaker A: Yeah, you're bullish in every sector, basically. That's great. That's great.
07:53:22.278 - 07:53:40.250, Speaker A: Very optimistic. And also I wanted to know, what do you think are the challenges for RWA? Do you think it's lack of standards or there's something or irregulatory perspective? What do you think are the challenges here? It's at a very early stage, by the way. Maybe murad.
07:53:40.250 - 07:53:58.706, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll say definitely it needs to be more expressive. As you were talking about, I don't think we're going to expect lawyers to write solidity code very well. So there probably needs to be some layer above that.
07:53:58.706 - 07:54:33.594, Speaker A: And basically that's translating into security problems. If you want something to be quasilegal or enforceable in a legal way, then it sort of breaks the bearer asset thing. I do think there's a lot of synergy between NFTs and DeFi, even though they're sometimes seen as separate, but stuff like soul bound tokens and stuff like this, or whitelists on who can interact with a certain asset on chain.
07:54:33.594 - 07:54:47.330, Speaker A: So I think security is the big one. Got it. Nick, how about you? I think it challenges the interoperability with legacy systems in a sense.
07:54:47.330 - 07:55:22.800, Speaker A: So right now, there's not that many ways for a legacy system to talk to a blockchain system. And I know the guys at Chainlink are doing their best to bring this all on chain, but that would be like an infrastructure need that is very much needed for real world assets to become a real thing. Okay, we have the custodian of the bank who's holding all these bonds, and then there we know the bank has the bonds, and then they can interact with the blockchain system and basically open this up to this global financial ecosystem that we're building.
07:55:22.800 - 07:56:01.466, Speaker A: I also think for now because we are still kind of like a small ecosystem us as a consumer as the DeFi is not big enough for people to actively push from the legacy side things on chain. So it really needs to be a clear efficiency gain on their end for them to do that or we just need to bring so many people in with like a hook of some sorts that the consumer side grows and then they will want to be on chain because that's where the consumer is. That makes sense.
07:56:01.466 - 07:56:28.018, Speaker A: There is kind of like an investment cycle where it's kind of like you have the application and then infrastructure grows and then it's application and then pushes to the infrastructure so it's kind of like that right? So right now we still need more applications on chain and doing DeFi. And then maybe when the user space become larger and larger and then we will push back the regulatory perspective as well as the infrastructure as well. Yeah.
07:56:28.018 - 07:57:03.834, Speaker A: So how about, Ken, how do you think about the future of RWA as well as its integration with the TFI? I think RWAs the current biggest challenge is probably on Composability because a lot of products like T bills on chain are very permissioned. They're very behind KYC walls, for example. But I think the industry has been innovating on that front to come up with, say, money markets that leverage on T bill tokens as collateral and then using those tokens that you borrow to be more fungible across DeFi.
07:57:03.834 - 07:57:55.306, Speaker A: So I think seeing some trends there and I think as we see more developments not just in RWS but even other spaces like E Three Staking and whatnot I think those concepts potentially could apply us also to TBOS how about Yao? Yao yeah. RWA is a promising frontier and right now many old DeFi protocols they have started to target RWA track. I know that Maker JOWS their RWA accolation exceeds to $2 billion and generating like $1 million in revenue.
07:57:55.306 - 07:58:13.266, Speaker A: I don't remember the specific number, but pretty much like this. The true potential of RWA use cases is yet to be fully unlocked. Right mean, but they are print on the market.
07:58:13.266 - 07:58:42.286, Speaker A: So I guess maybe other DeFi protocols maybe they can figure out how do they improve their protocols with RWA expect like you told the and I think that's important. Yeah great. One final question.
07:58:42.286 - 07:59:26.474, Speaker A: I think this goes to you all. We're talking about a lot of challenges in DeFi, but I also wanted to know, do you guys see any opportunities and in which direction do you think it will grow massive? Like maybe in the next one or two years and maybe talking about your project a little bit? Like which direction you wanted to go? I want to hear some secrets all right, let's go with Jasper first and then yeah, that's an easy one for me I'm very bullish bullish on Mean I personally think so talking about the project a little bit. At Panoptic we really want to see the options side of DeFi grow quite a lot more than it has.
07:59:26.474 - 08:00:03.618, Speaker A: It's still pretty quite suppressed. So we want decentralized permissionless, fully on chain options to really become a thing because any financial ecosystem that's healthy has the four pillars, including futures, but then importantly also options and so on. That's what I would love to see, really kind of just also get more just comfortability about stable yields, I think is very important because the capital, I think, is just a little bit scared and uneasy because they're entering.
08:00:03.618 - 08:00:30.478, Speaker A: Into this system where everything is much more turbulent, but having some sort of stability, which then RWAs can help with. And other protocols, of course. Also on this panel we'll hear about, but just like creating just a healthy ecosystem as a baseline so we get that capital on chain and into the industry and then they can always kind of go from there and do more risky things as they like.
08:00:30.478 - 08:00:54.360, Speaker A: But the fact that they're not even want to go on chain yet, right, because it's like all just unfortunately a lot of hacks and not predictable yields and stuff I think is hindering the space. What we hope to do at Panoptic is really to bring options on chain and grow that and make that work in a fully decentralized permissionless manner. So yeah, that's what I'm hoping to see.
08:00:54.360 - 08:01:30.254, Speaker A: Yeah, on my side as a trading firm and a regulated trading firm at that, we would like to see more institutions get comfortable and whatever they need around that. So any innovation in that direction is sort of where we're keeping our eyes focused. Well, for Gains, I think where it's going to go is that like a couple of years ago everybody was trading at centralized exchanges.
08:01:30.254 - 08:01:51.630, Speaker A: Right now it's more like 40 60 on chain, on chain volume, spot volume versus 60% centralized spot volume. And a lot of that is also like HFT arbitrage opportunities. But if you look at the perp space of the perpetual futures volume, only 1.2%
08:01:51.630 - 08:02:18.402, Speaker A: is happening on chain and we think, or at least I believe that we're going to follow trend with Spot and it's such a massive, massive, massive opportunity. And I really think at Gains we're basically just at the start of where we're going to be. I mean, we already showed with our recent updates that we can do things that nobody else can because we are on chain and that is where the power of blockchain really shines.
08:02:18.402 - 08:02:44.158, Speaker A: Like doing these things that only are capable, that you're only capable of doing them on chain. So I think gains is basically our architecture is the best when it comes to capital efficiency. So with the lowest TVL you could trade the largest position sizes and that is the powerful part of our protocol basically.
08:02:44.158 - 08:02:58.290, Speaker A: And at some point in time I believe that we're going to be everywhere basically and. I know that our team is the one who's going to clear it. We are the team that's going to do it.
08:02:58.290 - 08:03:31.338, Speaker A: I think we iterate faster than anybody else and yeah, we're going to see massive growth on the onchain perps and we are going to be number one. Yeah. For Dodo we are still focused on the liquidity efficiency and that's what Dodo V Three is building to and we are focused on market making strategies, especially for those more market makers.
08:03:31.338 - 08:04:23.120, Speaker A: We are trying to provide these flexible tools for those marked makers to help them to earn the best benefits on our Dodo. For other aspects, I would like to say I really like the RWA, just like I told, I think it has a huge potential and will release some huge potential in the future. No one can say when Defy reach the next trillion dollar milestone, but I believe those of us we have reason to believe that we will get there sooner or later.
08:04:23.120 - 08:04:46.294, Speaker A: Just echoing what Rick just mentioned, I think we're starting to see more and more things that used to be only able to be done on CFI like exchanges and lenders like BlockFi for example. A lot of that can now be done directly on DeFi. You see like GMX and gainstrade very seamless experience, very similar experience.
08:04:46.294 - 08:05:00.118, Speaker A: And I think I would like to see more centralized platforms utilize DeFi as the back end. So a simple example would be for Pendle. We have Pendleearn which is a modular way to plug in our service into exchanges.
08:05:00.118 - 08:05:16.198, Speaker A: Most recently we've seen adoption from exchanges like Okx who's adopted Pendleearn as a way to get fixed rates on their platform. So we'd like to see more of that. Hi, totally agreed.
08:05:16.198 - 08:05:40.910, Speaker A: And I also think the smooth seamless user experience of trade on different platforms is important for DeFi protocols as well. Great, I think we have a great panel. Do you have any last questions or last words to the future of DeFi? Maybe just say one person, shout out one sentence to the future of DeFi and then we're going to end today's session.
08:05:40.910 - 08:06:04.730, Speaker A: Okay, Jasper, don't say you're bullish on everything. Okay? Yeah, let's go with the very simple long DeFi. Okay? Yeah, I think it's going to be quite invisible I think in terms of the developments of DeFi, it'll be basically the plumbing of CFI.
08:06:04.730 - 08:06:13.750, Speaker A: Trygains trade. Nice. Let's bring everything on chain.
08:06:13.750 - 08:06:20.634, Speaker A: I am not bearish. Great. Thank you all.
08:06:20.634 - 08:06:48.458, Speaker A: Thank you all. I hope you enjoyed the panel and thanks everyone for attending this panel. Thank you all, thank you and Harris Or for today's talks and panels and hopefully everyone can find some new trends in our new chance to meet.
