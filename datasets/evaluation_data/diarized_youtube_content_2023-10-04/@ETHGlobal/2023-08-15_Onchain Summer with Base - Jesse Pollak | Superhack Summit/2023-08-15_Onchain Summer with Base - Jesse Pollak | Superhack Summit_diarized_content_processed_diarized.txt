00:00:07.210 - 00:00:13.600, Speaker A: Without further ado, let's welcome Jesse to talk about Base and on Chain Summer. Hi.
00:00:14.290 - 00:00:17.194, Speaker B: Glad to be here. Thanks for having me. It's Friday.
00:00:17.194 - 00:00:20.880, Speaker B: I'm wearing my Friday shirt and it's on chain summer. Let's go.
00:00:22.530 - 00:00:45.562, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, when I end this off you well, first I want to say congratulations on what an incredible week this has been. I've always seen incredible, amazing excitement on everywhere else, on social media and I'm sure the rest of your team and you are feeling incredibly grateful for how this all has been kind of that family come together.
00:00:45.562 - 00:00:47.818, Speaker A: So big congrats to all of you.
00:00:47.984 - 00:00:51.894, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, we're excited about it. It's been a massive team effort.
00:00:51.894 - 00:01:00.586, Speaker B: It's not just base. I feel like the whole world's starting to come on chain this summer. And so I feel like we're just joining the party.
00:01:00.586 - 00:01:10.450, Speaker B: So it's been so inspiring to see how many folks have been hacking over the last week. I think we had, what, like 1000 plus hackers here?
00:01:10.520 - 00:01:13.746, Speaker A: More than 1150.
00:01:13.928 - 00:01:18.038, Speaker B: 1150. I mean, that's crazy. That's crazy.
00:01:18.038 - 00:01:32.362, Speaker B: I think that there's a couple hundred of those who are building cool things on base. So super team super dream super chain on chain summer all the energy. I'm ready.
00:01:32.496 - 00:01:34.038, Speaker A: Hundreds of projects.
00:01:34.214 - 00:01:37.754, Speaker B: Hundreds of projects. Yeah, it's epic. I can't wait to see them all.
00:01:37.754 - 00:02:04.370, Speaker B: Also, just as like a fun fact, we inspired by Super Hack, are doing a on Chain Summer hackathon next Thursday and Friday at Coinbase. And so that means that you're going to have another few hundred hackers joining the efforts. We're not going to be going through the super act stuff, but it's pretty cool that we're going to have another couple of hundred folks building on Chain this summer.
00:02:04.370 - 00:02:14.150, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Yeah, it's happening. So I think what, I have like 20 minutes right now to get going.
00:02:14.220 - 00:02:19.258, Speaker A: And we can hand it a few more minutes. So I know you have last of slides if you're ready.
00:02:19.424 - 00:02:30.454, Speaker B: I got some slides pulled together. We're doing it. It's been a hectic week, so everyone bear with me as I do this, but I'm looking at the last stream.
00:02:30.454 - 00:02:49.342, Speaker B: I see people in the Chat. Maybe just to start, if you're in the Chat, in the Superacc Summit chat, maybe you can just drop where are you calling in from? Maybe like drop a flag or drop a country. I guess it's in there, but just like give me subs, but hey, everyone, I'm Jesse.
00:02:49.342 - 00:02:53.010, Speaker B: We got New York City summer. Let's go. Unchained summer.
00:02:53.010 - 00:02:59.302, Speaker B: Let me put up these slides. We got San Francisco, we got the Canary Highlands, india. Let's go.
00:02:59.302 - 00:03:06.760, Speaker B: We are an international crew. Pretty epic. Okay, let me put these slides up.
00:03:06.760 - 00:03:11.290, Speaker B: I hope folks arizona. We got the United States. We got Ireland.
00:03:11.290 - 00:03:20.986, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, I'm Jesse. I'm the Creator of Base. Been in the kind of Coinbase orbit for the last seven years.
00:03:20.986 - 00:03:35.890, Speaker B: Been working to bring Coinbase on Chain and building Base for the last two years. And I'm here to talk to you about base on chain summer, what's going on, and get into it. And before I talk about all those things, I just want to talk about this word on chain.
00:03:35.890 - 00:03:49.910, Speaker B: I think folks have probably heard it enough at this point in the title. But just as a quick refresher, the way we think about on chain, there's kind of three eras of the world right now. There was the before internet days.
00:03:49.910 - 00:04:14.918, Speaker B: That was what we call offline. That was when really, we were just if you wanted to learn something, you listened to the news, you watch the TV, everything was unidirectional. And if you wanted to create something, there were all these gatekeepers, the publishers, the producers, the folks who basically got to decide, could you have a voice? And then in the early 2000s, we all went online.
00:04:14.918 - 00:04:26.334, Speaker B: And that's when I grew up. It was a pretty magical time, because I think for the first time, all of our creativity could come out and we could share it with the world. We could write, and it became bi directional.
00:04:26.334 - 00:04:36.260, Speaker B: And that's what created Twitter. It's what created instagram. It's what created TikTok, what created this incredible wave of creativity that I think transformed the world for the better of the last 20 years.
00:04:36.260 - 00:04:59.334, Speaker B: But if you reflect on kind of what wasn't perfect during that time and what left a lot to be desired is even as we were all kind of having this creativity, even as we were bringing this creativity to the world, when we were putting it online, it stopped becoming ours. It stopped being ours. I put my content on Facebook, and now Facebook set the rules.
00:04:59.334 - 00:05:19.780, Speaker B: I put my content on TikTok, and TikTok set the rules. I made incredibly creative things, and they got to decide how much I earned based on it, and they got to take most of the money. And instead what I got was likes and comments which can't be exchanged for food or any of the things that let me live a better life, grow a happier family, build a better business.
00:05:19.780 - 00:05:40.854, Speaker B: And so we believe that we are on the precipice right now, the next generation of the Internet, which is the on chain era. And we believe that the big shift that's happening is that for the first time, not only can we read it and write, but we can also own. And for the first time, when we have creativity, when we make things and we put them into the world, those things remain ours.
00:05:40.854 - 00:05:57.802, Speaker B: The song remains ours. And we can earn from every time someone the piece of writing remains ours, and we can earn to every time someone engages with it. And we could enter this next era where I think we're going to see much more economic freedom.
00:05:57.802 - 00:06:13.300, Speaker B: We're going to see folks having much more resources, and we're going to see folks having much more sovereignty and feeling much more autonomy to actually be able to live their life. And so that's on chain. And I think the thing that's exciting to me about Chain is that it feels like it's finally here.
00:06:13.300 - 00:06:39.930, Speaker B: Just in the last three to six months it feels like we've really started to have new use cases being built on chain. On chain music with things like Sound, on chain media with things like Zora Manifold highlight, just incredible folks who are enabling rules for creators on chain games. Today I was on a live stream with Parallel Team who's building an incredible trading card game we have on chain communities.
00:06:39.930 - 00:07:12.120, Speaker B: I've been working in City of Oakland to build Oak which is a community currency there. On chain advocacy, even Coinbase has been leading the way with Stand with Crypto which is a fully on chain advocacy campaign where you can mint an NFT to support, get involved and activate to bring better crypto policy to the world. And so we at Base are basically trying to figure out what can we do to make it so On Chain gets accessible to everyone and that everyone can start to build.
00:07:12.120 - 00:07:23.900, Speaker B: We opened up Base mainnet for everyone this Wednesday. So that was a huge milestone after six months of hard work. And many of the folks who are listening into this are building on Base.
00:07:23.900 - 00:07:39.646, Speaker B: I think there's like a couple hundred teams that are building on base in some way during super app and there's been so much energy over the last three to four days as we open up Base for everyone just to give a little bit more color. On Base is an ethereum layer. Two.
00:07:39.646 - 00:07:45.578, Speaker B: It's built on the op stack. It's part of the superchain. That's why you're here for super hack.
00:07:45.578 - 00:08:05.330, Speaker B: And we really think that Base is going to enable the next generation of on chain products and that people are going to have an easier time building apps. People are going to have an easier time using those apps through interfaces like Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet and all the other incredible wallets. We're working with, like, rainbow and rabi and frame and MetaMask and Trustwallet.
00:08:05.330 - 00:08:25.758, Speaker B: And that this combination of easier application building and easier application using is going to enable the next wave of crypto adoption that brings billions of builders and billions of users on. One of the things that's really important to us is decentralization. And so we've been talking about kind of three commitments to decentralization that we've made for Base.
00:08:25.758 - 00:08:37.486, Speaker B: The first is technical investments in decentralization. We've joined as the second core developer of the Op Stack alongside Op Labs. We've already made a bunch of kind of key contributions on Scalability.
00:08:37.486 - 00:08:57.586, Speaker B: We're working right now on something called Apt Ref which is the second client for the Op Stack and also working on Security Council a few other technical initiatives to help Base decentralized faster and every Op Stack change. Decentralized faster. We also are participating in an open neutrality framework called the Law of Chains.
00:08:57.586 - 00:09:25.582, Speaker B: This is something that we helped co create with optimism over the last nine months and it's the thing that allows us to keep Base open and decentralized and permissionless, what allows us to ensure that Base looks and feels and acts like ethereum. And then finally, our third commitment to decentralization is that we are funding public goods. We're taking a portion of all of the transaction revenue that's generated on Base and we are routing it to the optimism collective to fund public goods.
00:09:25.582 - 00:09:47.842, Speaker B: This is really our commitment to ensuring that the underlying infrastructure that enables Basin is going to enable the next billion users to come on Chain as a sustainable funding source that can grow over time. And so that's what Basin is doing. But I think the thing to kind of ground us all in is that we're still very early in this journey.
00:09:47.842 - 00:10:02.334, Speaker B: There are less than 10 million people on Chain. There are 8 billion people in the world and so we have to get from 10 million to 8 billion people in the world. I'm seeing someone ask just in the chat can you index Base with the graph right now? The answer is yes.
00:10:02.334 - 00:10:15.966, Speaker B: The graph fully supports Base as does pretty much every other infrastructure provider. And so if you need a tool, I would just say ask. You can pop in the Base discord, you can drop in the chat right now.
00:10:15.966 - 00:10:36.370, Speaker B: I'll tell you yes or no. But we've worked really hard over the last six months to ensure that everything or as much as possible supported out of the box. And that's because we believe that it's not just going to be based, it's not just going to be Coin based, it's going to be all of us that get us from that 10 million people on Chain to the 8 billion people on Chain over the next decade.
00:10:36.370 - 00:10:50.060, Speaker B: And so the way we're really trying to kick that off is with on Chain summer. You've maybe seen this on Heat Internet over the last week. This is really bigger than Base.
00:10:50.060 - 00:11:18.610, Speaker B: We think about Base as joining the party, but that the party started at the beginning of the summer when the world started coming on chain. And our contribution is basically bringing a bunch more people to build a bunch. More cool stuff and share it with the world and then hopefully bring a bunch of users into the ecosystem so that they can experience what's happening on chain and get excited and get a crypto wallet and get involved.
00:11:18.610 - 00:11:36.970, Speaker B: Today, just as a shout, we did a really cool mint from Parallel. They are building a trading card game. You can get a starter pack for Parallel at onchainsumber XYZ, Parallel or justumber XYZ.
00:11:36.970 - 00:11:47.198, Speaker B: This gets you early access to the beta. It gets you all the cards you need to get started. The game is really cool, really excited, about it.
00:11:47.198 - 00:11:56.558, Speaker B: Folks have been loving playing it and it's all fully on chain. We also have a bunch more coming up. So tomorrow we're doing on chain music with another block.
00:11:56.558 - 00:12:15.270, Speaker B: We had to get one Web two brand in there. And so Coke is doing a really cool piece of on chain art with a bunch of artists, including kind of the Van Gogh and a bunch of emerging folks on Sunday. On Monday we have a day of action for Stand with Crypto where we're going to be telling the world why we need clearer policy.
00:12:15.270 - 00:12:30.310, Speaker B: On Tuesday we have Blackbird who's doing on chain restaurants with loyalty. They're doing the summer pass. And then every day, all the way through August, we have something else cool happening on chain.
00:12:30.310 - 00:12:44.366, Speaker B: And so if you want to get involved in on chain summer, you can go on chainsmart XYZ every day there'll be something new to do. We also have a trending tab and a community tab. And so if you build something on base this summer, let me know.
00:12:44.366 - 00:12:58.020, Speaker B: You can tweet at me, you can DM me and I'll make sure that we get it featured in the community section. And then if it goes viral, if people are minting and people are engaging, it'll show up automatically in the timing section. And we're seeing a ton of eyeballs right now.
00:12:58.020 - 00:13:19.802, Speaker B: I think yesterday we saw that there's like 100,000 plus people who visited. And so this is a great way to show off some of the cool stuff that all of you all are building every day and building in super hack. I think my message to all of you all is this chart down here that's the growth of L two S over the last year.
00:13:19.802 - 00:13:32.810, Speaker B: You can see that it kind of started at zero. Ethereum is the blue line and then it's kind of gradually grown up into the right. And we're at this inflection point where it's growing, but there's still more room for it to grow faster.
00:13:32.810 - 00:14:01.898, Speaker B: And so our belief is that this is it, that we're here, that the time is now, that the tools are finally ready, that it's on chain summer, and that it's going to take all of us to ignite what will be probably one of the most incredible growth journeys we've seen ever in the history of humanity. As the whole world moves, and so that's my message. If I had one other thing to say, it would be let's go build some cool stuff.
00:14:01.898 - 00:14:26.754, Speaker B: We have 1000 plus hackers here for each global. We know that there's already a bunch of projects being built on base and other chains that are going to be really impactful, that are going to help tell the story of on chain. And so if there's anything I can be doing, we can be doing to better support you all, if there's anything you need to make your on chain summer dreams come true, please let us know.
00:14:26.754 - 00:14:58.246, Speaker B: One last plug on that is we have 100 ETH of additional grants alongside the prizes we're doing for Superac that are open right now. You can learn more about those at Prop House base or you can just Google on chain summer grant and those will come up. Those are for all sorts of things creative projects, building on base account abstraction, infrastructure and so if you're building something cool this summer, please submit it for a grant.
00:14:58.246 - 00:15:13.680, Speaker B: We'd love to support you and the next generation of builders on base. And so with that, those are all the prepared remarks I have drop questions in the chat and I'm happy to answer them. We can take a few more minutes and then we can call it a day.
00:15:14.130 - 00:15:23.426, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. There's no way for people to ask questions to you directly over voice, but if they type anything in the chat we get to see all of them. We can relay that.
00:15:23.426 - 00:15:29.990, Speaker A: We do have a technical question coming in, which is is base already indexed by the graph right now?
00:15:30.140 - 00:15:43.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I answered it, I answered it live because I got the chat live stream. It's fully supported by the graph and pretty much every other infrastructure provider. And so if you need something, you can DM me about it, I'll make sure you get it.
00:15:44.350 - 00:15:45.210, Speaker A: Sweet.
00:15:45.790 - 00:16:03.790, Speaker B: The other hack ideas asked what hack ideas am I most excited about? I'm most excited about people building cool consumer product. It feels like the technology is finally there. We have account abstraction, we have low cost L two S, we have good wallet interfaces.
00:16:03.790 - 00:16:28.998, Speaker B: I don't know if folks have seen Friend Tech but that's been kind of like popping over the last 24 hours on base. And I think it's a great example where it's like you literally just put in your phone number, you can transfer an ETH, you can build whatever you want or you can do whatever you want there and you don't have to engage with crypto, you don't have to get a new wallet. So I think that that's awesome.
00:16:28.998 - 00:16:47.662, Speaker B: I want to see more experiments like that. I'd love to see people build consumer products on base. I also am really excited about anything that's on chain summer themed, telling the story of the world coming on chain this summer and every summer until everyone's here I think is really important and so would love to see projects relate to that.
00:16:47.662 - 00:17:04.980, Speaker B: I see someone just asked Linux or Windows if I had to pick between those two. I think Linux. I'm a hacker, I grew up on the command line and I used Bash for a while and user, so a little bit out there.
00:17:06.890 - 00:17:08.150, Speaker A: But I'm sensing.
00:17:14.810 - 00:17:40.682, Speaker B: What am I going to do? I'm a Mac user. I grew up like taking apart iPhones and watching Steve Jobs keynotes and yeah, grateful for all of the incredible products that Apple's built. Bryce just dropped in the Prop House round yeah, you can just go to prop house everything's retroactive and so build something cool, put it in there, and then folks are going to be kind of selecting what gets awarded the grants.
00:17:40.826 - 00:17:49.780, Speaker A: Amazing. Maybe one question, but what's been kind of a big learning from the last 48 hours?
00:17:50.950 - 00:18:08.886, Speaker B: What's been a big learning from the last 48 hours? I'd say the biggest learning is just like, man, there's so much energy out there, it just needs to be activated. We weren't really sure how people were going to respond when we started telling everyone, this is it. This is the summer the world comes on chain.
00:18:08.886 - 00:18:19.094, Speaker B: I think realistically, the world's not going to come on chain. We got a lot more work. Every summer is going to be on Chain Summer.
00:18:19.094 - 00:18:37.730, Speaker B: But I feel like there's something about just the vision that we're painting that is getting people fired up and is like juicing creativity and getting people to do things that maybe they didn't feel were possible before. And I don't know, that's been really refreshing. It's been energizing.
00:18:37.730 - 00:18:47.090, Speaker B: I feel solidly out of the bear market right now. We are solidly in the builder summer. On chain summer.
00:18:47.090 - 00:18:52.558, Speaker B: Grow it all, bring the world. Yeah.
00:18:52.744 - 00:18:58.630, Speaker A: And I bet a little bit of a relief too, now that we're there.
00:18:58.700 - 00:19:00.470, Speaker B: This is a little bit less pressure.
00:19:00.630 - 00:19:03.260, Speaker A: And you get to see things through.
00:19:03.790 - 00:19:08.442, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm really grateful that this is out in the world now and that we're past the launch. Man.
00:19:08.442 - 00:19:27.982, Speaker B: It's stressful launching something because it feels like you only really got to do it once. And so it's been a stressful three months of getting here and I think it's kind of nonstop through the end of August. Like every day I'm doing a live stream from now until the end of August.
00:19:27.982 - 00:19:33.602, Speaker B: Saturdays and Sundays included. Just telling the story of on Chain Summer. Every day we're doing a new mid.
00:19:33.602 - 00:19:43.638, Speaker B: Saturday and Sunday is included. So the next 20 days are going to be intense, but I feel like the pressure valve being released of like, oh, this thing is out in the world now. People are using it.
00:19:43.638 - 00:19:52.426, Speaker B: People are starting to build on it organically. That's been really great. I also see one more question in here.
00:19:52.426 - 00:20:05.440, Speaker B: What's our internal goal? KPI for a hundred summer 2023. Honestly, we've already exceeded all of our internal KPIs for Austin. Kind of crazily enough.
00:20:05.440 - 00:20:23.250, Speaker B: If you look at the activity on Bait, the goals that we originally set, we didn't know what to expect. We're like launching a new L Two, trying to compare it to other folks who have recently launched new L Two S. And I think we've already been kind of blown away by the response.
00:20:23.250 - 00:20:40.860, Speaker B: Just like today, I think yesterday we crossed 100,000 unique transacting addresses on base. Today I think we're going to track towards like 125,050 thousand members. Yeah, it's crazy.
00:20:40.860 - 00:20:59.914, Speaker B: That's way bigger than we were anticipating. And so I think we're kind of, like, doing a little bit of an internal reset right now. Okay, what do we go on for the rest of the month? And my attitude is it's day 1150,000 is big, relatively.
00:20:59.914 - 00:21:07.714, Speaker B: Right. I think base has the most transacting addresses of nel two today and yesterday. Maybe not yesterday, but will today.
00:21:07.714 - 00:21:19.030, Speaker B: But in the grand scheme of things, it's tiny, right? Like, we're talking about millions, billions of people that we need to bring on. And so I'm just now recalibrating. Let's go get to a million daily transacting addresses.
00:21:19.030 - 00:21:42.666, Speaker B: I think the biggest internal goal that I have is I just want to make our products like, all the products work better on base. That's been a forcing function for our on chain Summer is a forcing function for that. There's a part of it that was just, like, getting energy, getting momentum, getting movement, but the other part of it was, like, making it.
00:21:42.666 - 00:22:12.758, Speaker B: So every day, the Coinbase team, the Coinbase Wallet team, other wallet teams who are promoting on Chain Summer, doing activities on Chain Summer, they have to go through the experience of trying to use an onchain product and seeing what works, what doesn't work. And just in three days, every day, we've done a retro, an hour long retro with the Coinbase team, the Coinbase Wallet team, and the Base team for the last three days. And every day, we're like, here's a bunch of shit that's really broken that we need to fix.
00:22:12.758 - 00:22:28.730, Speaker B: And so I think that's probably the single biggest North Star for me this summer. It's like, can we make a 50% improvement, 100% improvement in quality of life, in quality of experience of people who are trying to transact every day on chain.
00:22:31.950 - 00:22:42.254, Speaker A: It's set up to be in that right world, too, because you now have this really tight feedback loop where you get to actually see and try things and just see the next iteration 24 hours and see if it worked or not.
00:22:42.292 - 00:22:51.058, Speaker B: And that's a great 100%. I was seeing someone asking about parallel, about prime on base. Prime, I think, is on base already.
00:22:51.058 - 00:23:06.726, Speaker B: It can be bridged via layer zero, like 80, 90% sure of that. If you want to tweet at me, I can tag the parallel team, and they can give you any information that you need that's in response to GOs Nico. Awesome to hear that the Dows migrated to Base this week.
00:23:06.726 - 00:23:24.214, Speaker B: We want more of that. We're here to make that happen and let us know if we can help. And then david deb Jadeed, you have a question on L two S navigating the regulatory space in general, our feeling is, like, there's a lot of need for regulatory clarity in the US.
00:23:24.214 - 00:24:04.362, Speaker B: And in countries around the world, and that's why we've been advocating for that Coinbase with Scan, with crypto, and with all the other stuff that we're doing. I think in general, our belief is that layer twos are an extension of ethereum, and that like ethereum, we should be standing for and fighting for layer twos to remain open, permissionless and decentralized. And so that's one of the big reasons why we are part of the superchain, why we're part of Superacc, why we're building on the Op stack, why we spent the last nine months working on this open neutrality framework called the Law of Chains because we believe that it requires decentralization, it requires open source, it requires real commitment to ensure that happens.
00:24:04.362 - 00:24:26.122, Speaker B: And so that's what I'm focused on when I'm not focused on on chain somewhere. I'm focused on ensuring that layer two remains open, permissionless and decentralized, because that's what's going to be required to have a global on chain economy and a global on chain platform that all of us can build on and that all of us can stand on with a level playing field. So I think I'm at time car kick.
00:24:26.122 - 00:24:34.898, Speaker B: Thanks for the questions. Everyone who is here, thanks for being here, thanks for hacking, thanks for being a part of super hack. Thanks for building this summer.
00:24:34.898 - 00:24:46.342, Speaker B: And if you launch stuff for on chain summer, tweet at me. We'll get it featured on the website. If you're looking for cool things to do on chain, go to onchainsummer XYZ every day.
00:24:46.342 - 00:24:51.000, Speaker B: There's one cool thing to do on Chain. Get on chain this summer. Let's go build some cool stuff.
00:24:51.770 - 00:24:54.930, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, Jesse. And we'll see you on chain.
00:24:55.090 - 00:24:56.822, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks, Cardi. See you later.
00:24:56.822 - 00:24:57.170, Speaker B: Bye.
