00:00:07.130 - 00:00:26.182, Speaker A: There's a lot of themes that we see constantly come up that we know are active problems, but not with a lot of good solutions. And to talk about that, I want to bring on Kemi to really go into the article and the talk she actually gave about a couple months ago. And we're going to dig into all the things that we think are not really working well in our ecosystem and how we can potentially fix them.
00:00:26.182 - 00:00:41.734, Speaker A: So without further ado, please welcome her on stage. I am super excited to have you here again. You've been part of almost every time we've been in this city and been a supporter of what we've done since the beginning.
00:00:41.862 - 00:00:46.678, Speaker B: Yes, it's been a pleasure. You guys are one of my favorites.
00:00:46.854 - 00:01:02.000, Speaker A: Well, thank you. And I love the defined because that's literally how I keep up with what's actually seen in this space. So a lot of what we're going to talk about will likely be controversial from the point of view of just pointing out the obvious.
00:01:02.000 - 00:01:27.654, Speaker A: So I want to set the stage on just making sure people know this is happening. And what I'll do is I'll kind of mostly have you cover a lot of the things that you talked about, but we'll sort of go into depth here. So a big piece of what we've seen in this industry over the last decade is, yes, we want decentralization, yes, we want things to work, but at the same time, we know that in some cases, things are not at the place where they want to be.
00:01:27.654 - 00:01:42.618, Speaker A: With respect to one to one feature parity on how the experience should be, to how certain guarantees should be made, on how you use a different protocol. Just like a massive dichotomy between what you want and what the reality is. And I think that's kind of what you meant to cover with your article.
00:01:42.618 - 00:01:59.122, Speaker A: So my kind of first question to you is, can you just give us a very brief overview of what some of these high level problems were, what you noticed, and kind of what made you write that? And then we can just list out all the types of theater and the drama we've seen in this space, and we'll kind of go deeper into each of them one by one.
00:01:59.256 - 00:02:17.014, Speaker B: Sure. So I'll give a context to my motivation. I gave this talk at ECC in Paris called Crypto Is a Theater, and it goes over all the different facets that I see going up.
00:02:17.014 - 00:02:50.542, Speaker B: And it's not so much that there were all these promises and we're not there yet, because that's understandable. It's about putting putting on the show. That's what just started really kind of getting to me, because it's okay to admit we're not there yet, but I don't think it's okay to not be transparent about it, especially because there's money involved and people are trusting these protocols and developers.
00:02:50.542 - 00:03:13.130, Speaker B: So those risks need to be more transparent than better known. And so these different theater performances that I'm seeing are decentralization theater governance Theater, community theater and DeFi musical chairs or like TVL musical.
00:03:14.110 - 00:03:21.710, Speaker A: Yeah, these are excellent headaches. I can't wait to get a jump fit. So let's talk about the decentralization theater.
00:03:21.710 - 00:03:29.470, Speaker A: How do you define decentralization and kind of where do you think people are sort of not being honest about something being decentralized?
00:03:30.050 - 00:04:07.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean it really comes down to the level of control that projects have over their protocol. And in the end, obviously this space is very early and most teams have really almost full control over their protocols. It's about how a small group of people in one room can unilaterally make upgrades to code without there having be any almost input from token holders or anything else.
00:04:07.978 - 00:04:39.686, Speaker B: It's this kind of god mode switch that protocols have and this is going on in most cases from DAP levels to layer two levels. And it's really important. There's like hundreds of millions of dollars at stake that can easily be put at risk by a very small group of people.
00:04:39.686 - 00:04:55.898, Speaker B: And so that's important because one, for regulatory reasons that's just like top of mind right now, regulators can easily come and censor or stop a protocol if it can be easily upgraded by a.
00:04:55.904 - 00:04:56.922, Speaker A: Small only a few people.
00:04:56.976 - 00:05:37.142, Speaker B: Yeah, and also just obviously puts user funds at risk. And we've seen many cases where there's some seed phrase compromise and millions of dollars are lost. And thirdly, if we are here to be the future of finance, the future of the internet, which I do believe is the case, there's no way that institutions like the trillions of dollars that flow through the financial system are going to trust this infrastructure when again it can be upgraded by a handful of people.
00:05:37.142 - 00:05:42.698, Speaker B: There's no way we're building the future finance in the right way if this is what's behind it.
00:05:42.864 - 00:06:03.646, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Do you in this situation consider the cases where certain people have a massive amount of tokens and they're still using that to vote for a decision on these Dows? Or is it purely the fact that some people or some protocols are unilaterally just making decisions without actually obeying how.
00:06:03.668 - 00:06:32.886, Speaker B: They yeah, it's like the degree of control via different tools. Some of it will be through these just like upgrade switches, some of it will be through governance, some of it will be through just having a very centralized network with very few validators or very few nodes. So yeah, there's like different ways of controlling adapt or a protocol understood.
00:06:32.998 - 00:06:59.918, Speaker A: So obviously that's not a good place to be in if your hard earned money can just be put in a different direction or wiped away from just a handful of people making decisions on the Whim. What is a kind of good way for us to identify these situations? Do you have a proposal or a way to understand if something is in that theater category for being decentralized.
00:07:00.094 - 00:07:08.982, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I can go through the other types of theater and then absolutely sure, we can go into like this.
00:07:09.036 - 00:07:10.290, Speaker A: Let's talk about governance theater.
00:07:10.370 - 00:07:33.914, Speaker B: Okay. All right, so governance theater is similar, but it's about how ineffective Token based governance is right now. Effectively, what's happening is that governance Tokens are basically a proxy for equity.
00:07:33.914 - 00:07:45.294, Speaker B: I mean, that's what people are really using governance Tokens for. If you're buying a Token, most of the time nobody's interested in actually governing a protocol.
00:07:45.342 - 00:07:47.454, Speaker A: They just want to own the Token.
00:07:47.502 - 00:08:24.378, Speaker B: They just want a piece of whatever adapt is the Token. And the way that we see it objectively is because in the end, it's like the teams and maybe the teams and their investors, the ones who are participating in governance and driving all decisions. So there was a study a couple of years ago that showed that 1% of Token holders of the major DeFi applications own more than 50% of governance or like, delegated governance votes.
00:08:24.378 - 00:08:25.358, Speaker B: I mean, that's 1%.
00:08:25.444 - 00:08:27.082, Speaker A: That's a massive variance.
00:08:27.146 - 00:08:48.840, Speaker B: Yeah. So obviously, Token based governance is not working, and it's creating this horrible system of plutocracy where even if it was working the way it's set up, it's set up so that effectively, those who have the most capital have the bigger say.
00:08:52.570 - 00:08:57.458, Speaker A: One Token, one vote isn't really a good strategy if it's already unfairly distributed.
00:08:57.554 - 00:09:22.346, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. That's kind of this governance theater. And it's a theater because if you know that your DAP is being run by a small group of people, don't put on this show of going to snapshot and being like, oh, we have community governance, we'll put up this proposal.
00:09:22.346 - 00:09:32.350, Speaker B: When you know that you're going to control it, you have 99% of the votes, you're going to say yes or no. So this really gets to me. It's like, just make your decision.
00:09:32.350 - 00:09:46.360, Speaker B: Just run this DAF like a startup like you are. And when you have greater distribution in your Token, then maybe set up an actual decentralized governance, but don't do it now. It's like you're wasting everyone's time.
00:09:46.890 - 00:09:52.410, Speaker A: In this case, instead of governance theater, it's better to actually move it back to decentralization theater.
00:09:54.910 - 00:10:07.902, Speaker B: My whole point is there's nothing wrong about being centralized at first. You're running a startup, effectively, you want to become decentralized, you can't do it on day one. So just be transferred about it.
00:10:07.956 - 00:10:11.022, Speaker A: Don't put up the show if you already know what the outcome is going to be.
00:10:11.076 - 00:10:20.850, Speaker B: Yes, don't put up the show. It's offensive for those watching. And then community theater.
00:10:20.850 - 00:10:41.290, Speaker B: This is mostly kind of my criticism of how the whole NFT space developed, which has become so cringe to me. It's like all this talk about community, community. In the end, there's very few authentic, real NFT communities.
00:10:41.290 - 00:10:48.438, Speaker B: Most of them, they're about creating these fake exclusive, fake exclusivity.
00:10:48.534 - 00:10:49.658, Speaker A: Discord is not a community.
00:10:49.744 - 00:11:21.030, Speaker B: Yeah, discord is not a community. And having a bunch of people saying, when announcement, when partnership, when whatever, to have some sort of price movement, that's not a community either. And what happens is a lot of founders and influencers like to go on about, oh, we love the community, we love the community, but then they do a rug pool or they abandon the project and go on to the next thing.
00:11:21.030 - 00:11:45.770, Speaker B: And there's so many cases of this. So I think that it's just very, I don't know, immoral to just play on this high lofty goal of having a community and like, oh, no, we're here for the art and no, you're here for the money, and you can be transparent about it. So, yeah, that's my gripe with NFTs.
00:11:45.770 - 00:11:56.458, Speaker B: And then finally, DeFi musical chairs. In the end, DeFi, it's my thing. I love it.
00:11:56.458 - 00:12:06.870, Speaker B: I love the promise of it. Again, I do think this is the future of finance. I think this is the way where we can create a more open, global, transparent financial system.
00:12:07.020 - 00:12:11.910, Speaker A: And by the way, for those of you who don't know, that's why it's called the Defiance. That's the DeFi.
00:12:14.650 - 00:13:00.018, Speaker B: But right now, unfortunately, what's happening is DeFi is this game of musical chairs where money is being cycled around the same group of people who are chasing the best yield, and there's no new money coming in. So each protocol is trying to offer the best incentive to fight for the smallish amount of capital that's available. So it's kind of a disappointing state of things, but I have my caveats with this part of the facade.
00:13:00.018 - 00:13:20.262, Speaker B: But to go now that we've gone over the theater, there's still one magic solution. I think there's a lot to do here. I think governance is just like one very hard thing to solve.
00:13:20.262 - 00:13:29.486, Speaker B: I think there needs to be better design systems around this, and maybe identity is like the key piece missing, but.
00:13:29.508 - 00:13:35.810, Speaker A: Also, not every model will work for every project. It's going to have to be different to that need of that community.
00:13:35.960 - 00:14:36.034, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think it's like with governance, it's like basically, again, super early, there needs to be better systems designed, but about just coming with one part of the solution, because again, it won't be like a magic wand. Actually, after the ECC talk, I started really kind of thinking about all of this and about, okay, I'm mad that this is happening, but I should also be doing something about it. So I think this is the first time I'm publicly speaking, but I'm putting together something called the DeFi League, which will consist on a group of founders, thought leaders, researchers in DeFi to advocate for transparency.
00:14:36.162 - 00:14:36.838, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:14:36.924 - 00:14:54.758, Speaker B: Yeah. And we have a data partner here who will help put up a dashboard of metrics to help users just very clearly assess where the risks are. So this is just very early stages.
00:14:54.758 - 00:15:22.400, Speaker B: I've just been talking to the members of this group, but we have some really strong names on board and the ideas will get together. Put up this transparent, objective methodology. Think of like LTV for two, but for DeFi to have this very easy to scan place and see kind of okay.
00:15:22.400 - 00:15:28.520, Speaker B: Where the risks are, what level of.
00:15:29.210 - 00:15:36.210, Speaker A: One solution being casual public shaming, just casually, publicly shaming some of these protocols.
00:15:36.290 - 00:15:51.242, Speaker B: For putting up these no, again, there's no judgment on being centralized. Again, I think that's totally fair. But it's just like let's be open about it, let's disclose there is and users can make their decision.
00:15:51.242 - 00:15:54.000, Speaker B: I think it's perfectly fine to use a centralized absolutely.
00:15:55.570 - 00:16:24.242, Speaker A: Sorry, I was just joking. I think the outcome that you kind of pointed out from everything you've said and I've already previously talked about, is that it should be about the transparency that these things are happening instead of trying to hide it behind some other sort of goal. My kind of bigger question is, as you were looking into sort of understanding what's going on here, did you kind of get a good idea for why people put up with this type of theater?
00:16:24.386 - 00:16:40.990, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think it's a good reason. I don't think anyone is being intentionally just deceiving. But to me, I don't know, I think it's pretty clear it's regulatory risk.
00:16:40.990 - 00:17:02.020, Speaker B: I think that's the main reason why a lot of the design choices in DeFi happen in the first place. So I think like anons dows, like fee switches all of these things like valueless tokens. I mean, come on.
00:17:02.020 - 00:17:15.074, Speaker B: No, all of these things. Maybe part of it is like, okay, you're safer punt. But I think in many cases it's because you're trying to avoid, because of lack of clarity.
00:17:15.122 - 00:17:18.070, Speaker A: You feel like you have to do these things, otherwise you may be in trouble.
00:17:18.150 - 00:17:30.330, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And again, I think it's a valid reason to make these choices. It is scary to be in the US and be involved in crypto.
00:17:30.330 - 00:17:51.186, Speaker B: But I think what's become clear is that if I'm seeing through all this, gary Gensler is seeing through this. Nobody's fooling anyone. I think we have this image of regulators being old dudes don't understand.
00:17:51.288 - 00:17:52.642, Speaker A: They definitely understand what's happening.
00:17:52.696 - 00:18:02.680, Speaker B: Yes, they understand. They've had a long time to figure it out, to be knowledgeable. They are already knowledgeable about this space.
00:18:02.680 - 00:18:18.842, Speaker B: So I don't think anyone is fooling regulators. And so the point is, if regulators already know what's going on, then you might as well just build the thing that you need to build.
00:18:18.896 - 00:18:58.998, Speaker A: Then why put on the show if you already know this is not fooling anybody? Interested? Do you think that it's just a situation we're in where most of these performances, for lack of a better term, fall into that category, but some of them are genuinely trying to do the same things to actually get to a real community. How do you think about sort of them hoping that this is the outcome that they achieve because they have to do it this way versus just being very effort and saying, look, this is going to be centralized or these ten people are very involved and they're putting 40 hours a week. So we're going to trust their decision to make any future changes over time and then include more people.
00:18:58.998 - 00:19:06.378, Speaker A: How much of that do you think is manifestation versus like, oh, I have to kind of repeat this because somebody else repeated it obviously.
00:19:06.464 - 00:19:49.350, Speaker B: It's really hard to say the motivations of most people, I think, yeah, maybe some teams are like okay, we want to get to this point but now we're not. So we'll kind of say that we are because they want to get there and maybe they're not thinking about regulation but I find that a bit hard to believe. In the end, regulation is this huge looming presence, everyone's thinking about it and there's been this consensus that the way to get around regulation is to be fully decentralized or sufficiently decentralized has been kind of the meme.
00:19:49.350 - 00:20:05.440, Speaker B: But the reality is that there hasn't been any formal guidance saying that that's the case. So we don't know whether there is some degree of decentralization regulators are going to be okay.
00:20:08.370 - 00:20:16.260, Speaker A: Mean, it's a very tough spot to be in if you're starting something and of course you have no idea what can be effectively held against you.
00:20:16.630 - 00:20:25.380, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's awful. I think what regulators are doing in the US is awful. I think it's going to set the US back.
00:20:25.380 - 00:20:32.934, Speaker B: I was just hearing how Token 2049 feels like a bull market while here.
00:20:32.972 - 00:20:35.654, Speaker A: It'S like maybe we're all scared to leave the house.
00:20:35.772 - 00:20:45.786, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the shift is already happening towards Asia and it's such a huge loss for the US. So I think it's horrible what's happening here.
00:20:45.786 - 00:21:05.054, Speaker B: So I think builders in the US shouldn't cave to regulators again because it's useless. They're seeing through this. So let's just build for users, build stuff that actually makes sense and not because of what we think that regulators.
00:21:05.102 - 00:21:28.150, Speaker A: Will be passed is some unwritten rule that we're all worried about. One other kind of unfortunate thing here is that almost all of this or at least a supermajority of it affects DeFi more than any other community and that's where most of the opportunities are too. From how we actually make this more accessible as a technology to hundreds of millions of people, if not billions.
00:21:28.150 - 00:21:49.600, Speaker A: You already kind of talked about that it effectively is pushing the US back in this whole race. Is there any other practical advice that you have for DeFi founders on what they can do and kind of how they can make this better instead of sort of falling to the trap of repeating things that they think they have to do versus even if they don't agree with them?
00:21:51.250 - 00:22:14.120, Speaker B: No, again, I think it's building for the end user. I'd love to see more applications, maybe for just like regular, mainstream, non whale person.
00:22:15.930 - 00:22:18.266, Speaker A: Make something for people who are not wealthy already.
00:22:18.368 - 00:22:30.842, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think a lot of it will come. Like I said, I think there's pieces still missing. Like maybe insurance is a big piece that's missing identity is missing.
00:22:30.842 - 00:23:07.782, Speaker B: So with DeFi, I think right now, this kind of musical chairs criticism, I don't think there's much to do about it right now. And I think it's natural for it to be happening because of how early the space is right now. The people who can afford to be playing in DeFi or using DeFi need to have a really high risk appetite because of how unproven the space is.
00:23:07.782 - 00:23:39.060, Speaker B: So I think this stage in DeFi is where we test things out, where those who can't take risks are, where all these DAPs get battle tested and then maybe we graduate from this phase and the space can mature to allow more capital to flow in. So I think kind of, of all my criticisms, like defined musical chairs, I'm the one that's like, okay, I'm less.
00:23:39.510 - 00:23:40.942, Speaker A: Maybe it helps long term.
00:23:41.006 - 00:23:41.620, Speaker B: Yes.
00:23:42.710 - 00:24:15.470, Speaker A: Well, my kind of final question to you is that we kind of talked about all the four categories there what we think is not going well. And interestingly, everybody in this room is the audience that ends up being on the other side of those kind of performances. Is there anything that you would want to encourage them to do or not to in the future so that we can actually help correct for this sooner than hoping that all these things happen from top down? What would you like to kind of have them remember as they kind of take away some key points from this discussion?
00:24:17.570 - 00:25:01.280, Speaker B: So as a user, I think doing as much research as you can and not just like aping in anything with a high yield is really important. And I think as like a nontechnical person, there's a few things you can do. I think a very basic one is just very simply going for the protocols and DAPs that have been around the longest, those have been around the longest and haven't been had, are probably safer, that have more TVL in them.
00:25:01.280 - 00:25:05.486, Speaker B: Look for audits, but it requires you.
00:25:05.508 - 00:25:07.578, Speaker A: To have a certain expertise which is not helpful.
00:25:07.674 - 00:25:28.626, Speaker B: Yeah. If you are just starting out, I think it's just very simply don't put in more than you can kind of stand to lose. I mean, I think that's the safest way to approach DeFi right now if you're not that experienced.
00:25:28.626 - 00:25:51.274, Speaker B: But I think yeah, doing your own research, going for the longest standing, highest TVO protocols to start and then as you get more experience, maybe start taking on a little bit more risk. And obviously at the defined. We are here to provide all the information, news, updates on everything that's going on in DeFi.
00:25:51.274 - 00:25:53.626, Speaker B: So subscribing to us helps.
00:25:53.658 - 00:25:58.686, Speaker A: There we go. In your research, read the define so you don't know that something is not.
00:25:58.868 - 00:26:13.818, Speaker B: Hopefully, you know, this initiative of the DeFi League, this dashboard, I really hope it helps and provides kind of the necessary information and transparency to just help users make more informed decisions.
00:26:13.994 - 00:26:21.060, Speaker A: I can't wait for DeFi leak to be public. So thank you so much for telling us about this fairly and really appreciate this discussion. Yes.
