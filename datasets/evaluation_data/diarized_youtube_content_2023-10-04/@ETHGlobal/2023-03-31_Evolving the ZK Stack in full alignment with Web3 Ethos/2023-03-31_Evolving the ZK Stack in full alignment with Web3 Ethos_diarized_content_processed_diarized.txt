00:00:06.970 - 00:00:21.082, Speaker A: Great panel. And also just wanted to say that we encourage collaboration, and I'm happy that Barry actually mentioned that between the Ckvm roll ups. Now we leave Brendan and Vitalik in this panel.
00:00:21.082 - 00:00:44.998, Speaker A: We bring in Hudson, who's going to moderate the next panel. There you are. I just wanted to give a little parenthesis here that I wanted to thank the auditors that were in the previous panel and to also remind people that we have already published all the audit results and we have them available in our repository.
00:00:44.998 - 00:01:00.078, Speaker A: So encouraging people to come and take a look at those audit results. And this panel, I think it's probably one of my favorite ones. We're talking about evolving the CK stack, but more on the ethos side, the Web Three.
00:01:00.078 - 00:01:13.342, Speaker A: And here, I wish it could be part of this panel. Open source development, decentralization, all the stuff that we love and we keep here. So, Hudson, I leave you with your panel.
00:01:13.486 - 00:01:16.962, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Grace. Yes. So hi, everyone.
00:01:16.962 - 00:01:25.170, Speaker B: I'm Hudson. I work at Polygon Labs, and generally I'm an ethereum rascal on Twitter. Today we have a great set of panelists.
00:01:25.170 - 00:01:36.122, Speaker B: So many of them have already been introduced, but I'll go through the people who haven't been introduced. So mahalo. We know that guy Vitalik has stopped working on his master node to sneak into this call.
00:01:36.122 - 00:01:42.060, Speaker B: We'll accept him. We got david, what's your story? Just like an insert too.
00:01:42.770 - 00:01:53.930, Speaker C: Thanks, Hassan. Well, I'm one of the co founders of Polygon Zkvm, and I am basically leading the project and product side for a long time. So super excited about this launch.
00:01:53.930 - 00:01:55.854, Speaker C: Absolutely awesome.
00:01:55.972 - 00:01:56.670, Speaker D: Bob?
00:01:58.230 - 00:01:58.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:58.632 - 00:02:06.530, Speaker E: Hi. I'm lead of the Polygonmiden project, which know another ZK Pops project within Polygon.
00:02:07.510 - 00:02:09.330, Speaker B: Wonderful. And Anthony.
00:02:10.310 - 00:02:21.020, Speaker F: Okay, last but not least, and everybody's, Antoni. I am also one of the co founders of Polygon Jkvn, and in my case, I'm more focused on the operations and.
00:02:23.870 - 00:02:30.940, Speaker B: Gotcha. Gotcha. All right, this is going to be a really good panel because I looked over the questions and I made tweaks to make this more interesting a little bit.
00:02:30.940 - 00:02:39.280, Speaker B: So let's get started with the first one. So mahalo. Earlier this year, the Polygon teams got together to align on a common product.
00:02:39.280 - 00:03:01.190, Speaker B: Know, I saw the post on Twitter where it showed everybody sitting at a table. Would you like to share the vision of us with the Polygon ZK vision and where we are in the journey and where we're striving to go? Especially for the fact that when I talk to people about Polygon, sometimes they're like, yeah, Polygon is that thing with all the chains. So let us know what's going on.
00:03:01.340 - 00:03:04.934, Speaker G: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Hudson. It's a great one and very important one, of course.
00:03:04.934 - 00:03:45.542, Speaker G: So when we announced our strong commitment, a strategic bet, if you will, on ZK, roughly a year and a half ago, we were very much aware of the fact that, number one, this is very early stage of this industry. And number two, we're trying to build something which is highly complex, which has never built before and we didn't want to be opinionated from the beginning, hence why we joined hands with all these great people. And we have, until this very day, three formally independent teams, polygon Zero, polygon Hermes and Polygon Maiden, working under this wider polygon umbrella, if you will.
00:03:45.542 - 00:04:14.894, Speaker G: We have never regretted this choice. Actually the opposite, like the plurality differences in ideas, in approaches, in technologies primitives that these teams have been using and have expertise in, has significantly contributed to this milestone that we are shipping today. And it made Polygon Zkvm much more performant and enabled us to ship it years basically before people expect it.
00:04:14.894 - 00:04:55.462, Speaker G: So this approach has one negative side probably is that some people are confused in the wider community, right? Like, why does Polygon has these free approaches? What's going on here? But realistically and practically, this is one very strong, very coherent team with just different expertise and different approaches. But the team has been working very strong together and it has been a pleasure really participating in the process. That being said, the vision of Polygon when it comes to ZK is to establish this infinitely scalable, secure computational layer built on top of Ethereum.
00:04:55.462 - 00:05:25.794, Speaker G: So there will be multitude of chains, there will be even application specific chains like supernets that are part of our product suite, if you will. So the thing is, these all chains should be observed one day and should be tightly coupled, seamlessly interconnected to form one single, infinitely scalable, secure computation layer on top of Polygon. And that is our vision with ZK.
00:05:25.794 - 00:05:47.878, Speaker G: And we're, I think, progressing pretty well on that part. Now we already delivered, basically pulling on Zkvm. We are working on other interesting technologies to expand Ethereum beyond just scalability and we actually have the first formal proposal or implementation to interconnect all these chains.
00:05:47.878 - 00:06:01.520, Speaker G: That's something that we call Dell XLY Bridge that should actually enable exactly what I mentioned, turning these chains into one single execution layer on top of Ethereum. So, yeah, hopefully this is help.
00:06:02.370 - 00:06:07.806, Speaker B: Absolutely. Great answer. So David, this one is about open source.
00:06:07.806 - 00:06:33.050, Speaker B: So open source has always been a priority at Polygon. I've seen that the last few years as I've been an advisor and now an employee. So when you all shared the Zkevm repos last July at ECC, how is that an important step? And where are we today with open source? And just to add a little bit of spiciness, what's been the hardest part of that? Because I swear, every time I get into a discussion about open source licenses, there's like 30 to choose from.
00:06:33.050 - 00:06:38.794, Speaker B: So basically, where have we been, where are we now? And why did we choose this kind? Is it hard?
00:06:38.992 - 00:07:02.734, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks. Well, yes, it's a very hot topic, to be honest, because there's this kind of tension between making this as a contribution and becoming some project that's creating value for the whole community. In fact, ourselves as a project, we have been benefiting a lot from other teams innovation and contributions.
00:07:02.734 - 00:07:41.930, Speaker C: So we feel it's fair for us also to provide this to the community. In fact, the discussion about licensing is the second topic, which is do we do this permissive license or we use GPL? Because in the end we want to make sure that all this effort we did is useful for everyone. We can just provide this source code as something where community can just innovate iterate develop, and we will be very happy if the innovations of other teams will be also available for the future and for other contributions on other projects.
00:07:41.930 - 00:08:07.426, Speaker C: So, for us, the decision on license was to just provide GPL as the program GPL. Let's say the main components of the Ckbm, you will find them in the repositories today with Aperogbl version three. But there are other tooling, like the Jard explained, these tools to create this Haremization the Pill.
00:08:07.426 - 00:08:24.002, Speaker C: All these languages are an apparatus license, MIT, Apache two. So anyone can just use these tools to build anything with a different no commitment or license. And to the application they prefer more convenient, even if it's for private uses.
00:08:24.002 - 00:08:39.810, Speaker C: So we want to do this contribution. We feel very proud and very happy to finalize the project. But the second one is to do this openness of the contribution we did so far.
00:08:39.810 - 00:08:55.230, Speaker C: And we will continue working like that because as Jordan was saying, this is only the beginning of the project. So we'll continue in the open and in this open source license contribution. Give me the Hassan.
00:08:56.050 - 00:09:20.818, Speaker B: Wow, can I do this every time I do a presentation? Okay, anyways, thank you for that and hello, Vitalik. The next question is to you. So you mentioned earlier about stage one of kind of a roll up strategy in your brain and to progressively kind of give up centralization control, other mechanisms that might stop the progression of a roll up from being as powerful as it could be in the hands of the users.
00:09:20.818 - 00:09:33.340, Speaker B: So is there anything that a lot of the ecosystem is minimizing or overlooking when it comes to this process? The transparency involved, any hot takes that everyone's going to disagree with you on how to do it?
00:09:35.150 - 00:10:05.286, Speaker D: I feel like everyone agrees in theory, the bigger bottleneck is in practice, right? It feels to me like everyone is on board with the idea that, well, of course, roll ups should ultimately have proof systems that have teeth and be secured by them and move away from relying on multi sigs and all of this stuff. But in practice, there just are a lot of projects that claim to be.
00:10:05.308 - 00:10:06.950, Speaker B: Very close to that, but are actually.
00:10:07.020 - 00:10:26.060, Speaker D: Much further away from that. And there's different degrees of, I guess, egregiousness of this sort of thing. And there's different degrees of well intentionedness versus actually never having the intention of decentralizing at all.
00:10:26.060 - 00:10:53.700, Speaker D: And I think the bigger thing is to kind of just standardize and sort of lay down the rules a bit so that some projects don't really have as much of an opportunity to kind of wiggle out and try to claim that they're basically decentralized when they're actually not. And also make sure that the projects that have done a good job of that are properly getting credit on that.
00:10:55.030 - 00:11:03.480, Speaker B: Got you. That makes a lot of sense. So what you mean is like basically practice what you preach and if you're not doing that there should be pressure applied basically.
00:11:04.110 - 00:11:13.850, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a good way to summarize. I haven't really seen big divergences and what people preach. I'm only seeing divergences and what people practice.
00:11:14.350 - 00:11:21.022, Speaker B: Gotcha interesting. Thank you for that. All right, so Brendan and Bobin y'all are both going to take this.
00:11:21.022 - 00:11:50.760, Speaker B: We'll go with Brendan first and then Bobbin can also add their thoughts or other takes. So as we celebrate the launch of the Zkevm on Polygon, the Polygon ZK team is asserting leadership in the space and with their open source ideals and safe execution. How are your respective projects within Polygon positioning for this and how are they embracing open source and the ideal vision of decentralization overall, the ecosystem? Where are we going?
00:11:51.930 - 00:12:04.378, Speaker H: Yeah, sure, I can start. I work on the Zero team. We sort of have a dual mandate which is to work on proof system R and D.
00:12:04.378 - 00:12:42.182, Speaker H: So we built Pocky Two and Starkey and incorporated a lot of those optimizations and advancements in the Ckvm and then we're also working on Ckvm stuff that we can maybe talk about in more detail in a couple of weeks. But I think for us, open source and decentralization is really important. I think that one of the most rewarding things that we can contribute to the Ethereum community, to the crypto community, is the concept of public goods that are freely and permissionlessly usable by everyone.
00:12:42.182 - 00:13:14.720, Speaker H: And so for us, it was really important to release our proving system optimizations under a really permissive MIT Apache license. And so I think that those decisions vary depending on whether we're talking about a full productionized system like a Zkvm versus sort of like an underlying proving system library. But for us, decentralization and open source are both core values and super important.
00:13:17.010 - 00:13:17.790, Speaker D: Bob?
00:13:18.150 - 00:13:29.058, Speaker E: Yeah, I would basically echo the same thing. I'm like a very big believer in open source. In fact, like, Polygonmiden project right now is under MIT license.
00:13:29.058 - 00:13:41.734, Speaker E: It was under MIT license from day one. And as permanent self, there is different considerations for something that is more kind of productionized versus something that is being a bit more experimental. But I do think there's a great benefit.
00:13:41.734 - 00:13:58.400, Speaker E: Like if you open it up to the community, you get a lot of feedback, you get people looking through their code base and all that stuff. So it's good on both ends, in my opinion. You let people use it, but you also get benefit of people using it and finding bugs and fixing and contributing back to you.
00:13:58.400 - 00:14:15.270, Speaker E: For me personally working under my license, that's what I've been doing for the last, I guess, three years. And I don't think I almost anything that under any other license and in terms of mining specifically. So, as I mentioned, it's another ZK project.
00:14:15.270 - 00:14:41.120, Speaker E: I think the way we're thinking about it is that one of the nice things about L Two is that this is where it can innovate and we are trying to explore other design approaches to the space. I think Zinc game is a super important and the crucial piece to have, but we also want to explore other state models that maybe better support privacy, better support local proof generation and things like that. So that is what we're exploring with my data at this point.
00:14:42.770 - 00:14:59.822, Speaker B: Awesome. Great answer. I would also say with this push for open source and I might get to this a little later with people if we have extra time, the thought of collaboration comes to mind, which is kind of an antithetical thought to how L Two S are working nowadays.
00:14:59.822 - 00:15:14.518, Speaker B: But before we get into that, I want to make sure that I get Anthony here because there's a question on Polygon ID. A lot of people don't know about Polygon ID. I feel like just because it's been being worked on and a lot of the other there's like a ton of different ideas on ID.
00:15:14.518 - 00:15:35.440, Speaker B: So what do you think about how Polygon ID upholds the web three ethos and the self sovereignty ethos that a lot of the web three and Ethereum projects share? And can you add more details on how this is being achieved in light of the work that you've done with Polygon ID? And I guess like a two sentence intro to Polygon ID would be nice too.
00:15:36.290 - 00:15:37.262, Speaker F: Okay, thanks.
00:15:37.316 - 00:15:37.882, Speaker C: Hudson.
00:15:37.946 - 00:16:20.966, Speaker F: Yes, I mean, Jordy, David and myself, we started our project with what was with identity and then at the moment we saw that in order to vote, we needed to scale. When Jordy started to vote on Hermes and how to scale on top of Ethereum, then yes. For us, we have seen in Calgary, where there is some problems with democracy, how important is to have self sovereign identity and the ownership of your data and the fact that nobody can censor you and you can be always on the ship side and managing your keys.
00:16:20.966 - 00:16:57.820, Speaker F: Then in our what now, today is the day of CKDM, but we have a lot of hopes on Polygon ID. That's our next big project and we are very focused and we have a lot of hopes on that. And the idea is that it should be the entry door to web three through your event, through that you can manage all your keys and you are able to access any kind of tab or any kind of any service that you require, but always ensuring this privacy level that the zero knowledge proofs are able to provide.
00:16:59.070 - 00:17:19.102, Speaker B: Awesome, thank you. I was going to add another question on that. So is there plans or current designs for a mobile interface or something that just really kills it on the user experience? Because that's like the number one thing I hear about when it comes to a lot of these ID solutions all in one wallets, things like that.
00:17:19.102 - 00:17:26.690, Speaker B: So there's already a fragmented ecosystem. What is polygon ID going to do to make it very accessible to users and non fragmented?
00:17:27.350 - 00:17:54.950, Speaker F: Yes, here, I mean, you are totally right and the polygon edit team is working very hard on the shadows, let's say in a rogue mode. Then now in July, we will see a lot of new features and then also parent of the Year. We should almost have the full stack or the major part of the new improvements.
00:17:54.950 - 00:18:03.550, Speaker F: And yes, this mobile aspect is something that we are working on. And yes, the idea is that in the next month it should be announced.
00:18:04.850 - 00:18:08.334, Speaker B: Awesome. That's great to hear. I'm definitely looking forward to it.
00:18:08.334 - 00:18:15.342, Speaker B: So I've run out of my prepared questions. So what I'm going to do is this. We're all going to take some time to do some closing thoughts.
00:18:15.342 - 00:18:21.998, Speaker B: You can spend a couple of minutes, it could be whatever you want. I'm not here to restrict you. This is a free space.
00:18:21.998 - 00:18:26.070, Speaker B: So we'll go ahead and start with let's start with David.
00:18:29.300 - 00:19:03.144, Speaker C: Well, I have open thoughts, but I would like to see that this solution of Ckbm becomes the first solution for developers because they understand what's behind this trust model that Vitalik was referring to. In the end, we were targeting projects to extend the decentralization, the security of Ethereum. It was not about centralizing.
00:19:03.144 - 00:19:16.912, Speaker C: Again, in layer two, it needs to be clear path towards decentralization, needs to be a clear strategy. We need to be transparent and verifiable. This is what we're trying to do with our model.
00:19:16.912 - 00:19:42.392, Speaker C: Not only open sourcing, but also being transparent in all these aspects. So users, developers understand and know what's the plan in our side, what's the kind of network they are just betting on. It's not only about equivalents or features or these kind of things about for me, respecting the ethos of web three in terms of decentralization and trust model.
00:19:42.392 - 00:20:10.956, Speaker C: So, next thing we will do is enable this force transaction, this force batch, because initially we have a single sequencer, but shortly after that we will have these force batches. Then we will target decentralization of previous generation and then we will target decentralization of sequencing. Why we address this improvement in security, this bug bounties, this maturity we want to achieve.
00:20:10.956 - 00:20:20.660, Speaker C: But from the inception we have these protocols and these ideas in mind. So we are making technical decisions that enable us to decentralize in the midterm.
00:20:21.560 - 00:20:25.700, Speaker B: Awesome. Great thoughts. I'll go ahead and give my like 30 seconds of things.
00:20:25.700 - 00:20:49.672, Speaker B: I think that the tech stuff at Polygon is amazing. One thing that I personally want to kind of get out as a message this year and one of the reasons why I joined Polygon Labs is that a lot of the stuff we're building in L, two scalability privacy stuff, et cetera is not a Sierra Sum game. As the founders of Polygon said from the first week it launched, there is no silver bullet to scaling.
00:20:49.672 - 00:21:24.820, Speaker B: And I think the future holds that there will be a lot of different solutions. So a lot of the things we've seen both from Polygon and other teams that kind of go back and forth with friendly debates and then getting more heated debates, I think a lot of that is going to change this year. So that Polygon, besides getting known for the most deepest, most interesting and most well built tech, also has kind of oh, they're the nice ones, they come in and help when another chain is having problems or going and being on stage with other chains and being more collaborative in other ways on panels, maybe sharing research designs.
00:21:24.820 - 00:21:33.550, Speaker B: Either way, how it ends up doesn't really matter. Just that there is a new vibe this year. 2023 is like a new Polygon vibe and I really believe in that.
00:21:33.550 - 00:21:36.220, Speaker B: Next up we're going to have Antony.
00:21:38.080 - 00:22:09.524, Speaker F: Well, in my case, I don't want also to repeat what David was saying. But I remember that when Jordy came to us, one of why I left my previous work and I decided to join him was the idea also to help be embarrassed in that case and how we could create a better world through decentralization, being censorship resistant, all this kind of quality. So then I feel that this is another step in that direction.
00:22:09.524 - 00:22:15.930, Speaker F: We are not yet there. Obviously I'm not going to be so late. There is a long journey still.
00:22:15.930 - 00:22:49.380, Speaker F: But today we are closing a cycle of three years almost when everything started, when Jordi came up with the first brilliant idea and I'm really proud of what we have done, knowing that we are not yet at the end of the road. For me, today is exactly a day to enjoy. Yes, it's one day where I think we are one step closer to this idea that we have of a better world, of a better society.
00:22:49.380 - 00:22:52.740, Speaker F: I think we are in the right direction.
00:22:54.120 - 00:22:56.100, Speaker B: Excellent words, Bobbin.
00:22:57.960 - 00:23:02.070, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say I actually like your idea absent about.
00:23:05.720 - 00:23:07.172, Speaker C: We're in this web three space.
00:23:07.226 - 00:23:15.212, Speaker E: Like we're all in this together. We need to collaborate with each other. I think we want to lead by example in this as much as possible.
00:23:15.212 - 00:23:27.264, Speaker E: And where we are collaborating, our tech can be used in other places and things like that. I think all of the Web Three space benefits from it. And in my mind this is a very important thing to achieve and strive forward.
00:23:27.264 - 00:23:38.108, Speaker E: So we want to build this and scale and provide privacy and all of that stuff. But we also want to preserve the Web Three because of collaboration and flexiology.
00:23:38.124 - 00:23:38.784, Speaker F: And all that stuff.
00:23:38.822 - 00:23:43.030, Speaker E: So for me, this is like a very important thing and I hope we can achieve it.
00:23:44.040 - 00:23:46.550, Speaker B: Awesome. Vitalik, what about you?
00:23:49.880 - 00:24:07.950, Speaker D: I'm just happy to see Zkvms becoming real. I'm happy to see Ethereum layer two scaling becoming fully real and not just something that's kind of theoretical. And there's these backdoors that you're not supposed to talk about.
00:24:07.950 - 00:24:41.320, Speaker D: It's a big improvement and I think over the next six to twelve months we're probably going to see yet even more big improvements on the horizon as both other layer twos start step up and get to stage one. And Polygon zone implementation continues to improve over time. And at the same time we get EIP 44, greatly increasing the amount of data space on chain and roll ups, hopefully moving quickly to take advantage of that.
00:24:41.320 - 00:24:54.380, Speaker D: So I'm excited to see all of those things happen and excited to really get to the point where we can start to call scaling a solved problem for Ethereum.
00:24:55.760 - 00:24:57.740, Speaker B: Wonderful. Brendan?
00:24:59.280 - 00:25:11.324, Speaker H: Yeah, I don't have too much to add. I would just say that the thing that I'm really struck by right now is just how far we've come. And like, Metallic was like, this was all theoretical.
00:25:11.324 - 00:25:43.130, Speaker H: Like three years ago, no one thought that this would be possible, and two years ago the narrative was like, oh, we'll never have general computations Ek roll ups. And then it was, oh, maybe we could get to EVM compatibility but never EVM equivalents. And it's funny because when we joined Polygon and we talked with Jordy about building an EVM equivalent ckvm we were sort of, you know, good luck with Mean.
00:25:43.130 - 00:25:53.420, Speaker H: We're not so sure. And so I would just say full credit to Jordy and the team. This is an amazing, astonishing accomplishment.
00:25:53.420 - 00:26:03.600, Speaker H: And, yeah, I think it just opens up this huge space of possibility for what we can do in crypto. And I think the next year is going to be incredibly exciting.
00:26:04.420 - 00:26:09.428, Speaker B: Completely agree. And last but not least, mahalo. I think we got like exactly a minute and a half left.
00:26:09.428 - 00:26:10.452, Speaker B: Go for it.
00:26:10.586 - 00:26:29.290, Speaker G: Thank you, Hudson, so much. I will abuse the opportunity to say two things instead of one. Number one, AI completely want to echo what you just said in that idea for Polygon 2023, which is more open, more helpful towards even other projects, including competitors, because as we all said, we are all in this together.
00:26:29.290 - 00:26:43.020, Speaker G: We have been heads down building and really passionate about what we do. And we tend sometimes to be a little bit self focused or a little bit closer than we should be. Right? But that's only because you are heads down building.
00:26:43.020 - 00:27:10.744, Speaker G: And sometimes maybe we get even a little bit defensive, maybe even on Twitter or whatever, because when you're passionate and you're really trying to do something the right way and then there are some doubts about that, then you tend to get sometimes a little bit defensive. But we should completely, hopefully change that in this year and really fully promote this ethos of collaboration and openness and being supportive to other projects as much as possible as well. That's one thing.
00:27:10.744 - 00:27:48.944, Speaker G: And the second thing, I would just like to zoom out just for a second and maybe revisit. Why are we doing all of this? Is this just a bunch of know, just trying to sheet some cool tech? And why are we doing all of this? And just to Anthony's point that he mentioned, and for me personally, this incredible idea of establishing this global network of value is absolutely mind blowing. So with the Internet, we have been able in these past decades to establish this global network of information and democratize access to information, right, and knowledge.
00:27:48.944 - 00:28:10.968, Speaker G: So 20 years ago, it was impossible to imagine that today anyone with the mobile phone and Internet access can attend an MIT course, learn to code, improve themselves and all of that. But many of these people don't have the opportunity to monetize now that knowledge or those skills or their talents. And that's why we need this global network of value.
00:28:10.968 - 00:28:35.936, Speaker G: Basically, we need this global permissionless economy that we are trying to build and this human coordination. And I'm sure it can I strongly believe, as all of the people here, that it can transform really our society in very profound and positive ways. So I'm very happy that today we have just one step closer to that grand idea.
00:28:36.038 - 00:28:42.244, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's excellent words. So, thank you so much. We are right on time.
00:28:42.244 - 00:28:52.790, Speaker B: So I'm going to see if Grace wanted to come back in for anything closing or if we just say, so long. Oh, you're muted. Grace doing the same thing.
00:28:53.580 - 00:28:57.076, Speaker A: Yes. So excited. I forget to unmute.
00:28:57.076 - 00:29:11.940, Speaker A: So thank you so much. This panel was exactly what I expected. I am so happy that we have emphasized the importance of the ethos that we live by in web three, and more importantly, how do we embrace them in polygon.
00:29:11.940 - 00:29:13.710, Speaker A: So thank you so much for wearing that.
