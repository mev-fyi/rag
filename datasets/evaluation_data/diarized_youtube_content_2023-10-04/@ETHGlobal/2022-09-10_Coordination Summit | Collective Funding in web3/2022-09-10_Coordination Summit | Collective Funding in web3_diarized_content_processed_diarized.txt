00:00:06.250 - 00:00:13.470, Speaker A: I'm super excited to welcome our next talk. And it's a panel. We're going to talk about collective collective funding in Web Three.
00:00:13.470 - 00:00:27.174, Speaker A: And as for our three amazing panelists, want to welcome Simone, James and Steph on to the stage. So I'll ask all of you to turn your videos on and we'll talk about some intro resting ways to do funding. So welcome everybody.
00:00:27.174 - 00:00:29.080, Speaker A: Excited to have you on board.
00:00:29.530 - 00:00:30.280, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:00:31.290 - 00:00:44.218, Speaker A: Looks like we're awesome. So we have 30 minutes for this, which means we will to go into too many questions. So we'll try to go into some direct topics as early as possible.
00:00:44.218 - 00:00:59.674, Speaker A: But I want to kind of zoom out first and just maybe start off with a couple of intros. I'd love to kind of start with Simona here. Tell us about who you are, what you work on and what is kind of the most common thing you end up doing as part of your role.
00:00:59.674 - 00:01:02.190, Speaker A: And we'll kind of then go to Stefan and James.
00:01:03.190 - 00:01:07.220, Speaker C: Cool. Hi everybody. Great to be here.
00:01:07.220 - 00:01:20.994, Speaker C: I tend to spin very many plates in the ethereum ecosystem. I am a steward of Gitcoin dao Meta governance. Steward for ENS.
00:01:20.994 - 00:01:55.600, Speaker C: I also work with Element Finance Dow as well as organize Shelling Point and Liscon. So there's a plethora of things that I get involved in, all aimed at potentially creating or making sure that Web Three is our new reality and creating space for a lot of people to come into that reality in a nice beautiful initiation and then a nice kind of path forward that everybody can benefit from.
00:01:58.710 - 00:02:01.250, Speaker A: Thanks. James, if you want to go next?
00:02:01.400 - 00:02:07.182, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So hello everyone. I'm James, I'm from FireEye's and from New Zealand.
00:02:07.182 - 00:02:20.818, Speaker B: Really focus on sort of like how we can open up the governance space and make it more approachable. And the best way that we do that is by working with a series of token launches and Dow launches. We're at the moment at MCON, if anyone's listening in at MCON, come and catch us and hang out.
00:02:20.818 - 00:02:32.910, Speaker B: But sort of really like focusing on how these Dows can expand. So how can Medicare bring in more people and give up more money? How can ENS and launch their token in a meaningful way and get other people involved?
00:02:34.290 - 00:02:38.480, Speaker A: Awesome. And steph. You're next.
00:02:39.250 - 00:02:44.546, Speaker D: Hey, I'm steph. I'm over at C Club. I am the steward of the media team.
00:02:44.546 - 00:03:06.310, Speaker D: And yeah, I spend my days thinking about and executing and facilitating media as a dao strategy. And yeah, I think Jess, our instigator and co creator, described me as someone who thinks about coordination more than most same people. And I feel like that feels pretty accurate.
00:03:07.370 - 00:03:17.260, Speaker A: Amazing. This whole day is about coordination and sort of anywhere from our learnings to our complaints. So I want to focus on both of those for the next few minutes.
00:03:17.260 - 00:03:32.746, Speaker A: I feel like the first topic we should all dive into is maybe talking about what is essentially the level of coordination we have to do. So, James, you talked about working with specific launches. Somebody talked about doing grants for multiple communities.
00:03:32.746 - 00:03:46.690, Speaker A: Steph, you're talking about just kind of a lot of companies that you get to look at and the media aspects of all those opportunities. These are different scales, these are different kind of timelines. You have a lot different set of people that are affected by these decisions.
00:03:46.690 - 00:03:59.400, Speaker A: Maybe starting with you, Steph, on average, what is the level of complexity that you're dealing with in terms of the number of people you have to talk to or coordinate? And what are some of these timelines that you usually end up working out on?
00:03:59.770 - 00:04:24.530, Speaker D: I love this. We're increasingly our coordination is becoming more interwoven and complex over at C Club, both as our teams grow in the number of people that we're coordinating with and also the depth at which we're coordinating. And I think also as we mature as a Dow, as a community, as an organization.
00:04:24.530 - 00:04:54.410, Speaker D: So, yeah, on any given day or sorry, on any given week, I'm in something like 14 plus hours of meetings that are scaled from either one to ones or syncs across multiple working groups or within our specific working groups. And, yeah, we're working on timelines. So if I think about with the media team specifically, we're working on timelines that are both like 24 hours long.
00:04:54.410 - 00:05:44.310, Speaker D: Right, because you're engaging in the ever on cycle of Twitter, just social media, but we also work on much longer timelines, right? So when we're talking about any media that we're putting out from our podcast to any of our editorials, that can be timelines that are like two months, three months, six months out. One of the things that we're also in the midst of on the media team, but then again also at C club at large is the way in which as we grow our teams, as we grow and add new verticals to our work, that our coordination and our need for clarity and legibility and constantly surfacing all assumptions just becomes so critical.
00:05:46.270 - 00:05:58.720, Speaker A: I can imagine. And I feel like I don't want to go to Simona next because you seem to be in the eye of the storm of every grant davao coordination here. So what's the chaos that you get to deal with?
00:05:59.490 - 00:06:24.360, Speaker C: Well, so I think just in general and how this has potentially evolved, we're still dealing with incredibly, incredibly daris centralized and gigantic kind of decision making processes, right. And we're definitely at that stage where it's very important to become much more agile and to make sure that.
00:06:26.490 - 00:06:26.854, Speaker D: We.
00:06:26.892 - 00:06:44.590, Speaker C: Set ourselves up for collective decision making. Right. And it's very important to decentralize that decision making process, and it's very important to prioritize enabling funding beyond what is a project and maybe have somebody who is good at marketing that project.
00:06:44.590 - 00:07:27.820, Speaker C: Right. So this, from the perspective of just an evolution of what it takes every single round for Gitcoin grants, the ones that go ahead are the ones that are just very good, constantly on Twitter and doing the usual kind of pre during and post grant engagement, let's say. So I think there's work to be done, particularly on that decentralization piece and particularly on that merit base, like really surfacing things in in a much more natural way versus, again, a little bit of that centralization and flavor that we're trying to get away from.
00:07:28.510 - 00:07:41.434, Speaker A: No, absolutely. This actually is a good segue into what I was going to ask next. But I also want to give James a quick opportunity to talk about this because that is effectively what we're going to touch on and how do we actually make that scalable.
00:07:41.434 - 00:07:43.806, Speaker A: So, James, I'll let you quickly chime in.
00:07:43.908 - 00:08:03.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I think plus one to what both Steph and Simona said, I think what's interesting at the moment in terms of how that coordination has leveled up, is that we're no longer sort of like coordinating ten people in a room. I mean, even with the Dow, right, like, five years ago, there wasn't that many people. There was a shitload of ethereum, right? Like 1015 percent of all ethereum.
00:08:03.250 - 00:08:19.078, Speaker B: But in terms of humans sitting around the table, there wasn't that many. And then sort of Ptsda for a couple of years now, we have sort of MetaCartel and mock spin up. A few more people come, and then now it's like the hot word, right? It's the buzword that literally everyone trying to get into seed Club is like, oh, I'm a Dow.
00:08:19.078 - 00:08:30.800, Speaker B: I'm an amazing dow. It's awesome. I think we are now at a space where it's a buzword, right, which is really good in a lot of ways because it means we have more humans, but it also means we have these coordination challenges that I guess like we're talking about right now.
00:08:32.690 - 00:08:55.426, Speaker A: Absolutely. It seems like there's one interesting thing here, is we often end up we're not establishing which side we're kind of talking about because oftentimes we have to switch context from, hey, we're on the other side of the people we're actually helping. And then sometimes, let's talk about the work we have to do to get to those outcomes.
00:08:55.426 - 00:09:16.746, Speaker A: And each of you are in that position where you're doing something on the internal side, and then you have external facing sort of outcomes. When you kind of look at that, what are some of the common challenges that you feel like you've seen or you think are still largely unsolved on the internal side? I'll maybe kind of start with you, James. Like, you have to kind of work with people on the launch side of things as they kind of think about new tokens.
00:09:16.746 - 00:09:31.266, Speaker A: How often are those not how often? What are usually kind of the common things you run into that repeat every time you talk to a new set of kind of clients and then we'll kind of go to simulina about some of the grants and the Dows you're involved with.
00:09:31.448 - 00:09:59.558, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's interesting. I think one of the most common things is probably not knowing when they should turn into a Dow. And I think the coordination of there now being 10,000 people, 100,000 people that really care about dows, I think sort of adds to that complexity, because at the beginning, it's like, oh, well, we'll just turn into a dow, and no one might worry about it for too long, but eventually we can sort of build on something more meaningful versus now it's like, okay, well, we can turn into a dow right now, and there might be 10,000 people.
00:09:59.558 - 00:10:12.414, Speaker B: Bang yard drum. But do we need that? Should we do that right now? And so I think like a common thing, we end up talking to a lot of different companies and a lot of them are like, okay, let's turn into a Dow tomorrow. And either they're trying to rush it too much and then it's chill the fuck out.
00:10:12.414 - 00:10:32.002, Speaker B: Sorry, I don't know if I like to swear chill out and sort of take it a little bit easier or they're so scared. Right. There's actually a lot of companies that we've spent a lot of time working with that we all use on a daily basis that were planning to launch a token years ago and didn't and went through months or years of work around launching that and then went, okay, this is too scary.
00:10:32.002 - 00:10:37.190, Speaker B: There's too much going on. And so I think that's sort of one of the most common things we end up finding.
00:10:41.150 - 00:10:42.218, Speaker A: Go for it.
00:10:42.384 - 00:11:13.378, Speaker C: So I think that's really interesting. And actually my kind of take on things was around timing as well. So I think that is such an important piece that we either and it seems like there's that speed of rushing in or pulling back and that in between that really nice middle is still something that we're all trying to figure out, right? It's either super quick, let's get all of the Dow tooling immediately, even if we don't need it right now, and let's figure things out later.
00:11:13.378 - 00:11:30.694, Speaker C: Or let's wait, let's see, maybe we don't turn into a dow, maybe we don't launch that token. Maybe we do this or think about it a little more. And I think the timing piece is really important both in the workings because you mentioned the internal workings of a dow, establishing those patterns.
00:11:30.694 - 00:11:53.962, Speaker C: I've been chatting about patterns and cadence and all of these rhythms of how things evolve, of how information flows, of how processes get implemented to make sense for that organism. If you look at it all, it's all each Dow or each structure is an organism within itself. Everything has to flow in a healthy way.
00:11:53.962 - 00:12:32.954, Speaker C: Everything has to touch the different components and the different parts through the arteries that link everything together. And making sure that that functions, that's a very important piece internally. On the other side, when you're looking at funding, when you're looking at how people are coming in and how they're accessing resource, being able to do it in a grassroots way, being able to do it in a way that has such a better degree of visibility versus the big institutional funders, the monolithic institutional funders that, dare I say, they also follow patterns.
00:12:32.954 - 00:13:06.498, Speaker C: But that's because they kind of go on a surface level sometimes. That a grassroots approach just completely not necessarily goes against, but gives you that granularity and gives you that feel for true value for an ecosystem that you may not have insights into. And so, again, micro to macro, macro to micro, it's not that different from the natural world and plants and all of these beautiful natural things if we just approach it from that perspective.
00:13:06.498 - 00:13:10.780, Speaker C: A lot of things become a lot clearer in timing as well as.
00:13:13.630 - 00:13:25.710, Speaker A: Steph. Your day to day is a little bit different than James and Simone is in kind of the role. What are kind of some of the parallels you've seen on the process side of things for C Club?
00:13:26.450 - 00:14:21.386, Speaker D: Yeah, I love how you're just getting to the heart of the matter, right? What is the tension between how we're integrating process internally and then how that then bleeds out into external and then also when we're interfacing with projects or with applicants for the accelerator or yeah, I mean, I think that there's a lot of things that feel resonant in what both James and Simona said. And when we're thinking about coordination, I think there's a way that we as a space talk about how we coordinate a community or how we make decisions as a community around a shared treasury. And one of the things I've noticed, and I feel like we're bringing more attention to at C Club as well, is like, oh, actually, there's already a really core community here, and those are your core contributors.
00:14:21.386 - 00:15:13.390, Speaker D: And so how are we as a contributing team, both within our specific working groups and also across our working groups, how are we coordinating and how are we making decisions? And then also, how are we memorializing those processes? And then how are we to Simone's point about cadence, how are we integrating a sense of cadence and evaluation and retro to all of those processes? That stuff's just not super sexy. When I said earlier, yeah, I'm in 13 hours of meetings a week, it's like, yeah, that's not a super exciting stat, but what happens in those meetings is actually really powerful. The power of a 30 minutes one to one and what can be accomplished in terms of connection and coordination in this off chain way is actually really critical to then bringing that coordination to on chain and then also how we accelerate that coordination for the DAOs that come through Seed Club.
00:15:15.010 - 00:15:36.440, Speaker A: So does this mean that you're essentially focused on decentralized decision making, but from a process standpoint, what matters is still kind of behaving like any coordinated community would, which largely resembles a centralized sort of controlled kind of party. Is that a fair question to either of you?
00:15:38.350 - 00:15:51.622, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I'll take the first pass at that. Yeah, I think that we think about decentralization. I think it's very easy for us to say decentralization on the other side of that is centralization.
00:15:51.622 - 00:16:27.560, Speaker D: And I think that's actually not a super useful way to think about decentralization, right, that it can be this circular spectrum with hella gradients and there are certain things within your Dow, within your community that might be fully decentralized, whatever that actually means. And there are certain components that have higher touch or more sort of quality control or curation or quality assurance or curation that those processes go through. And I don't necessarily see that as centralization, so to say, but I do see it as a really actually critical part of having a fully aligned decentralized community.
00:16:28.970 - 00:16:30.790, Speaker B: I'm down to go. Simone.
00:16:31.370 - 00:17:29.722, Speaker C: I was going to say for sure with the gradients, I mean, it's the way we need to approach this whole thing because otherwise we're all going to lose our minds and go like, why are we not there yet? What the hell? So being like jumping straight from a way of doing things that works to a decentralized way, right? Like look at Grants, right? There's the decentralizing, the grants protocol, right, and making that a tool for any community to use to fund whatever it is that they care about. That's the level of independence and decentralization that you aim for. But there's no way that you're going to be able to do it unless you would have gone through these, whatever, 15 grants rounds that Gitcoin has put up to see how it evolves and to see how it grows and to see how people are using it and what gets funded, right? So it's like that progressive way and path that you build.
00:17:29.722 - 00:17:45.090, Speaker C: It's almost like, you know, those movies where the track isn't built yet, you're like, building it as the train is going is basically what we're doing and that's totally fine and we should be comfortable with that and it's going to take a minute sometimes, but it is a progressive effort.
00:17:45.830 - 00:18:03.142, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. And I think that in current times, with whatever the number going down and Dows not executing as well as some people would like them to, I think there's this massive wave at the moment of people being like, oh, we should just go back. These corporate structures are actually really important.
00:18:03.142 - 00:18:14.346, Speaker B: They're being emulated and these committees that are being spun up. And some of that stuff is true. And there certainly is learning from the corporate world and the idea of making a grants committee right, and that being a centralizing force makes sense.
00:18:14.346 - 00:18:31.086, Speaker B: But actually, that doesn't mean we're taking a step away from the dow stuff. And I think everyone's roasting tokens and roasting dows right now, I think should take a step back and have a guess where we're going to be in five years. And it's going to be that actually a lot of this corporate structure is being consumed by these dows, whether anyone likes it or not.
00:18:31.086 - 00:18:38.450, Speaker B: And so the current Dow wave, yes, we are centralizing in some ways. However, we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
00:18:39.030 - 00:19:14.240, Speaker C: The main thing there, I would point out is adopting these things or making sure that we evolve this in a mindful way. Like don't just go oh shit, it's not working yet, let's just bring whatever it was from the corporate world and just jam it into the dao ecosystem. Do it in a mindful way, take what makes sense, do not just move it as if you're like navigating I don't know, Europe with a map of the states and then you're getting frustrated that you can't find where you're just don't do that.
00:19:15.010 - 00:19:39.526, Speaker A: No, of course. I mean it's also one of those things where when you are changing kind of the recipe but rather actually you have different ingredients but a different recipe that you're trying to get or same recipe trying to get to you're. In a lot of those scenarios where I feel like the good thing here before I finish on is seems like all four of us are aligned on what each of us are saying.
00:19:39.526 - 00:19:55.530, Speaker A: I don't disagree with anything that's been said so far, even though I would like to. But there are also some benefits of kind of being able to actually cherry pick things that are working and implement them in any new process and there are a lot of advantages of that. There's nothing wrong with having a meeting.
00:19:55.530 - 00:20:26.210, Speaker A: There's still a range that you get to sort of realize that there's like diminishing returns that you kind of get to but kind of asking point blank, do you think the Dows are efficient right now to kind of actually support a fast paced development of any kind of outcome? Obviously you can't generalize that, but for the ones you represent, the ones you've seen do a good job or not a great job, what do you kind of think that generally trends as and where do you think there's room for improvement?
00:20:28.970 - 00:20:56.010, Speaker B: I'm happy to start. I think that compared to what I guess would be my thought, yes, they are doing really well and certainly all the ones that every sale I'm involved in is perfectly efficient. But I think compared to what I think compared to what we were doing on the previous cycle, which was raising tokens and having no community voice and then the founders just spending the money and then piecing out compared to that, yes, much more efficient.
00:20:56.010 - 00:21:13.278, Speaker B: The Dow treasuries are locked up, the founder can't run away with the money well, there's some of the situations that the community are actually coordinating. The thing is working. And I think, yes, there's still a lot to be learned and yes, coordinating whether it be working groups or whether it be the way we distribute grants or the way that we coordinate decision making, all those things can be improved.
00:21:13.278 - 00:21:20.870, Speaker B: But compared to any version of reality that's existed in crypto for the past couple of years, I think we're like winning massively.
00:21:22.810 - 00:21:58.578, Speaker C: 100%. And for me, the proof is genuinely in the proverbial pudding because you mentioned ingredients making recipes. But what, for instance, in grants like season 14 of Gitcoin Dow, there was after because of the market and because of the different kind of circumstances, there was such scrutiny on how much money was coming out of the treasury to fund what work.
00:21:58.578 - 00:22:13.382, Speaker C: That it went into this such valuable conversation and at times even disagreements within that community for the benefit of that dow and the work that it is doing.
00:22:13.516 - 00:22:13.862, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:13.916 - 00:22:46.658, Speaker C: And having those conversations, like James says, in an open forum, in a transparent way, in a very animated way, which for me was a pleasure to be able to be a part of and witness, where you genuinely have people in a community caring about the future of something that can continue funding public goods and can continue its mission. And that opportunity I don't know. I have not witnessed it before.
00:22:46.658 - 00:23:32.080, Speaker C: And just being able to be part of that and then create the processes that come out of that and making sure that you strengthen that and create the space for those conversations to exist and for that pattern of decision making, collective decision making to happen is huge. It's a milestone as far as I'm concerned, in how we're moving them, how we're evolving them and how we're getting better and making sure that these things are clear, they are very accessible, they are very transparent in terms of the flows, in terms of who's involved, in terms of what we're doing with. So yes, from me.
00:23:34.710 - 00:24:05.180, Speaker A: I want to maybe ask an adjacent question to steph kind of compared to what I would say a lot of what Simona's in James day to day looks like you are investing in companies or Dows and generally kind of you have a different way of thinking about how do you measure anywhere from success to track outcomes. What are kind of some of the perils you've seen from how you work at C Club versus what anywhere from like a venture capital firm would do or other Dow initiatives you've seen around?
00:24:06.350 - 00:24:24.930, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. I think a critical point there to just to clarify is that at C Club we don't invest in any Dow or community. The thing that we do offer though through the accelerator is an investment of social value and then also knowledge acceleration.
00:24:24.930 - 00:24:59.734, Speaker D: I think this question of efficient are Dows efficient at outputs? I think it's such a fascinating question. It feels like it's almost a holdover a little bit from web two and from this idea of escape velocity and just like constantly up and to the right that it's true that we do need to be able to allocate this capital that we're able to pool really quickly because of this new technology. And I think that the real innovation actually does lie in how we allocate that capital.
00:24:59.734 - 00:25:30.950, Speaker D: Right. And so at seed Club, the value or sort of the investment that we're able to offer is around that piece of innovation. It's like how are you actually thinking about allocating that capital to your community and bringing value back to your community? And then also what are the most innovative ways to build with your community and to create meaningful work together? It's a more quality level type of investment and it is very high touch.
00:25:30.950 - 00:25:43.466, Speaker D: Right. And it's a little bit along the lines of do things that don't scale and do things that are actually going to be really aligned and produce something that's really of quality and also aligned with the ultimate value proposition of web three. Right.
00:25:43.466 - 00:25:48.060, Speaker D: Which is the democratic opportunity for ownership of these networks that we're building.
00:25:49.150 - 00:25:49.514, Speaker B: No.
00:25:49.552 - 00:25:50.140, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:25:51.790 - 00:25:52.154, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:52.192 - 00:26:28.358, Speaker A: And I guess in that goal everybody is aligned because kind of compared to the alternative which you kind of talked about, there are no other avenues where you get the same opportunity and not even just the binary notion of having the opportunity not but also at the scale which you don't get to sort of pursue. And that is definitely unique here and we're kind of figuring out how do we actually behave as individuals, whether it's representing the values to representing kind of the outcome. So, sounds like we need a second talk sometime in the future to figure out how do we actually track if we have been actually progressing or not.
00:26:28.358 - 00:26:38.234, Speaker A: I do have a couple of smaller questions. I'll kind of start off by maybe asking each of you. There's about 1500 hackers, actually 1700 hackers for this event.
00:26:38.234 - 00:26:57.906, Speaker A: They're building a lot of incredible tools for usually things that they're excited about. But as you kind of go about your kind of day to days here, what are some of the missing things you've seen that would really benefit whether it's on the tooling side or processes side or just things that developers can do to help make your lives easier? What kind of comes to mind, I.
00:26:57.928 - 00:27:19.958, Speaker B: Think, well, maybe some alpha from MCON this week is that everyone is talking about verified credentials. And to me that's been the very clear end of governance from the beginning is you have this liquid token that anyone can buy and then you have these credentials that are slapped on top based on your expertise or how long you've been involved and that gives you more governance weight. Right.
00:27:19.958 - 00:27:31.626, Speaker B: As far as I'm concerned, that's the end state of all tokens across the ecosystem. And I think it's been insane. The level of buzword that verified credentials or whatever else we're going to call them, has been this week.
00:27:31.626 - 00:27:43.214, Speaker B: And I think that any builder listening or hanging out, building around that topic, I think is a very interesting space, which is basically Soulbound NFTs, right? They're all the same thing. Non transferable Dow shares. It doesn't matter which way you spin it.
00:27:43.214 - 00:27:50.980, Speaker B: The idea that your address can sort of have some reference which can be used inside of governance or other coordination efforts, very sick and going to become very important.
00:27:54.230 - 00:28:37.890, Speaker D: Yeah, something that I think about all the time, especially from the media end at C Club, but it also infiltrates. I think everything we do in Dow work is how can we actually communicate directly with our token holders? Whether that's an ERC 20 or an ERC 721, how can you actually get that direct connection to those token holders? And it seems like a very sticky and also slippery area of work, right? Because you then get into this whole rabbit hole of just like, data. How you capture that data, how are you storing it and what are you doing with it? But I think that there is a real rich opportunity there to figure out how we can directly communicate and add value to the folks who hold tokens.
00:28:39.350 - 00:28:43.838, Speaker C: I actually think that was a project at Eat New York cardika.
00:28:43.854 - 00:28:48.870, Speaker A: It was one of the final it's a recurring theme that I would say largely remains unsolved.
00:28:49.770 - 00:29:22.574, Speaker C: So that's a really good point and I think both of those it's really interesting to reflect on how much we've been playing with these things throughout the years. And now, finally, we're getting two stages where potentially the tech is ready and the people are ready and the ideas are there to actually make them something that does provide value, right? We've done this so many times. Like, I remember there are so many different experiments that we were doing with reputation and that gives you this.
00:29:22.574 - 00:29:49.162, Speaker C: And you can do this with if you have this token that's minted for this project and so on. I mean, God, I was doing this stuff in 2018 and people were like, what? But it's very important to look at. Actually, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give a kind of bit of advice or a prompt for everybody building, I would say, elevate your intentions about what you're building.
00:29:49.162 - 00:30:14.898, Speaker C: Don't just build something that is, I don't know, done before, or something that is buzzy or something that is on trend. Build something that you genuinely care about, that your community, the community that you come out of cares about. Look at something that can generally make things better for whatever it is that you're interested in.
00:30:14.898 - 00:30:40.280, Speaker C: And elevate that intention so that it does become something that moves us, that step further into what we're trying to do here, which is. Dare I say, enable access to resource for everybody and redesign the little lines in the sand or in the cement that we have just been forced to live with for so long. That would be my kind of prompt for everybody.
00:30:41.950 - 00:30:54.246, Speaker A: Very timely and wise. All right, last question, and we'll kick this off to the next talk. But how can people get involved in your community? I'll start with Steph with C club.
00:30:54.246 - 00:30:57.678, Speaker A: What's the best way for people to find out and plug anything you'd like?
00:30:57.844 - 00:31:20.482, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, you know, definitely of follow us on all the socials right Twitter, get into our newsletter, find us on discord, get in there, introduce yourself. And also if you're a dow builder, if you're a community builder, apply to the accelerator. We're just in the process of finalizing our next cohort for SEO five, but there will be an SEO six, there will be an SEO seven and onward.
00:31:20.482 - 00:31:31.180, Speaker D: And we really want to see excited, new, innovative builders come through. So we're at C Club HQ on Twitter and you can find us all the places from there.
00:31:33.070 - 00:31:54.794, Speaker B: James yeah, I'd say the best way to get involved is to participate in Wildfire, which the best way to do that is go to my Twitter and it's a pinned Tweet blockchain. James and that's sort of a governance collective. There's 1000, OD people in the discord, but sort of fork key working groups focused on twelve OD, 13 OD different projects, the likes of ENS that we're speaking earlier.
00:31:54.794 - 00:32:13.880, Speaker B: Optimism Seed Club is sort of lightly tied in, but there's actually a lot of opportunity here. And if you're keen to join any of these dows and any of these know whatever your skill sets are, go into the discord and just spam them and start adding value. And you will be, you know, hit me up on Twitter and say, hey, I'm doing something cool and I'm not getting free tokens, and I'll abuse you.
00:32:13.880 - 00:32:16.040, Speaker B: Thanks guys.
00:32:17.770 - 00:32:26.858, Speaker C: And kind of same pattern. Twitter has all of the handles of all of the different things. I'm just at SIM underscore Pop.
00:32:26.858 - 00:32:38.798, Speaker C: One of the main things that I would say, check out kernel. They have very good cohorts of onboarding into web three for individuals and teams. It's a great program.
00:32:38.798 - 00:33:00.414, Speaker C: It's that initiation that kind of leads you through learning about web three, but also from a very principles aligned way, which, because I mentioned elevate intentions, that ensures that you'll learn about things in a very good way. Obviously, gitcoin there's a link there. Get into the discord.
00:33:00.414 - 00:33:08.838, Speaker C: There's so many different working work streams. There's so many interesting things that those guys are doing. And then, yeah, everything's in there.
00:33:08.838 - 00:33:10.642, Speaker C: So, yeah, good luck.
00:33:10.706 - 00:33:18.806, Speaker A: Thank you for thank you. Simona james and Steph and really appreciate you going over and having this amazing conversation with us.
00:33:18.908 - 00:33:20.146, Speaker D: Thanks, Kartik. Thanks, James.
00:33:20.178 - 00:33:20.938, Speaker B: Thanks, Katik.
00:33:20.994 - 00:33:21.566, Speaker D: See you.
00:33:21.668 - 00:33:22.810, Speaker A: See everybody. Bye.
