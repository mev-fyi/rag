00:00:25.090 - 00:00:30.120, Speaker A: Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
00:00:30.120 - 00:00:38.200, Speaker A: Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
00:00:38.200 - 00:00:46.280, Speaker A: Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
00:00:46.280 - 00:00:50.280, Speaker A: Don't do it.
00:01:03.650 - 00:01:08.206, Speaker B: Welcome, everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global.
00:01:08.206 - 00:01:25.830, Speaker B: And I thank all of you for your patience on us getting this started. This is the closing ceremony and the finale of ETH India 2022. This is an global event, and at East Global we want web three to win.
00:01:25.830 - 00:01:42.478, Speaker B: And ETH India is and this is the most incredible thing we've ever done. 2000 attendees from 321 different cities are here in this room. 44 of these are new to web three.
00:01:42.478 - 00:01:56.930, Speaker B: Just look at where people came from in just India alone. And we can't wait to show all of you what this weekend yielded. Not only that, this is officially the world's biggest Ethereum hackathon.
00:01:56.930 - 00:02:17.042, Speaker B: All these 2000 attendees worked on incredible projects. And our goal for the next hour and a half is to show some of those amazing demos and, of course, talk about all the amazing prizes. 459 projects came out of this weekend.
00:02:17.042 - 00:02:29.286, Speaker B: That is the most we have ever seen from any one of our events. And this is exactly why everything is running slightly behind schedule. Turns out that humans are not linearly.
00:02:29.286 - 00:02:46.222, Speaker B: Scalable. We learned so much in making this event from a logistical standpoint alone. I got excited about all the new challenges we can do, and I'm already thinking about how do we exceed this number for next year? So let's get the party started.
00:02:46.222 - 00:03:04.726, Speaker B: I want to first start off by thanking 45 of our incredible partners who were here this entire weekend, talking to everybody, working with all the teams, giving them feedback. So I'm going to try to do this thing as fast as I can, which means the faster you collab, the faster I'll save the logos. And three, two, one, go.
00:03:04.726 - 00:03:39.326, Speaker B: Thank you.

00:03:39.326 - 00:03:52.134, Speaker B: We're going to go through all of that in just a little while. Let's get back to these 459 projects. This was a behemoth of a task in just us reviewing and going through all of these things.
00:03:52.134 - 00:04:11.098, Speaker B: We had 46 incredible judges come in, scale up 20 parallel processes to go through all these projects over the entire morning and most of the afternoon and through all of their hard work. We are proud to announce twelve finalists. We're going to bring these twelve teams on here one by one.
00:04:11.098 - 00:04:34.414, Speaker B: They're going to demo what they built, and after that, we're going to talk about all the prizes that all of you have been waiting for. So please join me in congratulating these twelve teams. Web Three Rescue Chain Pay Block Alerts Bold Dpay Persona bot Detection sadave CI Proof of Trust ethguard Chart Swap trickle and Safeguard These are our twelve incredible finalists.
00:04:34.414 - 00:04:58.822, Speaker B: We're going to get started with bringing them on stage to show what they built and do a demo. And right after that we're going to go into all these prizes. But before we go into the first demo, I want to take a quick second to thank here the 447 teams who are not on that twelve list but still did an incredible amount of work this weekend.
00:04:58.822 - 00:05:21.730, Speaker B: Just because you were not one of these twelve teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong. Our goal was just to highlight something that all of our incredible judges and people in this space were excited about and that's who we bring on stage. But I want to congratulate to every single team here that presented, we really appreciate this and you want to congratulate yourself for doing all this incredible work over the past 48 hours.
00:05:21.730 - 00:05:34.838, Speaker B: Please give yourselves a big round of applause for just submitting a project which is a no easy challenge. A huge shout out to all of you. You can see all these projects on the Deaf Folio projects page website.
00:05:34.838 - 00:05:43.322, Speaker B: They'll soon also be visible on ETH global showcase. But enough of talking from me. Let's get started with our very first demo.
00:05:43.322 - 00:05:46.490, Speaker B: So please welcome web three rescue on stage.
00:05:56.340 - 00:06:01.116, Speaker A: Hey, hello guys. Team. At web three rescue we are building a solution.
00:06:01.116 - 00:06:12.600, Speaker A: Let's just see what's our problem. So problem is. All developers over here, you could have did one mistake that is committing your private keys to public repos at least once in a so.
00:06:12.600 - 00:06:32.456, Speaker A: And another mistake is at least writing your seed phrases somewhere and giving it to your users or maybe sharing your private keys within WhatsApp and by mistakenly showing this private key to someone. So there's this problem. So what we are today doing is we are going to rescue NFTs from your compromised wallet addresses.
00:06:32.456 - 00:06:43.548, Speaker A: So that's something which we are going to do today. We are going to rescue one rescue. We are going to perform a rescue today itself and live in front of you where we are going to bet a sweeper bot.
00:06:43.548 - 00:06:55.888, Speaker A: So what I will want you to know is just a minute about a sweeper bot. sweeperbot is someone who is monitoring your transactions. So if your wallet address is compromised, sweeperbot is monitoring the beam pool transactions.
00:06:55.888 - 00:07:08.888, Speaker A: So whenever any incoming transaction is there, let's just suppose it's of one ethereum. The Sweeper bot will instantly remove this out from your wallet by giving a gas fee of 500 guai. That's really high.
00:07:08.888 - 00:07:24.684, Speaker A: And for you to bid this you can't. So right now what we are going to do is we are going to show a wallet address which let's suppose it's an compromised address which any amount sent on that wallet address will be sweeped instantly. So now we are going to take a look at the exact rescue.
00:07:24.684 - 00:07:34.956, Speaker A: What happens is right now we are supporting five methods. Panic mode and ERC 20 collectibles. ERC 20 tokens ENS and smart contracts.
00:07:34.956 - 00:07:42.150, Speaker A: Wallet. Today we are going to rescue anchor token which is stuck inside an wallet address. This is the wallet address which is being stuck right now.
00:07:42.150 - 00:07:52.650, Speaker A: Yeah, let's just go for rescue. So a wallet address which is stuck right now starts with zero X. You can stay in front of you right now.
00:07:52.650 - 00:07:59.848, Speaker A: Hold on. Yeah, so we are pasting a private key. You can take this private key but it has nothing inside it.
00:07:59.848 - 00:08:09.948, Speaker A: So right now this is the private key which is having 30 anchor tokens inside it. Right now what we are going to do is we will also enter a safe address. Safe address is an address where you want your assets back.
00:08:09.948 - 00:08:18.800, Speaker A: So right now I am the compromised one. I want my safe address on some safe address address which is kind of secure. So we are going to enter the safe address.
00:08:18.800 - 00:08:26.916, Speaker A: Let's just go forward to an rescue click on yeah, that's it. That's it. You just have to enter that's it.
00:08:26.916 - 00:08:42.200, Speaker A: And what we will do is we will sponsor your transaction and everything is live on mennet right now. So what will happen? Actually we will be using making use of private transactions by flashbots. So what will happen? One of our wallets will deposit funds into your compromised account.
00:08:42.200 - 00:08:52.856, Speaker A: It will instantly remove your second transaction. That is transfer your anchor tokens from compromised account to your safe address. Both of these transactions will be happening in the same block.
00:08:52.856 - 00:09:00.892, Speaker A: So even if someone is monitoring your meme pool transactions, he won't know this is going to happen. And this is an instant transaction which will happen in front of you. Right now.
00:09:00.892 - 00:09:06.992, Speaker A: Let's just wait for transaction to be processed. Yeah, it says rescued successfully. Let's just take a look at what happened.
00:09:06.992 - 00:09:14.496, Speaker A: Exactly. So I am going towards an Ether scan right now. As you see, we were having one token which was around 30 anchor.
00:09:14.496 - 00:09:43.588, Speaker A: As you remember what happened, a wallet address named as rescue web three e put inside it put a transaction, it sent around 0.1 Ether and in the second transaction if you see all those NFDS were transferred, sorry, ERC 20 tokens to the safe address and this all is burnt done within the same block number. So if you see the block number ends with the same ending 016016.
00:09:43.588 - 00:10:01.756, Speaker A: So in this way you can just perform any kind of transaction which you weren't able to do because your private key was hacked when someone is sweeping your ETH from it. So right now you can do this, you can do any kind of ENS rescue, any kind of contract transactions, any kind of things like that. You can also remove your staked assets.
00:10:01.756 - 00:10:20.464, Speaker A: So if you have staked something right around into some kind of LP tokens or anything or somewhere, they are going to be unlocked after an ear. So what you can do is you can use this platform and rescue those tokens instantly and send it back to you. And what I'm mentioning is you can also claim the rewards alongside.
00:10:20.464 - 00:10:28.270, Speaker A: So over here you can just literally do any kind of transaction which you weren't able to do normally. So this product r solves this problems.
00:10:40.960 - 00:10:51.648, Speaker B: All right, please give them a big round of applause. Going first is not easy and this worked flawlessly. All right, next up we're going to bring on Proof of Trust, our second project finalist of the day.
00:10:51.648 - 00:11:01.830, Speaker B: Please give Proof of Trust a big round of applause. And we're going to have to do a quick switch on laptops. So let's hope that Murphy's Law doesn't kick in.
00:11:04.280 - 00:11:15.320, Speaker A: Just checking the clock. Can we get started? All right, GM friends, I know it's not morning, but we are crypto builders. That's how we introduce enroll.
00:11:15.320 - 00:11:30.904, Speaker A: We are basically hackers and builders from Nord Finance and our project is called as Proof of Trust. So before I elaborate, we have this, which kind of is a very quick and short kind of graphical summary of what our project is about. I don't think I need to describe this any further.
00:11:30.904 - 00:11:50.356, Speaker A: All of us are aware of what it is. Essentially what we're trying to do is change this around, right? We are trying to build a Proof of Trust protocol layer that every single centralized exchange out there can kind of take inspiration from, if not directly implement. So as to that, we are able to prove the solvency of all the major large cryptocurrency centralized exchanges that are out there.
00:11:50.356 - 00:11:59.956, Speaker A: So in this, right, like we have two main parts of it. What is essentially that proving solvency. There is proof of reserves and then there is proof of liabilities.
00:11:59.956 - 00:12:14.510, Speaker A: Reserves is essentially proving that the exchange has enough funds, while liabilities is accounting for all the various deposits, investments, et cetera, that have been done on the chain by itself. Sorry, on the exchange by itself. So now we're going to run down through a quick demo of this.
00:12:15.120 - 00:12:15.580, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:15.650 - 00:12:39.328, Speaker A: So as we know, right, currently how the things working, all the exchanges are trying to prove their reserves. And just let me go through one of the way they're doing it. So recently, last week, only finance has proved their reserve by transferring 123K BTC, right, to some public address and at particular timestamp, and that timestamp was defined by an auditor.
00:12:39.328 - 00:12:54.212, Speaker A: So problem in this one is first like Binance has to transfer that much amount to that particular address. So unnecessarily they have to pay the gas cost. And the most important here, right, all the things are getting audited by the single auditor.
00:12:54.212 - 00:13:14.752, Speaker A: So what we are proposing, it will be a consensus between the multiple auditors and the company. Like finance can hire, right? More than the one auditor's list, that I can assure. So suppose, take example, Finance is hiring right 50 auditors and there will a consensus between those and they will define a timestamp not in the future.
00:13:14.752 - 00:13:26.420, Speaker A: Because you know right what happened in the last two weeks. Because whenever these guys trying to prove the reserves then what they are just transferring the fronts between these exchanges itself. So that is one of the biggest problem.
00:13:26.420 - 00:13:43.556, Speaker A: So what we are doing, so we are asking these auditors to come up with a epoch time. By consensus between epoch time will be in the past. So after deciding the epoch time, all these auditors will just announce okay, I'm going to audit your reserves.
00:13:43.556 - 00:14:06.140, Speaker A: And so after that results should be able to prepare whatever things needs to be done. So that's way right, all these what we call auditors will be able to prove their reserves and how it will work. So they will take the snapshots of all the valids whatever they are declared by those exchanges.
00:14:06.140 - 00:14:22.020, Speaker A: And apart from that, not only this, this will only reflect how much balance they have. So most important here, like just example, suppose Finance has the five account and there are 50 auditors. So what we are adding most complexity here.
00:14:22.020 - 00:14:46.808, Speaker A: So they can't cheat this system each all the what we call auditors, right, auditors has to give some challenges, challenges to exchange in terms of the non. So in our example, there were the five accounts and 50 auditors. So each exchange has to sign 250 transactions and all those transactions will be validated by these group of auditors.
00:14:46.808 - 00:15:01.388, Speaker A: And once it is done so that's proof that those exchanges are holding the private key of all those valid and they have certain funds. Thus fund is not validated it. So that will be validated by the liabilities.
00:15:01.388 - 00:15:08.848, Speaker A: So that where comes the profile liabilities, right. Unfortunately we cannot go through these specific steps. Our repository is of course public.
00:15:08.848 - 00:15:19.432, Speaker A: Feel free to hit us up on any of the social media platforms and we can go over it better. So I'm going to quickly switch to the other part of it which is proof of liabilities. Can the screens be switched? All right.
00:15:19.432 - 00:15:42.284, Speaker A: While that's happening, essentially how the proof of liabilities will be done is ultimately the snapshot of the database where the user liabilities is maintained is with the centralized exchange. So one of the ways this is done is one of the ways this is done is essentially by generating a merkel tree. Now even with this merkel tree approach, there are certain drawbacks which is a particular exchange could add a leaf node with a negative value.
00:15:42.284 - 00:15:59.830, Speaker A: What this means is while the root sum should have about one hundred K dollars, you could add a minus ten k dollars and essentially the root sum will end up with ninety k dollars. That's not what you want. So to prevent that, we've added a few layers to that and I will go over it as soon as we have the screen live.
00:15:59.830 - 00:16:18.134, Speaker A: Here idea is very simple. User is the perfect guy who will validate the proof of liabilities and nothing but how the things will all the whatever the mercury, right? The exchange is generating. So that will consist in the leaf notes.
00:16:18.134 - 00:16:25.694, Speaker A: That will consist two things. One is the hash has of what has of the username. I'm saying there is no privacy because it will hashed with some salt value.
00:16:25.694 - 00:16:43.358, Speaker A: And the most important security thing is here. This has value, right? And salt will be transferred to the users and using that they can prove the liabilities. And once if the reserve, whatever defined during the auditors is greater than equal to liabilities, so it will prove the solvency.
00:16:43.358 - 00:17:03.958, Speaker A: If something has happened or something is wrong in whole process, then whole things will be insolvent. Okay, just as a side note and disclaimer we are just hackers and builders, not the perfect presenters. Disclaimer just excuse us for the few glitches, technical glitches that we've had today, but we have a fully functional protocol.
00:17:03.958 - 00:17:21.978, Speaker A: You could maybe come and meet us later on or pull from and due to time constraint we have right to wind up very quickly. So we will hear right and you could come to us. I will give you a proper demo, I will explain all the functionality, all the technical aspects, everything.
00:17:21.978 - 00:17:29.550, Speaker A: And I will answer all your questions because I know that this is the topic. You already have the 20 questions already that I can assume.
00:17:29.710 - 00:17:30.580, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:17:33.190 - 00:17:34.100, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:17:34.950 - 00:17:50.310, Speaker B: Congratulations. I need my mic to be always on, please. Well, this is a very apt topic because we have seen a lot of things go wrong recently and now we get an implementation that also came from a recent research from Vitalik.
00:17:50.310 - 00:18:03.470, Speaker B: If I recall, this is the implementation of this. All right, next up is our third demo and that is project Block Alerts. Please welcome Block Alerts on stage pending some technical difficulties.
00:18:03.470 - 00:18:07.486, Speaker B: There we go.
00:18:07.668 - 00:18:23.150, Speaker A: Hello guys. So today we are going to show you demo of Block Alerts. So Block Alerts provide you a platform here where you can set up alerts on your smart contract functions, whether it is transaction or events.
00:18:23.150 - 00:18:41.660, Speaker A: So let's get started with the demo. So here I will try to create alert and I will enter an alert name. Here I need to enter a smart contract address.
00:18:45.390 - 00:18:46.140, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:53.170 - 00:19:23.434, Speaker A: And now I will enter the Slack webhook. So once my alert is created, so what I'm going to do is I am going to execute a transaction of ERC 20 token transfer via this remix. So address is already set, the amount is already set.
00:19:23.434 - 00:19:32.360, Speaker A: So I will just click on the transact. Just give me a minute. Sorry.
00:19:32.360 - 00:20:14.676, Speaker A: I will just click on transact and once I click on transact, then I will wait on slack to reflect, to get the transaction reflected. So let's wait for some time. Yeah.
00:20:14.676 - 00:20:25.210, Speaker A: So the transaction came and twelve my token, one tokens are being transferred from this address to this address. So this is what we have to show you. Thank you, guys.
00:20:25.740 - 00:20:32.744, Speaker B: Thank you. All right, next up we have Team Bold. Please give them a big round of applause.
00:20:32.872 - 00:20:40.744, Speaker A: Good evening, everyone. So how's all the energy here? This is madhukar. That's dhanush and tejasini.
00:20:40.744 - 00:21:00.870, Speaker A: And we are presenting you bowled. Bowel is a strategic team management game where you join and you are the owner of a D 20 cricket team. And when you join as the owner, you get access to a franchise with a set of 15 players and a club and fitness training facilities and all of that.
00:21:00.870 - 00:21:20.628, Speaker A: So as a manager and owner of a team, what do you actually do? You train players after every game. You find that one player is not doing so well, or one player does exceptionally well. Maybe you give them a hike or you train them in a specific skills, you send them back to academy and you mainly set the match lineup.
00:21:20.628 - 00:21:30.780, Speaker A: This player goes to bat first, this player goes to bat second, and this bowler goes to bat first and second, and so on. So without further ado, let's jump right into the demo. So here we have our website, Bowl GG.
00:21:30.780 - 00:21:42.240, Speaker A: Let's get started. We have a wonderful sign up supported by Biconomy. And welcome to Bauer.
00:21:42.240 - 00:21:54.980, Speaker A: Let's give our team a name. And you're all set up. As you can see on the screen, you're seeing individual player NFTs, which are cricket players.
00:21:54.980 - 00:22:13.976, Speaker A: You can see right hand batsmen, left hand batsmen, and different form fitness. And each of these things, each of the player has specific set of skills which are unique to them in terms of fielding, wicketkeeping, batting versus seam, batting versus spin, bowling main and bowling variation. And where does this all go into? Right, let's talk about the match.
00:22:13.976 - 00:22:23.208, Speaker A: As you can see right now, there's a match going on between your own team and bot army, which is yet to bat. As you can see. That's very sad.
00:22:23.208 - 00:22:30.508, Speaker A: We just got all out in 12.6 hours. So we have built a match engine which simulates the match ball by ball basis.
00:22:30.508 - 00:22:47.792, Speaker A: So for every ball there's a batsman and a bowler. And there are certain attributes that they have in terms of spin, in terms of batting and bowling fitness, form, age and even pitch. So based on the specific attributes of the specific players, it will run a probability distribution and it will generate an outcome.
00:22:47.792 - 00:22:54.644, Speaker A: So that's what we have built here. As you can see, the game is running live. Let's jump back into here.
00:22:54.644 - 00:23:01.156, Speaker A: So what else can you do in the game. As a manager, you can also buy and sell players. You can scout for new talents.
00:23:01.156 - 00:23:19.336, Speaker A: If you find that your players are not good enough, you are placed in a league with ten other teams and you're going to be playing against them for ten offset matches. And your goal is to win the games. So you'll be placed in one of the leagues and as season ends, you go up in leagues and you become the champion.
00:23:19.336 - 00:23:41.220, Speaker A: So let me also just talk about why we are using web three here, right? So especially when we build a game like this, which is based on probability, probability distributions and probability, which is so random, which can give you random outputs. If you put this on a centralized server, or if you put this on an algorithm which people cannot see or people cannot trust you, then they are not going to play it right. People play games for fun.
00:23:41.220 - 00:23:50.036, Speaker A: Whether they put their money in it or not, it doesn't matter. They play for fun. And if they become sad that and if they don't trust the game engine, they're not going to play the game anymore.
00:23:50.036 - 00:24:06.220, Speaker A: So other than transparency itself, we are also using the out of the box capabilities of NFTs, where you can sell them, trade them, or you can do access control and all these sorts of things. I think that's our time. Get ready to be bald.
00:24:11.780 - 00:24:18.856, Speaker B: Amazing. This is pretty cool and just a really fun game. All right, next up is Team Dpay.
00:24:18.856 - 00:24:20.740, Speaker B: Please give them a big round of applause.
00:24:28.780 - 00:24:29.530, Speaker A: Hi.
00:24:30.300 - 00:24:31.050, Speaker B: Hi.
00:24:31.900 - 00:24:52.112, Speaker A: All right, everybody looks so okay, so our team name is Giant, and the name of our project is Deepay. Deepay stands for decentralized payment to send and receive crypto, basically connecting the accounts using the phone numbers. So any receiver and any sender can actually claim and create their phone number as an identity using polygon ID app.
00:24:52.112 - 00:25:05.860, Speaker A: So we'll straightaway jump into the demo. So we'll register a new number and we'll do it live. So we first connect the MetaMask wallet, which is basically an account address that mapping will be creating and storing as a unique Identifier.
00:25:05.860 - 00:25:44.356, Speaker A: All right, now can you just go ahead and send the money to any specific phone number that you have? All right, so basically the whole idea is that this DPN becomes like a passport. So in a passport you have visas for various different countries. So similarly, this particular phone number can have multiple account addresses linked across multiple chains.
00:25:44.356 - 00:25:59.068, Speaker A: So the resolver actually basically the receiver receiver phone number would be added over here. So when the sender is actually sending the money, he doesn't need to remember about the account address anymore. You can actually link it directly to any specific phone number you put in the phone number you send the money.
00:25:59.068 - 00:26:08.640, Speaker A: Voila. Crypto transferred. And we have integrated various different APIs using covalent and also the push protocol.
00:26:08.640 - 00:26:59.730, Speaker A: Yes, so due to some technical glitch, we'll just create and connect the wallet again and just send. I know it is on testnet, but we'll still reserve our funds. So we'll try to transfer probably 0.2,
00:26:59.730 - 00:27:02.812, Speaker A: like the currency that is going to be the matic token.
00:27:02.956 - 00:27:04.610, Speaker B: And send.
00:27:33.370 - 00:27:44.994, Speaker A: You can just put in my number if you want. Plus nine, 1703-290-7039. Yeah.
00:27:44.994 - 00:28:57.460, Speaker A: 703290, double two, one, six. Right. All what? The claim and resolving has been done using Polygon ID number.
00:28:57.460 - 00:29:38.594, Speaker A: Can you just send now make the account. You can register any new phone number if you want. Can you quickly do that? Yeah.
00:29:38.594 - 00:30:04.964, Speaker A: So we would try to resolve and claim the identity using Polygon ID app. Over here we'll receive an OTP from Trilio. Now, once the issuer has actually issued the QR code, we'll scan this QR code onto the Polygon ID app.
00:30:04.964 - 00:30:24.650, Speaker A: Now, once this number is claimed, congratulations, your phone number is registered along with the MetaMask wallet address that was already registered with it. Continue. Now, you can just send from this DPN to any other number.
00:30:24.650 - 00:30:58.130, Speaker A: Why don't you try my number again? 703290, double two, one, six and zero. Just select that net. A has less mode.
00:30:58.130 - 00:31:05.160, Speaker A: Okay, let's actually try to finish the demo once.
00:31:06.810 - 00:31:07.640, Speaker B: All right.
00:31:09.930 - 00:31:18.460, Speaker A: So all of this is actually the notifications, which will be coming from Push Protocol. We can actually see them on the dashboard too. And all the notifications are on the right over here.
00:31:18.460 - 00:31:22.246, Speaker A: That's team repay.
00:31:22.358 - 00:31:35.482, Speaker B: Thank you. I know live demos are not always perfect, but we got a really good demo still. And please give them a big round of applause.
00:31:35.482 - 00:31:46.100, Speaker B: All right, next up we have our 6th finalist. Please welcome Persona Bot Wallet Detection. This is a cool one.
00:31:47.510 - 00:31:58.226, Speaker D: Hi, guys. We are from Team Persona. We all know that bots is a real problem in web three, most DApps are broken or abandoned because of lack of real users.
00:31:58.226 - 00:32:15.634, Speaker D: And there are these AirDrop campaigns which are immediately claimed by these AirDrop hunters and bots, taking away the true value of all these new user acquisition campaigns run by the DApps. So we wanted to solve that. We built a bot detection model to help DApps engage with real users.
00:32:15.634 - 00:32:25.520, Speaker D: So how did we do that? The main problem is that bot labels don't exist. So based on our literature review.
00:32:28.210 - 00:32:28.574, Speaker A: We.
00:32:28.612 - 00:32:35.966, Speaker D: Created a time series anomaly detector. By that what I mean is that think about it. Humans.
00:32:35.966 - 00:32:53.026, Speaker D: The average time between sent transactions of humans is never whole numbers. But in the case of bots, they repeat transactions at regular intervals, say like 1 minute or one day. For the purpose of this hackathon, we chose the active users of OpenSea in the month of November.
00:32:53.026 - 00:33:10.426, Speaker D: This is the frequency plot. And from this, we generated our bot labels. Now that we have our bot labels, we engineered more features such as average send value, average time for send transactions, maximum value sent, and such features.
00:33:10.426 - 00:33:26.962, Speaker D: And after performing normalization of the features, we ran Kmeans clustering to get a visual representation of the bots versus non bots. Here you can see that the blue dots are the non bots and the orange are the bots. You can see that clearly in the center.
00:33:26.962 - 00:33:37.794, Speaker D: The bots are clustered based on these features. To get a better visualization, we downsample the non bot accounts. Here you can see the clear separation.
00:33:37.794 - 00:33:52.390, Speaker D: So if you choose the right features, you can clearly identify the bots. Now that we have the labels and the features, we wanted to perform supervised learning. We ran a random forest classifier and we got like a good score.
00:33:52.390 - 00:34:09.658, Speaker D: But how do we test the hypothesis? How do we predict an accuracy score? So this is where we apply transfer learning. By that what I mean is that we trained the model in numbers data set and predicted on October's data set. And then we also generated the labels to get an accuracy metric.
00:34:09.658 - 00:34:22.082, Speaker D: I know all this might sound like Greek and Latin to a lot of people, but basically we got a good accuracy score. We have a bot detection accuracy for 0.7 and accuracy for non bot addiction as zero eight.
00:34:22.082 - 00:34:30.630, Speaker D: So this is just a proof of work. Proof of work concept for bot prediction. We know that bots can also change their behavior.
00:34:30.630 - 00:34:41.580, Speaker D: At the same time, even we can come up with new features to understand their behavior and weed out bots to build more sustainable DApps. Weeding out bots is the way to go. Thank you.
00:34:45.710 - 00:34:55.550, Speaker B: Amazing. Well, on the internet, nobody knows you're a bot and it's even more true on blockchains. All right, next up is our 7th demo of the day.
00:34:55.550 - 00:35:02.540, Speaker B: Please welcome Sadev CI. There you go.
00:35:05.570 - 00:35:11.678, Speaker C: Hi everyone. So we start yeah. Hi everyone.
00:35:11.678 - 00:35:24.100, Speaker C: My name is Tushar Oja and we are building Sadesh CI. So let me start with a quick story here. So you can see on the screen that how many of you have used GitHub today like everyone does.
00:35:24.100 - 00:35:36.422, Speaker C: Because even the DAOs, the decentralized organizations are also using GitHub to store their content. So GitHub has become the source of truth for all the projects which we have today. But it is not right.
00:35:36.422 - 00:35:56.878, Speaker C: In the past we have seen projects like Truncate Cache and tons of others which can be taken down because of the so much power GitHub had. Today they can take down the projects and even after GitHub taken down their projects when they were live again, they are still using GitHub today. How stupid is that that you can use the GitHub, the platform which revoked you.
00:35:56.878 - 00:36:16.978, Speaker C: So there are solutions like Githopia to it which are decentralized GitHub, but no one is using it. So why are we not using githopia? Because Githopia is having or the similar projects are having one of the worst user experience because it is not onboarded till the experience the seamless things and. The comfort which GitHub provides us.
00:36:16.978 - 00:36:23.570, Speaker C: So there's definitely a problem here that we can address. So here becomes sadev CI. So sadev.
00:36:23.570 - 00:36:39.942, Speaker C: It's a Sanskrit and Hindi word which means forever. So what we are trying to build is basically we are backing up your GitHub repositories onto the python and the web three infrastructure. So how does that work is basically I'll quickly show you up in the image you can see that your GitHub repository with just two steps.
00:36:39.942 - 00:36:59.970, Speaker C: You can basically run a CI CD implementation onto like you can set up a workflow and it will automatically going to backup with every new commit onto the filecon blockchain. It is going to index it onto the filecon network and then going to index on the polygon blockchain. Additionally it is also using subgraph to give you fastest queries of these things.
00:36:59.970 - 00:37:12.854, Speaker C: So like everything what you want. So the thing which you are seeing on this place is basically live from the subgraph index about different things. Like you can click on here to see the IPFS and every single thing on the polygon chain transaction as well.
00:37:12.854 - 00:37:34.800, Speaker C: So how do you set up? Let's quickly see the setup process here. If this WiFi works network so you can see this is deployed on the zip file is on there and I'm going to use the taking time to load people. But there's simple way you can.
00:37:38.900 - 00:37:39.216, Speaker A: Let.
00:37:39.238 - 00:37:47.934, Speaker C: Me disconnect from the WiFi. Actually it is the wi Fi causing the issue. 1 second.
00:37:47.934 - 00:37:51.838, Speaker C: Give me a second. Yeah. Cool.
00:37:51.838 - 00:37:53.300, Speaker C: Now it should work.
00:37:55.110 - 00:37:55.474, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:55.512 - 00:38:05.390, Speaker C: Here you can see these are just two steps. What you have to do first you have to open a GitHub repository. Let's say this repository which I created five years ago, which is not even a web three project, it's a web two project.
00:38:05.390 - 00:38:16.126, Speaker C: You can still back it up. What you have to do is basically go to the settings of this GitHub repository, go to the secrets and click on actions here. What you have to do, you have to create a new repository secret.
00:38:16.126 - 00:38:39.234, Speaker C: So it's a public good project where you can use just simple web three storage and copy the access token there and paste it here and go back here, copy this, paste it here and one step is already done. Now just the second step which is even simpler than this. What you have to do, click on the GitHub actions and you have to basically set up a workflow and workflow setup is also very simple.
00:38:39.234 - 00:38:44.194, Speaker C: You just have to copy this thing, go back here, paste it, check this thing.
00:38:44.232 - 00:38:44.994, Speaker A: It's good.
00:38:45.112 - 00:38:53.320, Speaker C: Just make a commit about it like workflow let's say. And then done. Now you are already done.
00:38:53.320 - 00:39:14.410, Speaker C: If you go to the GitHub actions your project GitHub action is already up and running and it's going to take your project to the decentralized infrastructure. So the source of truth is transferred to the decentralized infrastructure and I request all of you people to use this project and do the similar thing right in the sakathan. It's live and you can do it on the Polygon Mumbai testnet.
00:39:14.410 - 00:39:29.858, Speaker C: Now let's moving up, taking one more second. So GitHub and Githopia are actually like that's why our team is called it us iskitopia use CASER once that on another. So we are using both of these and figuring out our path in this.
00:39:29.858 - 00:39:33.218, Speaker C: So yeah, let's see what could happen.
00:39:33.304 - 00:40:10.970, Speaker D: All right Vishal, so let's discuss what if this hackathon was of 48 hours? So what could have been? So the first thing that we could have done was on chain identity and reputation for developers basically by using Lens profile and linking it with web three social auth GitHub. So the next is two factor authentication for releases. So the release manager based on the smart contract will receive a notification using push protocol and will be able to approve the release and then it can also be used to send the release notification to their respective open source communities.
00:40:12.050 - 00:40:18.382, Speaker C: So yeah, that's it. Thank you everyone for listening. The project is live, just try to use it and let me know your feedback on this.
00:40:18.436 - 00:40:23.758, Speaker B: Thanks. This is so cool. Hopefully we all get to use it for the next hackathons.
00:40:23.758 - 00:40:30.210, Speaker B: All right, next up we have team Chainpay. Please welcome Team Chainpay on stage.
00:40:38.320 - 00:40:54.640, Speaker E: So hey everyone, we are team Chain Pay and I would be telling you what we are really about. So giving you an overview, quick overview. There are about 100 million crypto users and barely 1% of the user actually transfers and uses crypto in their daily life transactions.
00:40:54.640 - 00:41:09.728, Speaker E: So what is chain pay? It is basically a self custodial wallet which lets you transfer crypto payments in a UPI manner. The problems that we have faced. So if any one of you have used finance, you might have used peer to peer transaction.
00:41:09.728 - 00:41:28.796, Speaker E: That is you give someone money and you know that it's really timeful and you need 20 to 30 minutes for that to progress. So giving you some numbers, there are 7% of the world population that uses crypto. 1% barely uses it for normal transactions and 20 minutes is the average time that one takes for P to P.
00:41:28.796 - 00:41:42.816, Speaker E: The solution that we are giving, we are removing P to P, we are directly giving cryptocurrency into INR. One benefit is you can actually buy tea from this app. You can literally use any QR code scanner and you can buy from it.
00:41:42.816 - 00:41:52.604, Speaker E: The second benefit is we are actually liquidating crypto. That is the biggest part of it. Crypto is no longer looked as an asset and it is more sort of a liquid currency that one can use like a fiat currency.
00:41:52.604 - 00:42:09.880, Speaker E: And the third thing on a long term perspective is we are actually encouraging businesses to accept crypto as well so that the more liquidity aspect comes into play. Now, why should I be using chain Pay. It's basically because over a period of time when the ecosystem becomes it has zero gas fee if you're accepting it in crypto.
00:42:09.880 - 00:42:17.950, Speaker E: So this is our target market. We are planning on expanding it in a few months. But now I would like to give an app demo of our app.
00:42:17.950 - 00:42:48.250, Speaker E: So this is our app I would like to go we would be using web three authentication because most of the people that we are targeting don't even know what MetaMask is. So we are using social login where people can easily log in with the Google accounts and they have an address generated towards it. So I would be showing that and by the way, it's built in react native so it has support for both iOS as well as Android.
00:42:48.250 - 00:43:11.870, Speaker E: Both of them can use it. I would be choosing one of the Google IDs and I would like to nominate anyone from the crowd who can come and show me the QR code for a UPI and I would like to perform a live transaction to them. Is anyone willing to do so? Yeah, please.
00:43:11.870 - 00:43:45.128, Speaker E: Yeah. So we are supporting few chains right now, one of them being Ethereum polygon or we would be playing this presentation on Fuse mainnet and the internet is giving some issues. Just a minute.
00:43:45.128 - 00:43:51.040, Speaker E: Yeah so you can see the wallet right now it's 4.22 fuse. Right now it is the native currency.
00:43:51.040 - 00:43:53.300, Speaker E: I would be performing a transaction.
00:43:57.560 - 00:43:58.310, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:44:06.100 - 00:44:25.492, Speaker E: Yeah, we're giving him his back, his phone and the back end is running on Stackos. That was a partner in this Ethereum hackathon and we are also implemented push for basically notifying any user that your transaction has successfully completed. So give it a few time and the payment has been done from our end.
00:44:25.492 - 00:44:33.810, Speaker E: He would be receiving it soon. The wallet difference is there so now.
00:44:35.380 - 00:44:38.130, Speaker A: And yeah.
00:44:39.860 - 00:44:49.270, Speaker E: And it's really quick. You don't need to wait for 20 minutes, you can just have it. So we'll show you the push messaging one.
00:44:49.270 - 00:45:08.294, Speaker E: So this is the push network where you get notified that your transaction has went through. Everything about the app is completely decentralized and that has nothing central to us. So this is from our side.
00:45:08.294 - 00:45:16.860, Speaker E: It is super fast and we are planning on it being the next revolution in terms of payments where everything is going on crypto smoothly across the world. So thank you.
00:45:22.290 - 00:45:33.630, Speaker B: Wow, that was absolutely incredible. And this gets to be a real life application for all of us. All right, welcome team Ethguard as our 9th finalist for the weekend.
00:45:33.630 - 00:45:35.730, Speaker B: Give them a big round of applause.
00:45:37.830 - 00:45:50.870, Speaker A: Hello everyone. I'm Himanshu and these are my colleagues Stanley and Ajinkya. We all work at this startup called Verize where we do auditing and develop formal method tools for auditing.
00:45:50.870 - 00:46:11.020, Speaker A: And here we are presenting a tool called Ethgard which is a responsive MLB based smart contract vulnerability detection for Vs code. So just to lay the background for this. Why do we need this tool? We see hacks everywhere in DFI in specific.
00:46:11.020 - 00:46:21.114, Speaker A: So DFI is where we have so much money logged in. Just last year there were $2.1 billion lost due to such hacks.
00:46:21.114 - 00:46:47.560, Speaker A: And these hacks are a lot of the times preventable and for that it's recommended to go for audits. But audits have their limitations as well. Audits takes time and tools are trying to bring that to speed, but it's still a slow process usually and people want to get on chain as quickly as possible due to all the competition that's there in the market.
00:46:47.560 - 00:47:08.574, Speaker A: So the idea that we have is we should try to find bugs as much as possible during development itself. And that's why what we build here is a Vs code extension to detect smart contract bugs. So we all are developing our smart contracts in Vs code usually or maybe something else.
00:47:08.574 - 00:47:39.206, Speaker A: But yeah, Vs code is also nice. So we have developed the plugin for Vs code right now and what we do here is during the development phase itself you can find these vulnerabilities that we find using Aceguard, using machine learning. Like we have trained our models and those models are producing an output telling you if this vulnerability might be there in your code.
00:47:39.206 - 00:48:05.178, Speaker A: And the vulnerabilities that we detect are reentrancy access control bugs, front running attacks, unchecked low level calls. So this is what we did in this hackathon, but the list can go on as we get more data and as we get more time. And why do we use machine learning technique in specific is because we could have used some static analyzer as well at the back end or a fuzzer.
00:48:05.178 - 00:48:44.492, Speaker A: But usually what happens is these tools take a lot of time to run to produce outputs to tell you if the vulnerability exists and that's why we are using machine learning here. Now I would ask Ajinkya to present a demo for the tool. What we have here is basically a Vs code plugin that you just install in your system and in current form.
00:48:44.492 - 00:49:15.990, Speaker A: Whenever you have a save action for the Vs code plugin, it fires up the machine learning model and if it finds any bug, it reports those bugs back to the user. So we just begin the Vs code plugin, we get a new Vs code window which has the new extension installed. And here we have already chosen three buggy programs and I would just initiate a save action on those.
00:49:15.990 - 00:49:54.630, Speaker A: So I request your attention at the bottom right of the screen where it says analyzing code, review code upon save and it starts running the machine learning model. Sometime we get back the results and whether they are vulnerable or not. One of the future ideas that we are planning to do with this is try to get the attention numbers from machine learning model to locate the line and the data path on the model in the code that causes the reinterrency or the bug to be triggered.
00:49:54.630 - 00:51:19.290, Speaker A: Okay, so the model has been fired and we're waiting for results. I am not sure if something let me try that again. Hey, something seems to be broken.
00:51:19.290 - 00:51:41.280, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess that's my time. Thank you.
00:51:48.770 - 00:51:56.894, Speaker B: I personally get always excited about a lot of DevTools. And this was a pretty meta demo. We were debugging the debugging tool, but we got to see it nevertheless.
00:51:56.894 - 00:52:02.450, Speaker B: All right, three more demos to go. So please welcome finalist number ten, chartswap.
00:52:21.240 - 00:52:27.028, Speaker A: You. Hello, everyone. I hope you're doing very well.
00:52:27.028 - 00:52:38.360, Speaker A: Let's get started on the problem statement. At first. So by the NITI ayog of India, the government of India aims to achieve 30% of vehicles on road, should be electric by 2030.
00:52:38.360 - 00:52:52.780, Speaker A: Now, there's a significant challenge to this, especially in a country like India. Regarding the infrastructure of charging stations, another problem is the low range and the problem with batteries. So there's the first conventional ways to use charging stations.
00:52:52.780 - 00:53:25.160, Speaker A: Another proposed solution is to have stations where you can swap your discharge battery with charged batteries on the station. But there's again, problems with this solution. Number one, how do you keep a price on the usage of the battery? Number two, how do you attribute the source of the battery which it was made from? Why? You can call an ecosystem truly renewable only if the source the battery was made from is also renewable, right? So here's what we present presenting chartswap.
00:53:25.160 - 00:53:41.368, Speaker A: We aim to put every charging station onto the blockchain with the help of an IoT enabled device. So the idea is that every station will be on the chain. What it helps us with is that, number one, the data is going to be immutable.
00:53:41.368 - 00:53:59.884, Speaker A: And number two, you can easily attribute where the source came from. And number three, things like how the battery was used, who used it, et cetera, how the health is will not like. You can attribute all of that and no one can actually affect the prices of the usage.
00:53:59.884 - 00:54:07.732, Speaker A: So we'll quickly get in the demo. Right now, let's quickly get started and log into the application. We'll use MetaMask right now.
00:54:07.732 - 00:54:19.848, Speaker A: We've used economy to integrate that. So this is the dashboard which the user gets. After the dashboard, the user gets access to seeing the stations, the nearby stations that he can go to.
00:54:19.848 - 00:54:30.444, Speaker A: So if you quickly go to the stations, you quickly see stations that are nearby. And then you can search for stations that you would like to go to. It also indicates how far it is and if batteries are available or not.
00:54:30.444 - 00:54:41.584, Speaker A: Then when you reach the station, here's where the fun part comes out. You see how much you have to pay, because we already know which battery is owned by the user. Asim you can take over.
00:54:41.702 - 00:54:42.370, Speaker B: Okay.
00:54:44.980 - 00:54:53.276, Speaker A: I'm not sure if you guys can see, but I have quite a bit of electrons in my hand. Okay, so there's actually a display over here. It shows you the details about the IoT.
00:54:53.276 - 00:55:13.000, Speaker A: First thing I do is I take an RFID key, I scan it on the RFID scanner. It shows like yeah, currently on the screen, it says, loading it's fetching data from the smart contract. In a few seconds, we can see all of the details of the smart contracts are seen, such as the battery ID, who owns the user, and if it's in use.
00:55:13.000 - 00:55:30.560, Speaker A: So with the help of all of this, when the user scans this information, check is run. A check is sent to the smart contract saying, user is present at the station. Let him transact with the station and let him get new batteries.
00:55:30.560 - 00:55:45.364, Speaker A: So we click on the Pay Now button. Yes. And then we click on the click on Confirm.
00:55:45.364 - 00:56:07.330, Speaker A: So this transaction has been sent to the blockchain. In a few seconds, the block will be verified. So once again, when I take the ID and then tap it on, you will see that the RFID is now de allocated and a new ID, and the user will now have a new ID.
00:56:07.330 - 00:56:26.012, Speaker A: I know you're not able to see it clearly, but yes, so that's about it. We also have, like, notification support using push protocol. So whenever a new station is added, they can subscribe to that channel and they can also see where the stations are added.
00:56:26.012 - 00:56:33.530, Speaker A: So we also use IPFS for storing the metadata of the battery, and we have deployed the contract on polygon. Thank you so much.
00:56:41.690 - 00:56:50.070, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, two more demos to go. Next up, and our second last finalist of the day, Team Safeguard.
00:56:50.070 - 00:56:52.570, Speaker B: Please welcome Team Safeguard on stage.
00:57:01.650 - 00:57:12.626, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. We are Team Safeguard, and we build customizable on chain financial controllers for your nosis safes. So we have less time and a lot of transactions to go through.
00:57:12.626 - 00:57:34.420, Speaker A: So I'll explain you on the way what we are doing. So we have a safe over here, and I'll copy the safe address, and we want to install an allow list guard on it. And we have a list of whitelist addresses that we want to use and continue.
00:57:34.420 - 00:57:52.402, Speaker A: So what are transaction guards? Transaction guards are like a final check before the execution of a safe transaction. And if the guard rewards the safe, execution rewards as well. So these final checks help you improve the account security of your safe.
00:57:52.402 - 00:58:09.390, Speaker A: So what's happening right now is I'm using an Allow list guard. An Allow list guard allows you to whitelist certain addresses so that the transactions can only be sent to those addresses. This is very beneficial for cases like a grant Dow where they want the transactions to be only sent to the grantees and nobody else accidentally.
00:58:09.390 - 00:58:37.010, Speaker A: So what has happened now is that the guard address has been deployed onto the blockchain, and I'm now signing a message so that I can set up the guard on my safe. So, this safe has three people and at least two signers are necessary to do any transaction. I see that the safe has been created and I received and there is a queue and this said guard requires a confirmation.
00:58:37.010 - 00:58:52.150, Speaker A: I cannot confirm because I was the one who proposed the transaction. So I'll change my account and now I can confirm the transaction.
00:58:59.600 - 00:59:00.236, Speaker B: And I.
00:59:00.258 - 00:59:15.290, Speaker A: Have submitted the transaction. I'll need to confirm the execution. My wallet, here it is and confirmed.
00:59:15.290 - 00:59:30.138, Speaker A: So now what has happened is I have deployed a guard address. The guard is the allow list guard and I have set it up on my safe. Now, if you do it the normal way, you would need to know how to code the custom logic of the smart contract, deploy it and then set it up yourself.
00:59:30.138 - 00:59:43.186, Speaker A: But we have made it into a seamless manner so that you can do it in just with one click. And all the signers just have to do their signs and it's indexing over here, so it's already accepted by the blockchain. Okay, so it's history.
00:59:43.186 - 00:59:57.640, Speaker A: So now we have already set the guard. If we can go to the settings, we see that in the modules page, we have now installed a transaction guard. So using this transaction guard, let us try to send a transaction to this address which I had not whitelisted before.
00:59:57.640 - 01:00:28.800, Speaker A: I'll use the Gold ETH and let's say I want to send 0.1 and submit, I sign the message on my end and it seems to go through. Now, you might wonder why even though this address was not whitelisted, I was still able to submit this transaction.
01:00:28.800 - 01:00:58.584, Speaker A: This is because the guard only kicks off when the last person needs to execute the transaction and only one sign has been done. As of now, I change my account address back to the first one who is the other signer and check the queue and over it is. If I try to confirm now it says that the transaction is most likely to fail.
01:00:58.584 - 01:01:10.880, Speaker A: If we try to simulate it on tenderly, it says that the transaction failed because I'm not sending the transaction to an allowed address. That means the guard worked exactly like it had to. And even if I try to submit, the transaction will just reward.
01:01:10.880 - 01:01:27.588, Speaker A: We have a lot of other guards, like a denialist guard which allows you to blacklist certain addresses. A gas volatility guard that helps you not to overpay during transactions because until all the signers side, the gas price must shoot up. But with this guard you'll never overpay for your transactions.
01:01:27.588 - 01:01:42.990, Speaker A: And a timeline guard where you can set a validity period for a safe and after the validity period ends, the person who has been allotted the safe will not be able to use it anymore. These are just the simple guards that we have started now and we have plans to launch much many more. Thank you.
01:01:48.820 - 01:02:04.180, Speaker B: All right, are you all ready for our final demo of the weekend? No? Are you all excited for the last demo of the weekend? There we go. Please welcome Trickle.
01:02:06.440 - 01:02:35.820, Speaker A: Hi everyone, my name is Roshan Sharma and I have my co founder Shalu with me. How many of Devs haven't slept tonight? Nice. So it's very difficult to engage you guys but what if I said that hey, I have $200,000 which I am throwing a party tonight and whoever wants to come for 1 hour how many of you would for that hypothetical situation would come to that party? Nice.
01:02:35.820 - 01:03:27.212, Speaker A: A couple of them, others are not interested in money but one of the core problems as content creators so we both are content creators and one of the core problems which we face is low engagement. So we built a mobile first platform that rewards you for engagement content creators can build communities, they can create chat rooms, they can create exclusive communities as well, they can get tips, all those kind of things and now whenever the user interacts with their content they get rewarded, the users get rewarded. The trick over here is we are unlike any dash to earn kind of games or kind of any platform we are sustainable engage and earn platform which works on a giveaway model now Shalu is showing you how the platform works.
01:03:27.212 - 01:03:56.284, Speaker A: We are mobile first so bear with us with a small screen now you can tip the content creator unless the transaction goes through so you have to speed it up but just go to the second tab. Yeah. So we have created a tinder like or Inshots like interface where you can swipe left and right, check different articles, check different posts, so that you are always engaged.
01:03:56.284 - 01:04:07.852, Speaker A: Your audience is always engaged. Your profile is looking quite good on the right hand side of the screen. And now you can see all the people who have participated on your profile.
01:04:07.852 - 01:04:17.792, Speaker A: You can see the active pool. And how this works is how this reward works is there are three ways. One, as a content creator, you can fund your own reward pool.
01:04:17.792 - 01:04:29.480, Speaker A: A couple of folks will join. Second, if you are Sandeepan and people follow you, you can join their exclusive community, pay for them to join. A portion of that goes back to the community.
01:04:29.480 - 01:04:41.432, Speaker A: And third, you can get a sponsor, let's say Defolio. And I am a good creator and Defolio wants to sponsor my content. They want me to talk about their content so they can fund my reward pool.
01:04:41.432 - 01:05:06.148, Speaker A: A portion will go to me and the rest of this will go to the end user as well, who is Devfolio's most genuine user as well. So you are not only paying the influencer, you are also paying the end user. Now all these are the different transactions which are happening on the platform so we have built this platform in two days, so bear with us in terms of how it looks.
01:05:06.148 - 01:05:32.428, Speaker A: So all these profiles, all the content pieces which you upload goes to the IPFS or decentralized storage networks. We have deployed on Polygon, Ethereum and Shardium in this time, and since we do not require any native token to work, we are platform agnostic. We can work with any platform, any blockchain, and we will be integrating more.
01:05:32.428 - 01:05:42.160, Speaker A: We are also integrating with Lens Protocol. So this is the portfolio. And just show this leaderboard.
01:05:42.160 - 01:05:52.036, Speaker A: So every time people engage on the platform, they are added to the part of leaderboard and whoever performs the most.
01:05:52.138 - 01:05:54.096, Speaker B: Highest, they get rewarded.
01:05:54.208 - 01:06:09.208, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's our platform. Also, if you want to check it out, you can tag us on Devfolio's Discord or ETH India's Discord.
01:06:09.304 - 01:06:20.930, Speaker B: Thank you. Amazing. All right, now you're going to have to wait for me to connect my laptop and we hope no technical difficulties come upon this one.
01:06:20.930 - 01:06:50.100, Speaker B: All right, well, I want to thank all twelve of our amazing finalists for coming on stage and demoing twelve incredible projects. We're going to talk about all the prizes soon, but for the next ten minutes, I want to give the stage to Denver, who is the CEO at that Folio. You've seen him running around making sure everything is on track and he's probably way more tired than all of you combined, but they have a lot of amazing things to want to talk about, so please give Denver a big round of applause.
01:07:03.010 - 01:07:05.242, Speaker C: GM. GM. GM.
01:07:05.242 - 01:07:07.250, Speaker C: How's it going, Bangalore?
01:07:09.030 - 01:07:22.520, Speaker A: Can we get a couple of GMs? We managed to squeeze one last demo before we close and I really like my mic on.
01:07:24.570 - 01:07:41.222, Speaker C: Can we do it again? GM. GM. How's it going, Bangalore? Yeah, I could clearly feel the tiredness, but I hope you all have had fun in this hackathon.
01:07:41.222 - 01:07:54.880, Speaker C: Last few days have been hectic tiredness. I know a lot of folks haven't slept. We haven't slept in the last few weeks, but seeing such great projects being built makes up all for it.
01:07:55.890 - 01:07:57.794, Speaker E: Maria, how do you feel?
01:07:57.832 - 01:07:58.530, Speaker C: Denver?
01:08:00.310 - 01:08:11.958, Speaker A: I feel great. All the sleep and nothing matters. It's all worth it to see all the hard work that all of you have put in.
01:08:11.958 - 01:08:43.020, Speaker A: We have had over 450 projects submitted and then it's truly an honor to be able to bring ETH India to you. All right, but this isn't it. We at Defolio believe that Ethereum is the infinite garden, and Ethereum, like ETH India, is really part of a much larger movement than the hackathon that you're attending.
01:08:43.020 - 01:09:06.308, Speaker A: Over the years, we have worked really hard in building a community of ethereum aligned individuals from India and who are building for a decentralized future. And this is where Defolio steps in. Defolio is a community of over 250,000 incredible builders like you leveraging proof of work to get access to opportunities that build for the future.
01:09:06.308 - 01:09:18.250, Speaker A: While today Defolio deploys hackathons, fellowships and grants to support these initiatives. This isn't how it always was. It all began at in out 2015.
01:09:20.060 - 01:09:33.324, Speaker C: Yeah, long time back. I think we both weren't there back then, but these folks really were the stepstones of what Defolio is today. So big kudos to all of them.
01:09:33.324 - 01:10:07.704, Speaker C: Some of them are already here, some of them are not with us, but their memories always stay with us. What began as a hackathon to test out how far we could go, defolio today is a community of incredible builders like you, I think over 250K builders who use our platform to get access to opportunities. And if you think about it, all the actions that someone takes on the platform, be it attending a hackathon, winning a hackathon, getting into a fellowship, getting a grant, becomes your proof of work.
01:10:07.704 - 01:10:31.250, Speaker C: And that's what Defolio is empowering. Defolia is kind of becoming an alternate credentialing platform completely based on your proof of work. We have been building a lot of interesting things in the past few months, few quarters, and we have been really excited to show what we have been building.
01:10:31.250 - 01:11:16.160, Speaker C: Some very interesting things that I have been personally excited about, including implementing quadrating funding as a feature on the platform, which probably, I think one of the coolest things which came out of crypto is coming to Defolio platform. All ethereum hackathons going forward would also have quadratic funding enabled by default. We are building a very interesting feature which we are calling Cheer Project, where the intention is to help builders make more money by helping other builders cheer them.
01:11:16.160 - 01:11:33.648, Speaker C: So for example, if I like Denver's Project, I could cheer him with some ETH and in return I could get some seekers. Right? So all of that becomes my Credential and Den would get some money to sustain himself. Yeah.
01:11:33.648 - 01:11:52.620, Speaker C: And a very interesting thing which we are doing is revamping our new profile, which would probably look something like this, but yeah, these are the lot of interesting things that we have been building over to Denver to share more things about initiatives.
01:11:56.000 - 01:12:10.876, Speaker A: Right. And as we build this proof of work, defolio is also the platform where you get access to build your proof of work. Through all of these initiatives that we have, you get to participate in the best hackathons.
01:12:10.876 - 01:12:20.656, Speaker A: We have a community hackathon program that's massively popular. We have hosted over 500 plus hackathons. We have a defolio official hackathons other than ETH.
01:12:20.656 - 01:12:30.792, Speaker A: India. We have in, out and women. Something that we are really passionate about on Defolio you can also get paid to learn.
01:12:30.792 - 01:12:55.584, Speaker A: We have hosted seven of these fellowships so far and we have an announcement coming up in five minutes or sooner. You can also get equity free grants on Defolio if you're building out of India and you need any money to just support you through your process. After the hackathon ends, you can apply for an equity free.
01:12:55.584 - 01:13:36.556, Speaker A: Grant up to $5,000 through ETH india grants. And yeah, I guess this wasn't five minutes, but this is the announcement and the next ETH India Fellowship is open, applications are open for it. And we are really glad to be able to get builders give builders the opportunity to take off the worry about where do they get internships and stuff like that, and just give them the opportunity to purely focus on building so unlike any other of any other courses that you would see out there.
01:13:36.556 - 01:14:02.900, Speaker A: You actually get paid to learn and you get paired up with the best mentors out there and they give you all the support you need. We are also very glad to announce our newest hackathon, the next in the ETH India online hackathon series. This will be the ETH for all hackathon taking place from Jan 20th to fifth February.
01:14:02.900 - 01:14:36.530, Speaker A: And on that note, we're very glad to be partnering up with the government of telangana, who will be providing their support. And they're building a bunch of cool stuff, including a sandbox, which will, for the first time, let you work with the decision makers to be able to actually implement all your solutions with the folks who can make it happen. So very glad to be able to bring that.
01:14:36.530 - 01:14:49.030, Speaker A: And I have a short video that we'll be playing and it's a message from Sri Jayesh Ranjan, he's the principal secretary It and Industries, Telangana government.
01:14:53.290 - 01:14:53.846, Speaker E: Everyone.
01:14:53.948 - 01:15:16.798, Speaker F: I'm Jayesh Ranjan, I'm the principal secretary for It and Industries in the Telangana government. I wish all the delegates and participants all the very best from our side, that is from government of Telangana side. We have a very major announcement to make which is that we are starting a regulatory sandbox focused on Web 3.0.
01:15:16.798 - 01:15:45.942, Speaker F: Many of you have expressed in the past also I have met some of the leading web Three players in Hadrabad and many of them have expressed that the regulatory ambiguity which prevails in our country actually prevents them from bringing out more creative solutions, developing new products. In fact, many of you would be aware that some of the best talent actually is moving to Dubai, Singapore etc. And under the guidance of our minister for It, Mr.
01:15:45.942 - 01:16:09.566, Speaker F: KT Ramarao, we felt that we should arrest this. As a state government there are certain things which we can do and one of it is to ensure the creation of a regulatory sandbox, identify a number of use cases, bring all the government agencies together and start cohorts on different aspects of Web three application. So I'm very happy to make this announcement today.
01:16:09.566 - 01:16:44.102, Speaker F: And the other good news to share with you is that some of the national regulatory bodies also have chosen to join hands with this regulatory sandbox. So this also gives an extra level of assurance to startups, to domain experts that this regulatory sandbox experience of Hyderabad hopefully can open many more doors for them at the national level even beyond. So, look forward to industries participation, support large number of startups participating in this Sandbox activity and hope to see all of you in Hyderabad in February.
01:16:44.102 - 01:17:02.530, Speaker F: We are doing a big event in Hyderabad called ETH for all with focus on public goods. So, I invite all the delegates, all the participants, all the speakers to come to Hyderabad as well in February. And by that time, we would have made reasonably good progress on this Sandbox as well.
01:17:02.530 - 01:17:10.260, Speaker F: So, we'll be happy to share all the updates with you. Have a great year in Bangalore and all the best. Thank you very much.
01:17:12.470 - 01:17:22.390, Speaker A: Right, I'd also like to invite on stage the director of Emerging Technologies, ms. Ramadevi Lanka from the government of Telangana.
01:17:38.340 - 01:17:51.280, Speaker G: Thank you so much. Very good evening to all of you. Well, those twelve solutions that were demonstrated were just fantastic.
01:17:51.280 - 01:18:32.500, Speaker G: And on behalf of the government of Telangana, I'm saying this here that we will evaluate a couple of them to see if we can implement, especially the EV battery swap solution and other solution also will actually evaluate and see if we can implement for our use cases within the government. While you have just heard our principal secretary announcing the Sandbox, thank you announcing the setting up of the Sandbox in Telangana. So, I would just like to briefly say a few words about a State.
01:18:32.500 - 01:19:07.868, Speaker G: Most of you may know that the government of Telangana, I mean it's the first State or the youngest State set up eight years back. And we have had the opportunity to formulate innovative frameworks policies, especially in the area of emerging technologies. Ours is the first State to set up a separate wing which is called Emerging Technologies wing that focuses on new age or frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, drones, robotics and so on.
01:19:07.868 - 01:19:40.836, Speaker G: And of all these technologies, blockchain is the closest to our heart because we started working on this way back in 2018 when we launched the International Blockchain Congress event in Hyderabad. Since then, we have implemented a number of use cases within the government to solve problems at scale. So, to share a few projects that we have implemented, these range in domains such as microfinance, supply chain, supply chain.
01:19:40.836 - 01:19:55.272, Speaker G: Within the government there is lot of potential. Like because direct benefit transfers, we actually transfer cash to various millions of peoples across State. Food grains, traceability of seeds.
01:19:55.272 - 01:20:08.892, Speaker G: There is huge potential in the supply chain area. And the third one is to enhance citizen convenience. And we did an exciting project, a solution to make voting easier.
01:20:08.892 - 01:20:19.696, Speaker G: I know all of you are young here. I don't think any one of you would like to go to physical both and oat, right? Oat. I mean general elections voting.
01:20:19.696 - 01:20:50.188, Speaker G: So, we have developed an app using the web three technologies. Artificial intelligence to authenticate an individual, whether if you are the right person or the eligible voter, voting. Secondly, DLT technology to secure your votes so most of the politicians are saying that how can you ensure that the oath cast by an individual is secure? So at the back end we are using Blockchain technology to secure those.
01:20:50.188 - 01:21:02.228, Speaker G: These are fantastic applications that we have developed and we are really proud which even the Bihar government wanted to implement it. There are a range of applications that we have implemented in Blockchain. Now is the time to move to web three.
01:21:02.228 - 01:21:41.948, Speaker G: So that's why we are exploring new use cases for the government and as part of the ecosystem development, you have heard our principal secretary announcing the setting up about the land sandbox regulatory sandbox. So any startup, innovator, any organization, if you have a solution or a project that involves regulators, it could be RBI or Sebi or even a health regulator. So if you submit your solution in the sandbox, we will evaluate and bring on board the associated regulators.
01:21:41.948 - 01:22:10.148, Speaker G: That's one thing. Secondly we'll also onboard customers for your product say if it's a fintech solution and your customer is a bank we will get the banks on board to test your product to validate your solution and also provide the data that is required for your solution. So this is what we are seeing and if any regulatory changes are required our governing council will recommend these changes to the regulators.
01:22:10.148 - 01:22:18.252, Speaker G: It could be RBI, it could be Sabi, any of the regulators in India. Because as a government. We can actually do that.
01:22:18.252 - 01:22:36.480, Speaker G: So I invite all the startups innovators to make use of this sandbox. The website is web three sandbox telangana at the rate gvov in. It's actually available on our website and we've also created a discord channel.
01:22:36.480 - 01:22:58.600, Speaker G: Web Three Sandbox. Telangana web Three Sandbox. Please share your if you have any concerns on regulatory front or any issues I know most of the startups are facing that's exactly the reason why we have set up the sandbox, but we haven't had a chance to actually discuss with you or get your views in person.

But before we do that, I want to bring on a special guest here to talk about what comes next. This is almost the entire web three ecosystem here in this building.
01:36:19.586 - 01:36:36.130, Speaker B: And we want to make sure that we can figure out how do we help support everybody who wants to bring your projects to the next step and to kind of talk about that and how do we sort of continue building the web three ecosystem in india? Actually, whoop. I missed a disclaimer. Big disclaimer.
01:36:36.130 - 01:36:46.166, Speaker B: I jumped the gun. Okay, quick announcements. Everything that we just announced is tentative and not final, which means that we are going to be verifying everybody's source codes.
01:36:46.166 - 01:37:06.346, Speaker B: And if we detect that somebody has cheated or worked on something before Friday, the prizes will be removed and adjusted. So anything that you see now is assume 90% final and not 100% final. We'll be notifying you over email once everything is final, so the values might change, especially if you want a pool prize.
01:37:06.346 - 01:37:16.082, Speaker B: So keep an eye out for that. And all the prizes will be distributed on December 23. If we get this message on Discord tomorrow or today, we'll say the exact same thing.
01:37:16.082 - 01:37:28.642, Speaker B: And if we say that every time, please make sure that we have 500 projects to reply to. So it's going to take some time. And the next two weeks is when all the logistics happen for the Pride delivery.
01:37:28.642 - 01:37:37.580, Speaker B: So please be patient. And now I'd like to call in Juan Vinay from Protocol Labs to talk about how do we help take these projects further. Welcome.
01:37:47.730 - 01:37:51.742, Speaker H: All right, everyone. Great to see you. Congratulations to all of you.
01:37:51.742 - 01:38:03.262, Speaker H: This has been an amazing set of days. You have learned an enormous amount. You have invented, you have designed, you have built, you have deployed, you have tested, you have demoed, you have presented.
01:38:03.262 - 01:38:16.150, Speaker H: You are well on your way to building amazing products. In these small hours, you have taken a huge step towards building the future. Now, where to go from here? You should consider creating a Web Three startup.
01:38:16.150 - 01:38:24.774, Speaker H: Let's first talk about why India. You have an enormous amount of advantages as people in the India community. You are brilliant and hardworking.
01:38:24.774 - 01:38:37.398, Speaker H: You're super well connected online and in human networks. You're deeply technical, you're deeply product orientated. You're the largest country, you have lots of people, lots of builders, and you have huge markets.
01:38:37.398 - 01:38:48.058, Speaker H: You have lower cost of living products and services, which gives you a huge advantage over the rest of the world. You have a huge economy and it's growing super fast. And you have lots of new people joining the internet.
01:38:48.058 - 01:39:03.800, Speaker H: You have a tremendously rich and diverse culture with deep roots worldwide. And of course, you have an amazing, stable growing country that is welcoming of the Web Three community and is creating all these new regulatory sandboxes for you. So this is a phenomenal place to get going.
01:39:03.800 - 01:39:18.218, Speaker H: Now I want to call out the few logos here in the bottom. If I could get the team members of Huddle Push lighthouse, coinshift, parcel instadap to stand up for a moment. Yeah, some of them are standing up great.
01:39:18.218 - 01:39:27.274, Speaker H: So if you're interested in building a Web Three startup, look to these guys. These are your advisors. You can ask them how to get going, how to build projects.
01:39:27.274 - 01:39:37.986, Speaker H: You can get their feedback, you can ask them to help you navigate this environment. They got started right here with an East Global hackathon. They were in your shoes and they built the future.
01:39:37.986 - 01:39:46.050, Speaker H: They're now pretty fast growing startups. So now this is the startup journey. It takes a few different stages.
01:39:46.050 - 01:40:05.146, Speaker H: You're already well on your way. You're in stage two, experimenting with lots of ideas. Hackathons are the best place to get started with this because it gives you this environment tuned for learning, this environment tuned for exploration, where you can create new ideas, test them, iterate get feedback, design things and so on.
01:40:05.146 - 01:40:24.570, Speaker H: And it gives you the most important thing, which is a deadline. It gives you a deadline to present your to finish your project, it gives you a deadline to present your product and it gives you a direct feedback loop from a lot of other people, giving you the early stages towards validation. So keep doing this, keep experimenting and iterating keep hacking.
01:40:24.570 - 01:40:41.646, Speaker H: It is global hackathons and through that you'll find a strong idea and a strong solid pitch and a strong solid product. From there you can get to the second stage. I want to talk a little bit about the next stage because many of you have already aspirations of turning your projects and your products into startups.
01:40:41.646 - 01:40:58.630, Speaker H: When you go into validation, the most important part is that you get signals and feedback from the world as to whether or not they want to use your product. That is not just an idea that's cool, but is something that people want. The validation comes in different forms for many different kinds of projects.
01:40:58.630 - 01:41:16.666, Speaker H: If it's say, a consumer application or some product like that, you can just launch it and try to get users and see what they say and give you feedback. If it's a larger scale thing, like a protocol that's going to take longer to build, you can put it on GitHub, you can write about it, you can get other contributors and get going. That's how I started IPFS and FalcoIn.
01:41:16.666 - 01:41:39.154, Speaker H: That's how Ethereum got started. Now, the most important part of this stage is that you keep going and keep building and keep growing the thing and get towards traction from there. Once you have enough interest and enough evidence that the thing you're building could be a great startup, you're ready to hit the next stage, which is getting into accelerators.
01:41:39.154 - 01:41:50.710, Speaker H: Now, the acceleration part doesn't necessarily need a program, though. There are really great accelerator programs that you can leverage. These programs tend to give you initial capital and initial funding to get started as a startup.
01:41:50.710 - 01:42:09.326, Speaker H: They can help you with product market, fit, with how to hire teammates, how to find and connect with investors, and can help you in the early stages of the startup journey. These accelerators tend to be extremely great learning environments, but they're also super competitive. So what you want to do is you want to apply early and often.
01:42:09.326 - 01:42:25.058, Speaker H: When you apply, even if you get rejected, you can get a lot of feedback from them and that gives you usually a signal and a vector that you can keep iterating on and then you can apply again. So those are the three stages that you should focus on right now. Keep experimenting with ideas, keep hacking.
01:42:25.058 - 01:42:40.054, Speaker H: Sometimes it'll take 510 hackathons until you find your project to get going. Once you have something that you really want to stick with, something you feel really passionate about, something that you think has legs, get to validating it and from there, get to that acceleration stage. Good luck, India.
01:42:40.054 - 01:42:44.400, Speaker H: You're building amazing things. Let's build the future together. Thank you.
01:42:45.410 - 01:43:01.246, Speaker B: Thank you. All right, I will promise to end this in the next minutes. And to do that, I want all your support in thanking everybody that made this event possible.

01:44:09.014 - 01:44:36.714, Speaker B: I know this is small, but just look at the incredible amount of support we have from everybody in the world coming in to Bangalore to support all of you. So please give our partners a big round of applause and of course, a team that needs no introduction. Everybody on the Polio team, they have been so crucial in making sure everything is absolutely top notch in this massive now the world's biggest hackathon.

01:45:06.074 - 01:45:19.818, Speaker B: If this is the first time you've been to an Eve Global event, you might know this. But we don't want these events to be competitions. And as part of that, these events are not designed to have a first 2nd, 3rd place as a format.
01:45:19.818 - 01:45:34.290, Speaker B: And anybody we call finalists is officially a first place winner for this event. And our goal is to make sure that people get to learn. So as part of being the finalist, every person on the twelve teams that came in here will be receiving 500 USDC from the ETH Global team.
