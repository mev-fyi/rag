00:00:06.090 - 00:00:18.880, Speaker A: Good evening everyone. Thank you so much for taking the time today and coming to this presentation. Today I'm going to be talking about Samudai and what we're doing, the current Dao landscape and what we value the most when we talk about these problems.
00:00:18.880 - 00:00:33.894, Speaker A: So yeah, with that are you not able to hear me? Oh, sorry. So, yeah, we're going to be talking about a bit of the problems in the Dow landscape and what we're doing to solve them. And with that, let's get into it.
00:00:33.894 - 00:00:49.014, Speaker A: So, first of all, a quick intro about myself. I'm Kushag. I have been building in the blockchain space since like 2019 started with a decentralized media sharing platform and built on top of IPFS, built for contributor economy.
00:00:49.014 - 00:01:05.630, Speaker A: And that is how basically I got into space. Met a lot of interesting folks along the way, one of them being James from Collab Land who guided me and recommended that I join Gitcoin kernel. And that is actually where I got introduced to DAOs.
00:01:05.630 - 00:01:17.554, Speaker A: So Samudai actually is a Hindi word, it means a community. And DAOs are essentially communities and that is what we're building. So it kind of lines up over there.
00:01:17.554 - 00:01:55.554, Speaker A: And the main question I want to pose over here is are we even looking to solve the right problems in Dows? So this is not going to be like a very developer focused presentation, but we're just going to be talking about the landscape and some solution that we're building. So yeah, going through the agenda, how it started, what's going to be happening and what's the problem landscape? What are we building to solve this? And what is the collective goal look like in order to drive Dows to mainstream adoption so that they become the preferred organizational structure of the future? Yeah, let's get into it. How it started.
00:01:55.554 - 00:02:25.226, Speaker A: Where did dows come from? The term Dows or Decentralized Autonomous organization was first coined by Werner Diller back in 1997. Right. So we didn't have public blockchains back then, but he referred to it as an intelligent home system where he compared it with a human immune system, as a system which identifies, defines its responsibilities and coordinates with other regions to fulfill the system that it was designed for.
00:02:25.226 - 00:03:00.006, Speaker A: And as I mentioned, the concept of public blockchains didn't exist back then, but this still matches with the fundamental definition of what Dows are today. Speaking of a few modern definitions, institutional economics defines DAOs as digital organizations which have supplemented in order to which have risen to supplement the digital economies which are developing now. Ethnographic practices recognize DAOs as a cultural phenomena which are basically revolutionizing the way people think about organization and how work is done.
00:03:00.006 - 00:03:40.930, Speaker A: And emerging research looks at how Dows are organized, looks at the network and then talks about comparing them with the political economic entities like cities and countries. So what are DAOs? Actually? We're still evolving with the true definition of Dows, but based on our learning that some of the we've basically come to a conclusion that Dows are multi agent self organized networks with predefined rules on the blockchain which are used to limit interaction and govern the direction of the network through participation of the agents. So let's talk a bit about more about the current landscape and what's happening.
00:03:40.930 - 00:04:13.742, Speaker A: What are the problems, what are the main overarching problems that are being facing and are we solving the right problems? So according to us, the patterns that we have analyzed by speaking with a lot of people is that most dows have a participation problem, which is very ironic because the nature of dows that are being formed today are participatory. That means they require some kind of human interaction in order to define the direction of the network and synthesize on the next steps. But it's just ironic that we still have a participation problem.
00:04:13.742 - 00:04:30.654, Speaker A: We're still struggling to meet the quorum. We're still struggling to get active contributors who stick to the Dows. Secondly, awareness, awareness is a big issue because less than 18% of people in the US adults have heard of Dows.
00:04:30.654 - 00:05:09.054, Speaker A: I'm not even talking about understanding but just hearing about it. And it becomes even more difficult when we're kind of trying to build these organizational structures which will rally people around them when people have not heard of it. And thirdly, a lot of the Dao members are being treated as Dao freelancers which is not the case, which should not be the case because Dao members have a very specific use case where they have to create yeah, so Dow members are not freelancers because they have a very specific use case.
00:05:09.054 - 00:05:48.714, Speaker A: They are basically supposed to create active participation in the community, drive the network's growth and look at the next steps. Whereas freelancers are someone that Dows just engage with in order to suffice a particular very precise scope for a short period of time. So this brings us to thinking that is this because Dows are like non hierarchical? Is this because they are leaderless? But in the recent years, in the recent times we have seen that we have seen the working pods structure coming up highly autonomous working pods which give everyone the opportunity to step up and execute things in their own way.
00:05:48.714 - 00:06:14.462, Speaker A: So that means it makes a great team because now you have multiple people who can step up and execute things in their own way. And when you look at this, when you try to draw these parallels between the venture capital industry and the management consulting industry these are things that they value the most because they are looking for people who are coming with differentiated backgrounds and have varied opinions and different way of executing things. And these are some of the most sought out global jobs.
00:06:14.462 - 00:06:37.100, Speaker A: So when Dows already have this by design because of their distributed nature, why is it that Dows are not able to be attractive enough for bring this influx of web Two talent into web Three. And in order to understand more about this, let's dive deeper into the problems that are existing. Let's try to break these down and talk about them in more detail.
00:06:37.100 - 00:07:06.558, Speaker A: So, most of the problems now can be broken down into three main brackets which are members, projects and Dow level problems. Now, all of these problems are very specific in nature, they have very specific requirements, but still most of them are very important. For example, the problems that members are facing are very individualistic in nature but are very important because as we have previously defined, dows are essentially multi agent networks.
00:07:06.558 - 00:07:28.330, Speaker A: So till the time these agents are not satisfied, of course you will be facing a retention problem. Similarly, project specific problems are something that are very aligned with the project's scope, project's mission goals and vision. Whereas Dao's problems are more macroeconomical in nature and they try to govern the direction of the Dao resource allocation and how people are organized.
00:07:28.330 - 00:07:50.046, Speaker A: But from this particular diagram, this particular graphic, we can conclude we can draw some interesting insights. So for example, solving Dao wide problems will also solve a few project related problems. For example, the quality of contributors onboarding and mission alignment.
00:07:50.046 - 00:08:09.906, Speaker A: If we're able to get this right by solving them at a Dow level, we'll also be able to solve them at a project level which will just enable speed and transparency. Contributor and member related problems are being overlooked at the moment, which result in lower retention. And essentially because you are a Dow, you are trying to build a multi agent network.
00:08:09.906 - 00:08:19.260, Speaker A: These are the most important people who you should be catering to. But at the moment they are being overlooked. I mean, there are a lot of people in the space who are doing a lot of great work in order to solve this.
00:08:19.260 - 00:08:35.058, Speaker A: For example, Opolis who's working on providing healthcare benefits and kind of stability to the Dao members. But still, we have a long way to go over there. Moving on, this is something that a lot of people might differ with.
00:08:35.058 - 00:09:16.234, Speaker A: But we at Samudai feel that we should be focusing more on solving some foundational problems around DAOs, which are as simple as starting a Dao. How do I start a dao? Why should I start a dao? What are the advantages of starting a Dow if for a particular use case I have to do something? What is the best organizational structure for me? What are the legal implications of that? And how do I get it done? How does it benefit me? So till the time these barriers to entry are not removed, we won't be able to get more brains in the game. And it's very important because a lot of the innovation in the Dow ecosystem is currently been done by a few handful of peoples.
00:09:16.234 - 00:09:46.770, Speaker A: And this is something that we need to change. This is something we need to work on, because till the time we do not have more brains in the game, this is something that will stifle innovation. Secondly, building a resilient structure for community becomes very important because this is kind of like a first interaction of a contributor with a Dow and till the time you don't know what the background of the person is, they want to have a lot of prohibitions.
00:09:46.770 - 00:10:17.406, Speaker A: So like what to do on the first day, how do I contribute, who do I speak with, what do I work on? So having a resilient structure which helps people get settled in and get stuff done is very important which is being overlooked in a lot of the organizations that we're building today. And thirdly building a roadmap for contributors to grow which is very important. Now you cannot expect highly motivated individuals to come in and work in a Dow till the time they don't know how they're going to grow personally with the organization.
00:10:17.406 - 00:10:49.162, Speaker A: So having a roadmap laid out for contributor growth is something that we need to focus on. Every Dow is different so the contributor has the right to know how they're going to step up in their personal field as well if they're working with you guys. And we need to be very mindful while solving these problems because if, let's say we decentralize the talent hiring process we kind of overlook the fact where mission alignment comes into play.
00:10:49.162 - 00:11:06.222, Speaker A: So this is something that we need to be mindful about. We can solve multiple problems at once but we should be more focused on the bigger umbrella problems which affect multiple people. Talking about a few people who have been doing great work in the space.
00:11:06.222 - 00:11:25.826, Speaker A: Of course this is not extensive but a few people who just came to my mind. So these are a few people who have been doing a lot of good work. For example solving one of these solves a lot of problems superfluid solving for compensation solves also for the trust problem in the Dows.
00:11:25.826 - 00:11:58.580, Speaker A: So if, let's say I'm a contributor and I'm able to get payments streamed as I'm making progress it just makes a lot of sense for me because now I don't have to wait four weeks for a multi sick to get signed in order to get paid. But now I'm able to establish that stability part of it where I'm able to just pay my bills as I go. Moving on, what have other people been saying about this? And I mean coordination problems are not new, right? They have been discussed at length much before us.
00:11:58.580 - 00:12:28.922, Speaker A: Our web two counterparts have been facing these coordination problems before us and they have been able to solve this in a much more, much more efficient manner. So why don't we take a page from their book and try to do this in a much efficient manner. So what we realize is that there's a lot of time being spent in managing dependencies instead of eliminating them.
00:12:28.922 - 00:13:22.074, Speaker A: And when you eliminate these dependencies, that is what in turn reduces the coordination problems and that is something that we should be focusing on. And according to the web two counterparts, building trust will give way to speed pods and highly autonomous working groups have been a great addition to this because they have enabled people to work in smaller groups in a much more speedy manner without any external influence or effect. So now coming down to what are we building at Samudai and how are we looking to solve these problems at Samudai? We are building this foundational layer which acts like an operating system for Dows and enables visibility, participation and builds transparency which in turn helps you in building trust.
00:13:22.074 - 00:13:52.530, Speaker A: So now we are building this fully customizable web Three dashboard where you can come in, plug all the applications you want to use, you're already using and get stuff done in the way that you want to. So it is important that we understand that in order to optimize for participation, we need to bring the information to the community. We cannot expect a contributor to go to five different places and look at all the information and then contribute.
00:13:52.530 - 00:14:12.334, Speaker A: Only highly motivated individuals would do that and that is not how you would be able to enable much more participation. Next, we're building for investment Dows. So investment Dows are some of the most serious Dows out there.
00:14:12.334 - 00:14:31.666, Speaker A: They have been constantly innovating. For example, Kaufman Fellows, the globally around Kaufman Fellows recently built VC three Dow and we have already seen orange Dow working in with the YC alumni. So they are some of the serious Dows and they are doing most of the innovation out there.
00:14:31.666 - 00:14:49.786, Speaker A: So they kind of look like an overlooked use case for us. And we built out the infrastructure to reduce boilerplate and make sure they get done work publicly. So now if, let's say I'm a community member in an investment Dow, I know exactly what is going on, what exactly everyone is speaking on.
00:14:49.786 - 00:15:05.310, Speaker A: And this is the power of discussions. This is the power that we enable when we basically bring these discussion, organize them in a way where people can find them. It becomes very difficult when it's happening behind the wall gardens of discord.
00:15:05.310 - 00:15:22.546, Speaker A: So yeah, moving on, we have a Web Three contributor profile which aggregates information from everywhere you do. But I mean, a lot of people are building Web Three profiles. So what's different about it? It's important to realize that people update profile only on one place.
00:15:22.546 - 00:15:39.654, Speaker A: They might hone a profile everywhere, but they're only active on one particular place and we at some of that. Make sure that wherever that place is, your Samudai profile stays up to date. So now all you have to do is claim your Samudai subdomain and share away.
00:15:39.654 - 00:16:12.180, Speaker A: So all your contributions, all your work, all your work that you have been doing will now be able to share in one click. We have also been speaking with some industry leaders like Karma and Disco in order to make this more robust and resilient so that people can get work done more composably even if they choose not to go with some of all their data, stays safe and stays with them. Next, we're building the networking and communication layer which is very big problem.
00:16:12.180 - 00:16:36.186, Speaker A: I mean, networking is such a big problem that when LinkedIn came up with these features they kind of revolutionized the way networking worked. They were able to bring this kind of revolution where you can now have a look at everything that a person is doing and also reach out to them at the same point. We haven't been able to solve this in web three yet and we guys are building towards it.
00:16:36.186 - 00:17:02.180, Speaker A: So now this will now enable people to look up people for help, ask for collaboration and also give rise to new business model for people who are building on this. For example, mentoring as a business model, mentoring as a service. If, let's say, someone likes you and wants to get in touch with you for some help, you can basically monetize that and get stuff done.
00:17:02.180 - 00:17:13.094, Speaker A: And yeah, we're basically enabling a lot of functionalities. We don't want to reinvent the wheel. We're trying to work with a lot of industry partners in order to get stuff done in the easiest way possible.
00:17:13.094 - 00:17:39.706, Speaker A: And we're also incorporating a lot of infrastructure plays inside us so that we don't waste our time and we can just provide the best functionality possible so that people can get work done in the easiest way possible. And last but not the least, we are working on our project aggregator. So this is something, this becomes powerful because right now dows are managing their workflows in three to five different places.
00:17:39.706 - 00:18:11.958, Speaker A: And if I'm a contributor, in order to stay up to date with what's happening with me, in order to get an idea of what happened while I was offline, I have to keep up with everything. And this becomes powerful because now everything a contributor is doing anywhere is getting directly mapped through decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable credentials. So this becomes a building block to a customizable reputation network which in turn enables better governance delegation.
00:18:11.958 - 00:18:42.530, Speaker A: Because now if I'm a person who's trying to source talent, I'm able to query people based on the metrics that I find most value in. And the best part is that because DIDs and VCs are such a powerful technological innovation, they enable us to do it in a privacy preserving manner. Moving on, we're still early, we still have a long way to go where Dows become a viable career option.
00:18:42.530 - 00:19:01.046, Speaker A: So this is what we kind of describe as the path to dowing. Something you like. We're kind of in a phase where we're just trying to create more awareness but we need to take these steps so that we can kind of get to a place where your parents identified Dows as a viable career option for you.
00:19:01.046 - 00:19:35.858, Speaker A: And in order to get there, it's important that we get more brains in the game. It's important to understand that we need more innovation so that we can have varied use cases which in turn, attract multiple people who are not already in the space. And this becomes even more important because Dows as an organizational structure are very user focused, and this won't happen till the time we have more participation, more awareness, and creating awareness and getting more people on board is the first step to do this.
00:19:35.858 - 00:19:48.262, Speaker A: Only then will we be able to achieve ecosystem growth and build dows as a robust organizational structure. And then, of course, a viable career option for anyone who's trying to join the field. Yeah.
00:19:48.262 - 00:20:15.346, Speaker A: Lastly, the collective goals of the ecosystem in order to enable this would be, of course, as I mentioned, to solve for foundational problems, which enable people to join in and get work done, which enable people to join in and just contribute or learn about the space without feeling dumb. And, yeah, it's important that we learn, experiment, break things, and repeat it in a fast manner. And the more people we get at it, it's the better.
00:20:15.346 - 00:20:23.140, Speaker A: And it's important to realize that we can't innovate alone. We need more heads in the game. We need more brain in the game.
00:20:23.140 - 00:20:53.934, Speaker A: And I personally believe in that vision where I am able to design my entire workday in the future. I'm able to contribute to the organizations I feel most aligned with I'm able to contribute with the organizations that I feel most inclined with without having to do anything else on the side. So, yeah, with that, I would like to ask you all for I would like to ask you all for your help.
00:20:53.934 - 00:21:03.326, Speaker A: If you want to work with us, build with us. If you are aligned towards the same vision, let's work together and let's build this together. And yeah.
00:21:03.326 - 00:21:15.542, Speaker A: Thank you so much, guys. This is my telegram. If you guys want to reach out, talk to me or anything or right.
00:21:15.542 - 00:21:20.838, Speaker A: So thank you so much for your time, guys. Thank you so much for taking your time. Yeah.
00:21:20.838 - 00:21:21.940, Speaker A: Jsamudai guys.
