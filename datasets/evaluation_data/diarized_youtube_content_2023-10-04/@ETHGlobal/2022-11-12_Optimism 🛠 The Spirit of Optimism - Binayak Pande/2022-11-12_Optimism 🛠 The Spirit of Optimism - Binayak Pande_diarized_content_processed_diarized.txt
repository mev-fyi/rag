00:00:06.330 - 00:00:11.742, Speaker A: Hey, can you guys hear me? Hey, GM. Everybody. We're going to make this pretty fun.
00:00:11.742 - 00:00:22.238, Speaker A: I'm going to give you a brief overview of optimism. So, like everything that we're about, obviously we're scaling Ethereum. But we're not just scaling Ethereum's tech, we're scaling its values as well.
00:00:22.238 - 00:00:33.602, Speaker A: So unfortunately, I can't edit the notes on the side. So is going to be this view, but hope everyone's having a nice day. So before beginning, I just want to talk a little bit about incentive structures.
00:00:33.602 - 00:00:47.114, Speaker A: Like what are we doing here? What is crypto? Right? We live in a world of perpetual personal incentives that are pretty individualistic. It's passed down to us from society. Go to this college, get this job, do this thing, retire four hundred and one K, all that stuff.
00:00:47.114 - 00:01:00.190, Speaker A: And a lot of times these are harmful, right? Like the environment's not doing great. There's a lot of selfish motives in the world. But what crypto allows us to do, very interestingly, is reprogram some of these incentives that we've been taught our whole lives.
00:01:00.190 - 00:01:16.322, Speaker A: So there is a mysticism found in blockchains that we don't find in any other technology. The superpower lies in the ability to reprogram incentive models that have been passed down throughout society, right? So enter ethereum. Ethereum lets you program money.
00:01:16.322 - 00:01:28.278, Speaker A: Money lets you program incentives and incentives lets you program novel social structures. What this means is now anyone can program incentives. You don't have to be a king to make a new governance system.
00:01:28.278 - 00:01:47.070, Speaker A: You don't have to be chairman of the Fed to make a new monetary policy. You can be in the basement and do this. You don't have to be a Hollywood artist to get exposure for your artwork and get royalties and get paid well, right? So this also lines in with this idea of the unbundling of everything that I think we're seeing in societies currently.
00:01:47.070 - 00:01:59.054, Speaker A: So this is a great example of it in the form of the media, right? People magazine. This was like the dominant thing back in the day of everyone would read People magazine, this was the thing. And then came the kardashians.
00:01:59.054 - 00:02:04.594, Speaker A: The Kardashians took over People magazine. People were now following this family. And I was like, whoa, okay, great.
00:02:04.594 - 00:02:21.186, Speaker A: And then came TikTok influencers. It's like, whoa, anyone can now create content and be seen. And it's this idea of the unbundling, right? Now any individual who has a mission, who has a unique thing they want to express in the world, can express in it, can express it through crypto.
00:02:21.186 - 00:02:36.000, Speaker A: The similar thing can happen within banks, right? You have these large institutions that are doing certain things. Now. Some people who are friends in a basement can program structures that end up having billions of dollars in TBL that people use for banking, right? It goes along the wave of unbundling everything.
00:02:36.000 - 00:02:51.810, Speaker A: So I think we all know that Ethereum is the best city in the world, right? Everyone wants to be on Ethereum. Everyone wants to go there, spend time, but it can get crowded. Like, when there's a lot of people in one spot, you get traffic jams, you get a lot of fuss.
00:02:51.810 - 00:03:16.858, Speaker A: How do we fix that? Enter optimism, right? So just like how big cities need skyscrapers and subways to operate properly, ethereum needs optimism. We are kind of providing the skyscrapers and the transport layer and everything for Ethereum to scale in a way and make that city that I was mentioning here more livable. But we don't just scale Ethereum's tech, we actually scale its values as well.
00:03:16.858 - 00:03:34.474, Speaker A: How do we do that? Through this thing called retroactive public goods funding. So if you look at the fees that Ethereum generates just today, it generated $5 million, 5 million. That's a lot, right? But where is this money going? Mainly, it used to go to miners.
00:03:34.474 - 00:03:48.070, Speaker A: Now it's going like validators, et cetera. It's going to specific people in a way, but it's not necessarily going to the community as much as maybe we would like. So with optimism, this is optimism sequencer revenue.
00:03:48.070 - 00:04:03.050, Speaker A: We're just starting out average of about $30,000 a day. Imagine what this can be as Ethereum scales and as L two scale for the future. Like, this will just continue growing up in that trajectory, right? This is just the beginning.
00:04:03.050 - 00:04:25.550, Speaker A: 100% of these fees that are generated daily go back towards the community, goes back towards public goods. So we've pioneered this model called retroactive public goods funding, where we essentially like, if you want to create a public good, you want to do something for free. You want to create educational content for the world, you can do so and know that you'll get retroactively funded by optimism.
00:04:25.550 - 00:04:39.734, Speaker A: One of the things is, I think we live in a society that where if you want to do good, you kind of have to be a financial martyr. Like, you want to go help the world, you're going to have to be like, oh, I'm not going to get paid as much as a banker or as an NBA superstar. We think that's wrong.
00:04:39.734 - 00:04:59.674, Speaker A: I think we stand a chance doing what we do in this space to reprogram that model, to reprogram that incentive. And we aim to do that by removing the opportunity cost of doing things that benefit the greater good through Rpgf. So now who decides where these fees go? Right? Like, there's all these fees, they're going to get bigger, we're going to scale more.
00:04:59.674 - 00:05:20.094, Speaker A: Who decides it? Well, around I think May, we had our AirDrop and we started our governance collective. So the governance system, which has two houses, gets to decide where these public goods profit, where that network revenue I showed earlier goes, essentially. So who gets retroactively funded for it? Right? This is a little meme.
00:05:20.094 - 00:05:28.802, Speaker A: So initially, just like, profit motive solves everything. Donation funding, okay, that helps quadratic funding a bit better. Retroactive public good funding.
00:05:28.802 - 00:05:41.186, Speaker A: Let's go, right? So this is a real world example of this. Let's say right now I want to plant trees. My contribution to humanity is I want to go and plant trees.
00:05:41.186 - 00:05:55.054, Speaker A: Now, I walk over, I see a VC, I'm like, hey, VC, can you give me $5,000 to plant some trees? It's for the good of the world. The VC looks at me in the face and laughs at me. He's like, Why would I do that? There's no return on investment for me.
00:05:55.054 - 00:06:12.306, Speaker A: Why would I do that? That's the pessimistic world of today, the optimistic world of tomorrow and today, because we've already done this is same thing. Now I want $5,000 to plant my trees. I go to a VC and I say, if I do a good job with this, the Optimism Collective is going to retroactively fund me for this.
00:06:12.306 - 00:06:22.662, Speaker A: Now, a VC is looking at this and being like, that's an interesting model. Like, yes, I'll bet on you, right? Every investment a venture capitalist makes, for example, is like an investment in a person. Like, oh, maybe they'll succeed here.
00:06:22.662 - 00:06:33.142, Speaker A: They have a clear sign of an outcome where if they succeed, they might get retroactively funded. So that's a real world example of what Rpgf can become. And of course, it's not just limited to planting trees.
00:06:33.142 - 00:06:55.490, Speaker A: Like, everything from building infrastructure to educational content to pretty much everything, that's an open source public good. So we fund public goods through network activity. So as people use optimism, as you deploy an optimism or do anything on our network, it goes to feed these fees, then goes to this pot of retroactive funding, then governance votes on where that funding goes.
00:06:55.490 - 00:07:13.106, Speaker A: So what's happening with the network? Why would you want to use our network, right? What do you want to do, and what can optimism provide to you? So before that, the state of roll ups today. So up and to the right. Obviously, everyone's heard of roll ups.
00:07:13.106 - 00:07:30.070, Speaker A: Now it's growing. A lot of folks are using roll ups, right? Like, I think we hit almost six, wow, $6 billion in TVL across all L two S on ethereum. So there's a lot of traction and obviously, there's a lot of fees that are being generated, as I explained before, but it's cheap.
00:07:30.070 - 00:07:41.178, Speaker A: But maybe it's not cheap enough. There'll still be some alt L ones in the world that are like, we're cheaper than you and all that. Second, is there's a little more decentralization needed, right, with a sequencer, with clients, et cetera.
00:07:41.178 - 00:08:03.670, Speaker A: And lastly, some people might ask, what else? What else can a roll up do except for just scaling this and making it cheaper and faster and all of that? So to address the first one, we do a little fee reduction. So we actually live in a world where we're planning on roll up fees going to zero, and we're going to achieve that through proto dank sharding. So it's called EIP 4844.
00:08:03.670 - 00:08:57.990, Speaker A: And Liam, who's over there, and Protolambda and a bunch of Mophi and a bunch of people from the Op Labs client team have been working on this and trying to do this for everybody because EIP 4844 actually benefits every single roll up out there. We strongly believe that a rising tide lifts all boats. So EIP 4844 and a quick explanation of that, which I'm going to try to do the best I don't have my notes on here, is a toilet metaphor, right? So how can we think about what EIP four A four four is or EIP four a four four? So let's say you're like in line at a crowded festival and you're going to the Ben's bathroom, right? The toilet only has stalls, so regardless of if you're like peeing or pooping, you have to use the stall, right? Obviously a number one takes less time than number two, so it's not hyper efficient for everyone to be doing using the same stall.
00:08:57.990 - 00:09:12.014, Speaker A: You can solve this problem by adding a Urinal, and essentially Urinals are only used by people who need to pee. At least I hope so. Now, the toilet has two separate lines you can go to.
00:09:12.014 - 00:09:36.998, Speaker A: So what does this example actually mean? Well, in this case, the toilet is Ethereum, the toilet stalls are blocks, poops are transactions, p is data, p in a stall is call data, and Urinals are Blobs and the lines are the fee market. So the upgrade is EIP 4844. It's just essentially making it more efficient, right? Like not having everyone go to the same line, but have certain people go to lines that are more efficient for them.
00:09:36.998 - 00:09:49.622, Speaker A: So that was a Twitter thread written by Razu ETH. It's pretty good analogy there. Okay, and second thing we're doing, so this is about multi client architecture.
00:09:49.622 - 00:10:10.330, Speaker A: We are launching Bedrock soon, which essentially is like a pragmatic way for us to start decentralizing. What Bedrock encompasses is theoretically optimal. Call, data submission, consensus and execution, client separation, a microscopic client difference, only 500 lines of code, faster peer to peer networking.
00:10:10.330 - 00:10:29.442, Speaker A: And all of this is basically in tandem with our idea to not just become EVM equivalent, which we already are, but to become Ethereum equivalent at the very core. This also allows us to easily plug in EIP 4844 when it's ready, which should be soon as well. It also has smarter sync, sequencing and state submission.
00:10:29.442 - 00:10:38.990, Speaker A: So Bedrock, it's coming out soon. And if you ever want to read up more on it, we have multiple articles, multiple Twitter threads that explain a bunch. As always, our code is always open source.
00:10:38.990 - 00:10:52.394, Speaker A: We build everything openly so you can access that. Lastly, I think this is something I'm very, very stoked about is the idea of the Op stack. So the optimism code base has been forked multiple times.
00:10:52.394 - 00:11:00.638, Speaker A: There's been a bunch of roll ups that have actually been using our code base and we're open source. We're very much ready for that. That's something that we will always be.
00:11:00.638 - 00:11:23.154, Speaker A: But we realized when people forked our code base, they started doing interesting things with it. Like they would mess around with DA layers, they'd add something else and it would be this new custom solution using the original stack that was forked. So we took a long hard look at that and we were like, okay, what if we make that easier? What if we make it even easier for someone to do that? And then came the birth of the Op stack.
00:11:23.154 - 00:11:42.700, Speaker A: So I think one way to think about it, and this Tweet kind of explains it, is you can basically deploy a roll up however you wish with fully customizable features, right? Like you want a ZK roll up that uses like Celestia for a data availability layer. You can go and do that. You want extra throughput, you want to use another DA layer, you can go and do that.
00:11:42.700 - 00:11:51.774, Speaker A: We're making it as easy to deploy a roll up as plugging in APIs in Web Two. So you wanted like bits and pieces. You want to do bitcoin roll up.
00:11:51.774 - 00:12:07.006, Speaker A: Like whatever it is, you can actually experiment and that's what the Op stack enables you to do. It's like we're fully making it very easy to run multiple experiments on the future of roll ups and whatever you want to create. With that comes the idea of the super chain.
00:12:07.006 - 00:12:14.854, Speaker A: So let's say the Op stack is there. We have a bunch of different Op chains. People are building crazy sorts of roll ups and now you want to connect them.
00:12:14.854 - 00:12:36.830, Speaker A: Now you're like, okay, I want all this to feed into one larger thing. Luckily, because the way the Op stack is structured, because everyone's using the same stack is you can actually have atomic composability. So because this idea of shared sequencing where you have all these op chains, they all use like this shared sequencing model, you can basically connect all these op chains together into what we call the superchain.
00:12:36.830 - 00:13:00.598, Speaker A: Where this becomes interesting is basically the idea that the hardest thing right now to kind of deploy a roll up or anything in the space is you can do the tech, you can deploy your own chain, you can deploy and roll up, but then you have to do business development, right? Like you have to try to get an Ave on board or you have to get all these DApps on board. And that takes a lot of time and that takes a lot of effort. And a lot of times people just want to build cool stuff.
00:13:00.598 - 00:13:27.386, Speaker A: So how do you build cool stuff without having to worry about the whole like, oh no, how do I do this negotiation? How do I do this partnership? The superchain kind of enables that because you can create this off chain however you want. It's connected to all the other chains. It's connected to optimism mainnet, you want to do something that's on optimism mainnet, you can make it really easy for messages to pass through and basically interact with stuff that are on other chains.
00:13:27.386 - 00:13:38.686, Speaker A: So it literally allows you to make really cool stuff that you've always wanted to do. Not have to worry too much about liquidity because everything's connected. But that is a super chain and it's a work in progress.
00:13:38.686 - 00:13:49.714, Speaker A: I think when bedrock is released, this is going to be easier to actually use. We do have one example of an Op chain of sorts that's already come out by the folks at Latice. It was called Op craft.
00:13:49.714 - 00:13:59.430, Speaker A: It's essentially a full Voxel game. That's its own blockchain and it was built on bedrock. So literally like an entire game, that's its own blockchain.
00:13:59.430 - 00:14:24.430, Speaker A: If you were to hack on it, you can make like an AMM that's like in a cave somewhere or something. So that's just like one example, I think the Op stack and the superchain kind of enables multiple avenues and we kind of have released this thing and we'll see what can get built on it. But it's allowing for full composability, it's allowing people to run experiments and connecting all of them together into one larger super chain.
00:14:24.430 - 00:14:54.406, Speaker A: So I think this is a question that comes around a lot as well, is like, what is our path to decentralization? So our path to decentralization larger sorry, 2023, we want to create a fall proof which proves L two bedrock blocks. We want to work towards decentralized sequencer selection FIAP, then deploy bonded sequencer using single client faultproof with instant upgrade keys. Sequencer auctions.
00:14:54.406 - 00:15:12.030, Speaker A: These are works in progress. I wouldn't say it's like hyper finalized, but these are ways that we are currently might be thinking about it. And then by 2024, deploy bonded sequencer using multi client faultproof without instant upgrade keys and then we reach a world where we're a bit more decentralized and can look towards a future.
00:15:12.030 - 00:15:31.350, Speaker A: So to kind of summarize a few things here, what we're really aiming for is solving the blockchain trilemma and optimism is getting closer and closer towards being in that middle spot right there. This is our ecosystem at this point. Lots more lots more protocols being added every day.
00:15:31.350 - 00:15:48.060, Speaker A: And I think when we look at what I just mentioned with the Op chains and the superchain at large, we'll have a lot of different things as well. You name it. Like, you want a bitcoin ZK, roll up, different DA layer, all of these things are possible and we're excited to see what you guys will build.
00:15:48.060 - 00:16:24.030, Speaker A: Thank you. Happy to take any questions right now. Yeah, so we did a Rpgf round, we did a first one and don't remember the exact list, but solidity aragon ether scan.
00:16:24.030 - 00:16:34.620, Speaker A: There's a bunch a like, bunch of public open source things that helped Ethereum because we're doing public goods that help both optimism and ethereum. Yeah, those are those? Round one.
00:16:40.430 - 00:16:41.034, Speaker B: Cool.
00:16:41.152 - 00:17:02.636, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry I can't quite speak on that right now, but yeah, currently it is a governance token that is used. The power there is again, you have the network fees that I showed you back here. Ethereum does like 5 million a day.
00:17:02.636 - 00:17:11.144, Speaker A: Roll ups are going to scale larger and larger. The fees for our roll ups are increasing pretty much every day. Average of like forty k a day, I think right now.
00:17:11.144 - 00:17:34.262, Speaker A: And the governance token basically helps allocate where this funding because all this fee revenue goes into this pot of Rpgf. The token helps decide where that funding goes retroactively. That's an interesting question, I think.
00:17:34.262 - 00:17:44.330, Speaker A: Are there gitcoin folks here? We should have a conversation. Yeah, I'll keep you in the loop, but yeah, that'll be awesome. Cheers.
00:17:44.330 - 00:18:29.210, Speaker A: Do you guys have any crazy Op chain ideas? What's like the craziest thing you can think of? Okay, I'm going to leave it here for a little bit just in case. Let these questions marinate a bit. Yeah, anything.
00:18:29.210 - 00:18:39.596, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. Yeah, great question. So I think a few things.
00:18:39.596 - 00:18:54.684, Speaker A: I believe Nitro might have changed this, but for a really long time we were the only EVM equivalent roll up. So we had the OVM before and we were like, okay, let's move this a little bit. Let's be as equivalent to Ethereum as possible.
00:18:54.684 - 00:19:04.432, Speaker A: So we moved towards EVM equivalents, which for any DAP developer just makes it a lot easier to deploy an optimism. It's just like literally chain ID switching. So that's one.
00:19:04.432 - 00:19:30.990, Speaker A: I think the other thing is also the public goods funding route where all of our network repeats will go back towards our community. The bet there is if you have a community where you continuously invest in its public infrastructure, you'll basically have a place that's easier to build in, that just has more structure, has more bedrock foundations that can supercharge the power like the apps of the future. That's one of the main differences, I'd say.
00:19:30.990 - 00:19:51.550, Speaker A: Let's see. Yeah, also one other thing that is different is because of bedrock that's going to basically surcharge a lot of these differences a lot more because we allow for multiple clients that unlocks a whole series of use cases. Like you can have a ZK client on bedrock basically as well.
00:19:51.550 - 00:20:18.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we'll have to see. Yeah, it's all really fresh right now. Does that come out yet? Okay, I see.
00:20:18.890 - 00:20:25.660, Speaker A: Yeah. Liam's our CEO.
00:20:28.960 - 00:20:37.230, Speaker B: Yeah. Basically. What's the deal with Zke EVM? I think the whole idea with the Op stack is that all these things are pretty plug and play.
00:20:37.230 - 00:20:52.180, Speaker B: If you want to have a ZK fold proof, whether that's with EVM or whether that's with MIPS or Risk or some other like, it's kind of whatever you want. There's multiple products building these things. Like there's the Hermes one, there's scrolls, there's Risk zero doing it for Risk.
00:20:52.180 - 00:21:06.744, Speaker B: ZK Sync has their own kind of custom thing. From my standpoint, eventually these are going to be solved. It might take a few years until we get a really performant one that anyone can run, but if it's not open source, I think the community will reject it.
00:21:06.744 - 00:21:26.812, Speaker B: So it'll have to be open source. And the whole idea that we have from our approach is like just focus on the community first, focus on the governance, focus on the funding distribution and then plug in the proof system later. So from our standpoint, we basically think whichever one of these ZK approaches wins is the one that we'll use.
00:21:26.812 - 00:21:47.792, Speaker B: And we're probably going to start finding ones that we want to even start funding or supporting to start competing to be one of the options that people can use for their proof system. I think it's kind of weird historically how we've ended up in this world where there's like optimistic roll ups and ZK roll ups as this competitive thing in this L two industry. Because fundamentally we're just building core infrastructure to scale Ethereum.
00:21:47.792 - 00:22:11.420, Speaker B: And I think that I think it's a mistake to kind of think of these things as competitive right now. Over the long term, the whole point this technology is going to commoditize and the interesting thing is going to be the community on top and what kind of worlds you build with your own chain infrastructure, which, by the way, is very interesting. Why Cosmos? The Cosmos app chain thesis I think is very worth revisiting.
00:22:11.420 - 00:22:23.084, Speaker B: And I think there's probably a world where on Ethereum we start seeing way more app chains emerge. So I would also look into that. If you're a hacker trying to figure out what to work on, you don't necessarily have to go into the app layer.
00:22:23.084 - 00:22:28.950, Speaker B: There's still a ton of stuff to work on lower down. Yeah, anyway, sorry, it's a long winded answer.
00:22:33.190 - 00:22:56.330, Speaker C: How do you get more user protocol? And then those layers do offer their own, but there's also provide a more direct path to layer two. Kind of an open question.
00:23:01.020 - 00:23:24.416, Speaker B: How will users get onto L Two? So I think one big category is the really obvious one, which is like people that could not use Ethereum, that want to use Ethereum but can't afford it. That class of people, I think they've either just left or they went to Polygon or maybe they went to Binance smart chain and maybe they are using some application there. But it's not like they're going to just stay there.
00:23:24.416 - 00:23:43.216, Speaker B: It's like their favorite place in the world. They're going to all of a time shop around for where's the ecosystem going to the future. And so I think that category of people will likely, once it's clear, like hey, there's an alternative from these less from these centralized chains to use ethereum again, then I think they might begin to flock over to optimism.
00:23:43.216 - 00:23:54.010, Speaker B: Because they see this is like a better way to still have the sense of security and decentralization and ethereum community alignment that they want. And so they'll maybe flock back in. But you're thinking more with the technology.
00:23:54.010 - 00:24:14.348, Speaker B: I think that's, again, kind of all at this point, like the standard playbook, right? Every exchange should have a deposit and a withdrawal flow. Any on ramp, off ramp, all over the world at this point, there's all these companies, they should just have an optimism integration on our side. There's like a whole partnerships team just going all over the place, like making sure we have all those integrations.
00:24:14.348 - 00:24:38.004, Speaker B: But I think a lot of those are just like existing crypto users. The more interesting thing is if we actually have the ability to say, hey, Ethereum is cheap and it works the way you thought it did, it's like less than a penny for anything. Then all of a sudden now Ethereum, the product of Ethereum, which is what we're trying to effectively scale with optimism, will be in the next bull market particularly will be super cheap.
00:24:38.004 - 00:24:50.300, Speaker B: And so any of those people that went to Ethereum and Churned, they can actually now actually stick around. And so it could just be the net new audiences that come in the next bull market. What that is, is a big open question.
00:24:50.300 - 00:24:54.830, Speaker B: But I think that's probably the more important one is where will the net new users come.
00:25:04.450 - 00:25:13.534, Speaker C: From? High level? How did they think of how much should they store on the layer one versus layer two?
00:25:13.732 - 00:25:30.866, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. So the question is how much money should you store on l One versus on L Two? I think I would think of these as like tiers of temperature of your money. Like if your money is really cold, you're never going to touch it.
00:25:30.866 - 00:25:38.710, Speaker B: You just want it in your like you want ave USD. You just keep it in one place. It's your savings account, it's your money under your mattress kind of situation.
00:25:38.710 - 00:25:49.866, Speaker B: Then probably you want to keep it on L One because it's like nothing's going to change. It's just a net kind of ossified almost system. You're just like, okay, that's like with Bitcoin, right? It's not going to change.
00:25:49.866 - 00:25:59.520, Speaker B: So you can keep your money there. You can feel pretty safe at night on the L Two S. You want to probably have more of your money that you're going to use regularly, right? Like it's more of a checking account.
00:25:59.520 - 00:26:08.226, Speaker B: Maybe once a week, once a month. You kind of use this money for some reason. Either you're leveraging something, you're saving something, you're spending it, you're sending it.
00:26:08.226 - 00:26:25.800, Speaker B: Then L Two should kind of occupy more of the actual human usage. So it might also divide up the users to be more like you have bots and user and humans on L Two and then you have large institutions and hardware wallets on L One. That might be what happens, but it's hard to tell.
00:26:39.310 - 00:26:40.122, Speaker C: In general.
00:26:40.256 - 00:26:41.260, Speaker A: In the future.
00:26:41.790 - 00:27:00.720, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a few. One interesting one is 4444, which is kind of a history expiry. It's more like the lack of a necessity for clients to store long term history.
00:27:00.720 - 00:27:22.310, Speaker B: For example, right now if you're like the Geth team or if you're our team also every time there's some evolution to ethereum that changes the way it works. You're not upgrading your software, deleting a bunch of the old code, you have to add new code and also maintain all the old code. So the Geth team has maintain all of the code from every previous hard fork and it all has to work perfectly.
00:27:22.310 - 00:27:32.806, Speaker B: And that's an enormous amount of technical debt. So 4444 removes a huge amount of technical debt. And the reason why that's important for L Two S is that on L two S you are reusing the client software.
00:27:32.806 - 00:27:41.674, Speaker B: At least that's what we're doing and that's what Arbitram now is doing too. So you want that software to be minimal and simple and have the minimum possible technical debt. So that's a big one.
00:27:41.674 - 00:28:06.766, Speaker B: Another one is beam sync. I don't know the number, but beam sync is really interesting because it makes your wow, there's a lot of folks all of a sudden beamsync is really interesting because it enables you to sync a node from a lazy loading perspective. So instead of syncing block by block or syncing with merkel proofs or syncing sort of like through many proofs, you sync as you execute.
00:28:06.766 - 00:28:23.946, Speaker B: So you want to run a transaction and your EVM trace reads gets to a point where it's like, hey, I don't have this data. Find other nodes that have the data and then sync it. And the reason why that's important is that the way a fault proof works is that it's the exact same process where you execute the code and all of a sudden you don't have the data.
00:28:23.946 - 00:28:41.120, Speaker B: So you need to get a merkel proof to show that the data exists in some state route. So it makes the fault proof execution code look identical to the execution code, period. So again, it lowers the diff even more for writing an L Two, which is again, it's the whole philosophy that we have with the design.
00:28:41.120 - 00:29:15.494, Speaker B: I want to mention one more wonderfully fast shout out. I think it's also a good hackathon kind of thing to think about is that eventually the EVM is going to ossify and you're going to have kind of L Two EVM, right? L two S can be an experimental ground for creating your own version of the EVM. So you can imagine a world where there's like an optimism with account abstraction and you can experiment with account abstraction on an L Two because you can actually get the whole ecosystem of the technology around the EIP.
00:29:15.494 - 00:29:27.302, Speaker B: Like the developer tooling, the Geth changes, the solidity changes and so on the wallet changes, all working on a main net production roll up. Before it's on l one. So l two EVM.
00:29:27.302 - 00:29:34.926, Speaker B: And the evolution of the EIP process in general is also, like, a really important category for people to think about. Is there another workshop?
00:29:34.958 - 00:29:35.490, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:29:35.640 - 00:29:39.218, Speaker B: Okay. Oh, it's polygon. All right.
00:29:39.218 - 00:29:40.190, Speaker B: Go, Polygon.
00:29:40.270 - 00:29:40.546, Speaker A: All right.
00:29:40.568 - 00:29:40.960, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone.
