00:00:07.130 - 00:00:13.770, Speaker A: I guess this is my first ETH global, so I'm not sure what to expect. There's no code over here, which is a business, I guess. Workshop.
00:00:13.770 - 00:00:21.934, Speaker A: I'm going to talk about two things. One, I'm going to talk about how to leverage apecoin dow. And then we're going to have a little announcement about the prize pools later on.
00:00:21.934 - 00:00:34.578, Speaker A: And also I want to explain about the Asia opportunity, which I think is relevant since I'm finding that in this part of the world, people do not know the opportunity that exists in Asia. And there's a lot that could be done here. All of you are building great projects.
00:00:34.578 - 00:00:45.194, Speaker A: You want to raise money, you want to go and get new audiences. Asia is where it's at, we think. So let me just very quickly, I'm actually wearing an apecoin hat today.
00:00:45.194 - 00:00:55.306, Speaker A: I used to be a special council member. But very quickly, just telling you a little bit about myself and the business, we're very focused on digital property rights. We've been trying to advance Web Three for a while.
00:00:55.306 - 00:01:07.442, Speaker A: We've done over 450 investments in the space. So, yes, if you are interested in getting some money for your Web Three projects, you can come talk to me and my team later on. And we're one of the sort of biggest investors in the space.
00:01:07.442 - 00:01:10.370, Speaker A: All right, let's get into it. Asia. I'll start with that first.
00:01:10.370 - 00:01:16.998, Speaker A: So. South Asia, southeast Asia. North Asia represents over 54% of the entire crypto market today.
00:01:16.998 - 00:01:33.370, Speaker A: And it's really growing very fast when it comes to total volume of trade. India, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore are top, and Japan, obviously, Korea and Hong Kong are coming along very quickly. And again, they represent actually the majority of crypto trading.
00:01:33.370 - 00:01:47.406, Speaker A: One of the reasons why Asia is so big in crypto is actually it's a digital first culture. So you can't really see the screen quite well here. But what you see here are basically two beggars, actually all beggars in China, basically beg with WeChat pay.
00:01:47.406 - 00:01:55.294, Speaker A: So instead of asking for cash, they ask you to put money in their digital wallet. And that's been going on basically for years and years and years. And so this is not unusual.
00:01:55.294 - 00:02:23.890, Speaker A: So the culture is so digitally first that everything is very natural to basically go into sort of a cryptoculture as a result, pop in terms of hours spent online. But here's the opportunity. Asia represents about 54, actually more now percent of the world's global internet, which obviously is critical for people doing stuff on the web.
00:02:23.890 - 00:02:41.640, Speaker A: There's more than half of the world's gamers are in Asia at this moment in time, and it's growing rapidly. But in terms of adoption, still there's only 67%, so roughly two thirds of the sort of internet penetration in Asia. So this is in contrast to the US.
00:02:41.640 - 00:03:08.844, Speaker A: For instance, or Europe, which has almost full saturation. So you have a market that basically is already the biggest market when it comes to internet penetration and crypto adoption, but like in places like Vietnam, it's actually 70% of the nation. But when it comes to actual growth path, it's not just the fact that people are adopting crypto, it's also that people are experiencing basically the internet in a digital first culture and nature for the very first time because they're still being onboarded.
00:03:08.844 - 00:03:47.436, Speaker A: And one of the other areas of onboarding also comes from the fact that payment systems in Asia actually have a real good sort of crypto rail necessity because of the fact that there's a big portion of people in Asia that remain unbanked because they're basically not making that much money. Whether they're in the know, they get the stories know if you heard about Axie Infinity, many people signed up basically for crypto wallets over there to play the game, but they didn't have a bank account, they were technically unbanked, they didn't have any financial education, actually don't even have a bachelor's degree, never went to college. And here they are basically buying crypto and basically playing a blockchain play to earn game for example.
00:03:47.436 - 00:04:00.236, Speaker A: So that sort of represents that opportunity in places like Southeast Asia which continues to grow rapidly. And also in this year and the coming years, pretty much all of the global growth is going to come from the region. So this is a macro trend.
00:04:00.236 - 00:04:16.368, Speaker A: So it's not even just a specific crypto trend, it's a macro, macro trend. Asia is going to represent roughly 70% of global growth this year and continue to grow from that. So again, it's a market not to be ignored, but there's some other things that are relevant to think about which is also the regulatory climate.
00:04:16.368 - 00:04:38.460, Speaker A: Unlike there's been a lot of focus on looking what the US is doing. Obviously the Ripple case is good news for most people, but generally speaking, unlike the US, asia's regulatory climate for crypto and digital assets has become much clearer and much more friendlier. So for instance in Japan you can actually do a legal IEO that's approved by the JFSA which is a financial regulator.
00:04:38.460 - 00:04:51.820, Speaker A: You can actually do that through a proper process. It's probably the only country or one of the few countries in the world where you can do that outside of Singapore. Hong Kong has been very forward as well in terms of basically crypto regulation.
00:04:51.820 - 00:05:10.976, Speaker A: You can basically get exchange licenses, you will have clarity in terms of retail trading, which I'll go into some further details and I'll explain a little bit why that is the case. But even places like Japan have made Web Three and the Metaverse part of their national agenda. So you have a very friendly regulatory climate on top of friendly user adoption versus other markets.
00:05:10.976 - 00:05:19.364, Speaker A: So again, I urge people to take a look at that. So these are some of the major hotspots. I'll make this presentation available online so you can have to take notes.
00:05:19.364 - 00:05:34.508, Speaker A: But I think the one thing to note here is particularly for Hong Kong and the reason why I think Hong Kong is so valuable now is because it's not just about what Hong Kong does. It's really about China in some great ways, which I'll explain later. Hong Kong has now put together a Web Three task force.
00:05:34.508 - 00:05:49.664, Speaker A: That task force comprises of business leaders in the industry, including myself, as well as people from government whose main job is to basically push Web Three and metaverse development. In Hong Kong, there's also a marketing budget. It's about 50 million.
00:05:49.664 - 00:06:02.920, Speaker A: Hong Kong, it's about six or $7 million. So if you want to make an event, if you want to sort of promote stuff in Web Three, you can actually get money from the government to do that specifically for Web Three. Again, this is the other thing which is interesting.
00:06:02.920 - 00:06:21.116, Speaker A: It's probably the only regulator in the world that has sent a message to their banks and said you need to do business with crypto exchanges. So just imagine the US. Treasury doing something like that, sending a message to Citibank saying, hey, you got to do business with Coinbase and stuff, right? Not going to happen, probably.
00:06:21.116 - 00:06:48.040, Speaker A: But in Hong Kong, the HKMA basically went out and sent messages to basically bank of China HSBC and told them you need to basically support crypto businesses in Hong Kong. So again, at first the HKMA also issued, which is a monetary authority, also issued the first tokenized green bond. So just to demonstrate just how aggressively they're trying to push Web Three, meaning that if you still can't open a bank account wherever you are in the world as a crypto business, you can try Hong Kong.
00:06:48.040 - 00:07:09.016, Speaker A: Okay, so outside of licenses, there's crypto ETFs, you can actually buy Bitcoin ETFs basically at HSBC today, you have basically a retail trading framework. There's now 16 tokens that are available for retail trading in Hong Kong. More importantly though, there's a very clear way in which your tokens can trade in crypto.
00:07:09.016 - 00:07:32.084, Speaker A: So, unlike the lack of clarity that you might have in other places around the world, as long as the tokens are listed in two major indices, you can basically apply for essentially having the token be traded for retail trading in Hong Kong, for instance. And Hong Kong is the fifth or 6th largest financial sort of, I guess, center in the world. So again, we're not talking about sort a like a small place that's adopting this.
00:07:32.084 - 00:07:43.988, Speaker A: This is a major, major sort of area that's adopting this. So we think this in the next year, a lot of growth will happen from there. Now, why is this relevant? Well, Hong Kong has always been the financial intermediary for China.
00:07:43.988 - 00:08:16.656, Speaker A: In the same week when these rules came out and when retail trading was allowed in Hong Kong, which was in June, beijing released a white paper for basically Web Three innovation and development, which is basically a strategy paper on web three, which they actually specifically said that web three is the future of the Internet. So Beijing is putting quite a bit of capital and money in to promote, basically blockchain and Web three development, which is very confusing for a lot of people because people sort of conflated the issue of China as, oh, aren't they anti crypto and so on. We can maybe discuss this a little later.
00:08:16.656 - 00:09:00.636, Speaker A: But I think the other thing which is relevant is that for those who know about China, CCTV, which is the national broadcaster that every Chinese person sees in China, basically started talking on public TV in that same week how you can buy Bitcoin in. You know, what does it really mean? Well, I mean, I think one of the big trends here is about the fact that China is looking to promote, we think, this whole digital asset space, but through Hong Kong, in the same way that Hong Kong has always been the financial intermediary for China, for foreign sort of stock purchases, for foreign exchanges in terms of currencies and so on. So we also think that that becomes a mechanism where ultimately people from China will be able to sort of participate in the digital assets market, but through Hong Kong.
00:09:00.636 - 00:09:13.060, Speaker A: So that's, again, where we think a lot of the growth will happen. And of course, another big thing is that Apefest is coming to Hong Kong in November. So if you haven't made plans to come visit, go check it out, since we're going to talk about Apecoin very soon.
00:09:13.060 - 00:09:35.804, Speaker A: That's also the same time when we have basically Fintech Week, which is the week in which you have a lot of general sort of Web three activity happening in that time. So expect a pretty good time if you can make it out in Hong Kong places outside of talking to companies like us, you can go to invest Hong Kong, they'll give you support. Sometimes they pay for your tickets for you to come to Hong Kong to do stuff.
00:09:35.804 - 00:09:47.484, Speaker A: So again, they're trying to sort of help you come there. It's probably one of the most active governments right now that are trying to promote Web Three. So this is your opportunity to take advantage of if you're so interested.
00:09:47.484 - 00:10:02.596, Speaker A: And of course, there's accelerators in Hong Kong and so on. I won't go into the details of this, but again, if you want more information, I'm happy to share that later. Now, why is Asia so friendly to web three? I think this is important when we think about product market fit and about sort of philosophy a little bit.
00:10:02.596 - 00:10:22.244, Speaker A: So I'm talking about this here. In the context of Asia, this is an example of Korea, but the same is true for China, for Taiwan, for Southeast Asia about 40 or 50 years ago. South Korea, which you all know today because of BTS and Kpop and all that type of stuff, was actually a nation that was poorer than North Korea.
00:10:22.244 - 00:10:45.792, Speaker A: It was one of the poorest nations in the world. But today it has a GDP of probably the twelveTH or 13th largest country in the world. And why is that? Well, that story is the same story for most Asian countries during those decades because they adopted property rights, they embraced a form of, I guess, democratic principles and they basically went capitalist and that was a very big deal.
00:10:45.792 - 00:11:07.944, Speaker A: So in living memory, for instance, my parents generation, and for most let's call it Asian, call it Chinese or Korean people or Southeast Asian, our parents didn't have anything, they didn't own anything, they lost their property, they didn't have any rights whatsoever and they saw the benefits of capitalism. So even if there's inequity they actually generally are big believers in capitalism. They see it work.
00:11:07.944 - 00:11:20.376, Speaker A: It doesn't matter if this person makes more money than the other person. Broadly speaking, we do better. This is important to understand because that means the framework in Asia is they're pro capitalists, which is how we look at crypto is a kind of digital capitalism.
00:11:20.376 - 00:11:43.616, Speaker A: The other thing is, because of the last 30 or 40 years in Asia, there's been a lot of instability this has caused because of civil War, because of the Cold War, because of the Vietnam War, the Korean War. All these things have caused a lot of immigration from these places outside of the world to look for better pastures, but at the same time also a lack of security. So that means they're all looking for ways in which they can enhance their self sovereignty.
00:11:43.616 - 00:11:54.580, Speaker A: So one of them is to buy real estate overseas. That's a very classic, I guess, Chinese thing to do. But the other thing is also to have sort of other forms of self sovereignty which crypto starts to represent.
00:11:54.580 - 00:12:08.152, Speaker A: I can hold my own assets, self custody of my digital know, the government can't take it away. These things start to become very important and also payment rails that I can control as opposed to being gated. So again, that's another reason why crypto is so popular.
00:12:08.152 - 00:12:34.884, Speaker A: This is in stark contrast to what we see in places like the US. For instance, which over the last 30 years has moved away from this pro capitalist narrative which is still America, could still be called, I think, the center of capitalism. Except for in the recent study, I think it was a Pew study showed that Americans under the age of 30 majority started to skew socialist, whatever that might mean to them because capitalism hasn't worked for them.
00:12:34.884 - 00:12:45.352, Speaker A: And so we see this effect. So for instance, in Asia all major gaming companies are pro NFT, right? Whether it's Square enix, whether it's Krafton. The makers of PUBG nexon netmarble us.
00:12:45.352 - 00:12:50.200, Speaker A: Whatever. All these companies are all pushing NFTs and Web Three and digital ownership. Whereas in the US.
00:12:50.200 - 00:12:58.904, Speaker A: It's the opposite. Many of the gamers are rejecting it. And we think it doesn't come from a perspective of sort know what they all it's a very emotional response.
00:12:58.904 - 00:13:20.164, Speaker A: Their rejection on sort of crypto is more about a rejection on capitalism broadly, on the sort of idea that you can make money playing games. That seems wrong, and it seems wrong that someone should be able to sort of pay their way into it, which is very different from the Asian perspective. So the thing we sometimes say is that the American dream is more alive and well in Asia than it is in the US.
00:13:20.164 - 00:13:43.784, Speaker A: So I think it's again an area to look at for growth and opportunity. And I think the final thing I'll say about Asia before I start talking specifically about Apecoin is obviously there's an ecosystem there, you can raise money from it. There's very active VC investing, but also that influence that Asian, let's call it, I guess, capitalist sort of property rights narrative has spread through the Asian diaspora.
00:13:43.784 - 00:14:07.600, Speaker A: So we're in France, so the example here would be there's more overseas Chinese as in Chinese diaspora than there are French citizens in France. So it just gives you an idea of just the scale and size. And of course there's many more Indians and Japanese and Korean and they all sort of embody that same they all embody those same values and they communicate back with their sort of families back in their countries and so they create that bridge.
00:14:07.600 - 00:14:28.410, Speaker A: And it's therefore not a surprise that from a ratio, it is those same communities that also have a higher proportion of crypto ownership, or NFT ownerships, for instance. Asian Americans have a higher proportion of NFT ownership, for instance, in crypto ownership, than to, say, other groups as an example. And again, it comes back to sort of that cultural past that I just described before.
00:14:28.410 - 00:14:34.628, Speaker A: All right, so that's Asia. Pay attention in case you're interested. Now let's talk about DAOs.
00:14:34.628 - 00:14:50.288, Speaker A: I'm going to focus on Apecoin Dao, but I just wanted to illustrate why Dows are so relevant for this. It's not just maybe because you want to build a Dow, but also because Dows are funding avenues for your businesses. There's about 160 active Dows or so give or take, in web three.
00:14:50.288 - 00:15:06.384, Speaker A: And the collective amount of money that is under the community governance of these Dows is somewhere between twelve to $14 billion, which is very significant. So you could look at raising money for your business in a classic VC route. You can ask your mom and dad too, of course, or you can try a Dow.
00:15:06.384 - 00:15:27.092, Speaker A: And so I'm here to sort of give you a little bit of sort of insight as to, in the case of Apecoin Dow, how you could possibly raise money from them. And budgets have been approved in the millions of dollars, but also in the tens of thousands of dollars. And later on we'll hear about a prize of $10,000 worth that you can earn, but you could get so much more if you are able to sort of sort of appeal to the Apecoin Dow.
00:15:27.092 - 00:15:31.576, Speaker A: All right, so am I out of time? Oh, shoot. Damn. All right.
00:15:31.576 - 00:15:32.972, Speaker A: Okay. Got. Go faster.
00:15:32.972 - 00:15:38.352, Speaker A: So, working group structure. Basically you've got the special counsel. I will name them all out there.
00:15:38.352 - 00:15:49.012, Speaker A: The role of the Special Council is basically to vet essentially many of the proposals that come through. But maybe I won't talk too much about the governance and I spent too much time on Asia. But let me just explain to you maybe the process.
00:15:49.012 - 00:16:03.044, Speaker A: When you want to make a proposal, you basically submit an idea to the Dao. There is basically in discourse a proposal where you basically discuss it with the community that can be very active, which I encourage you to take a look at. That then enters into a draft stage.
00:16:03.044 - 00:16:15.544, Speaker A: The working group basically helps you with the drafting and then it basically goes to a vote in which Apecoin holders basically vote to basically get a proposal approved. I would say it's a little bit like political lobbying. These are the proposal categories.
00:16:15.544 - 00:16:21.992, Speaker A: You can go to basically Apecoin.com and learn more about it. There's multiple allocations and multiple sort of missions.
00:16:21.992 - 00:16:50.992, Speaker A: One of the things that is really important is when you go and apply for funding in this Dow, you have to ask them how does it benefit the Dao ecosystem? Now this, I think, is the one point that's not often discussed and not often written about, which is that if you want to basically get a vote passed, you do have to basically engage the community. You do have to basically not talk about just individuals but also address the delegates. And the delegates are the ones who are basically like your quasi super PACs, basically, of Apecoin.
00:16:50.992 - 00:17:07.916, Speaker A: And that something means you have to engage with them and talk to them. And essentially I see it as no different than you basically appealing to venture capitalists except in this case, you're going to different delegates and appealing to the end to communities to vote for your proposals. Okay, so I'll just skip through this.
00:17:07.916 - 00:17:24.460, Speaker A: This is an example of sort of something that was approved in the Apecoin Dow. This is basically thank Ape. So when you end up doing something in the Apecoin community, you get rewarded activities and you get rewarded in Apecoin to sort of increase engagement.
00:17:24.460 - 00:17:42.100, Speaker A: Here's something that's a little bit more tangible. It's an accelerator that was approved for half a million dollars in funding where if you were building something with Apecoin, you can basically get half a million. They were funded with money to basically fund an accelerator program that would basically support Apecoin projects or projects that utilize Apecoin, for instance.
00:17:42.100 - 00:17:56.556, Speaker A: And of course, we have a proposal that was also approved that basically allows Apecoin to be here at East Coil, for instance, for marketing and so forth. Yeah, so there's many ways to get involved at Apecoin dial. I know that I'm short on time, right? Yeah.
00:17:56.556 - 00:18:05.970, Speaker A: So we moved to Q and A. So I'm apologies for not sort of spending more time on Asia than on Apecoin, but maybe do you want to announce quickly the prize? Yes.
00:18:09.540 - 00:18:19.204, Speaker B: We're giving away $10,000 in prizes. There's two different categories, so one is the best use of Ape win and adapt. And so think about Ape as more like a consumer application.
00:18:19.204 - 00:18:35.032, Speaker B: I mean, you talked about Asian payments a lot. Like anything related to that, anything related to consumer games, in game currency, things like that. And then the second category is something that contributes to the ethereum ecosystem, but in a way that also benefits NFTs and the Apecoin community.
00:18:35.032 - 00:18:49.980, Speaker B: So think about that as like 6551 NFT ownership or account abstraction, four, three, seven, anything related to security, things like that. So each category gets $5,000. We're giving away $5,000 in each as you can apply to either.
00:18:49.980 - 00:19:01.676, Speaker B: And then just a little bit really quickly on just the technical stuff around Apecoin. So it's an ERC 20. There's a test token on girly in order to qualify for the prizes.
00:19:01.676 - 00:19:13.830, Speaker B: If you do use Apecoin, you can use it on polygon, you can use it on testnet, you don't have to deploy it on main nets. That's fine. Did I miss anything else? And that was it.
00:19:21.740 - 00:19:58.768, Speaker A: How do you keep the community engaged during a bear market? Because I've actually talked to a few Dows and the engagement is like all time low right now and there's like maybe 5% who are actually contributing, whereas the rest of them are just like writing GM once a day and that's well, thankfully, in the case of Apecoin, I would say that the community is quite active. We just finished our last special council election where I basically stepped down and we had a few new members, two new members join and we've had almost, I think it was 25 to 26 million sort of tokens voted, which is today's equivalent value of about 50 or at that time, $60 million. So it's still quite active.
00:19:58.768 - 00:20:17.688, Speaker A: Part of it has to do with the fact that I think Apecoin has become quite mature in terms of its working group structure. So when I gave you this example here, you can see that there's an actual sort of community structure which isn't just upheld by essentially a special council group, which you could almost consider like a leadership, which in the case of special counsel, it is not at all. But you have working group levels.
00:20:17.688 - 00:20:36.512, Speaker A: At these levels, you have different teams, the metaverse team and the treasury team, they're actually elected members. The way I think of a successful Dow is the more you create more democratic rails, as in you force people to say, look, I'm electing this person in this position to run in a certain way. They become campaigners of that as well.
00:20:36.512 - 00:20:46.116, Speaker A: So they engage the community. I think one of the problems that a lot of Dows have is they don't have actually that much, let's call it true distribution, shall we say. Right.
00:20:46.116 - 00:21:00.228, Speaker A: There's often criticisms that some of these Dows have sort of a few holders that can control the vote, for instance. Well, at that point it's not really a Dow. It may appear to be like a Dow, but it's actually not that different from, I guess some people call themselves democratic, but they're not truly democratic.
00:21:00.228 - 00:21:10.764, Speaker A: So I think it's the same thing and people become cynical. And I would say that for Apecoin, in the beginning people were cynical. But if you take a look at, for instance, the delegates here as an example, this is just the top.
00:21:10.764 - 00:21:20.864, Speaker A: That means there's a lot more and there's a lot more voting power. Even if you look at the special council last election, 25 million tokens were voted. The top delegate with Mochabers is about 1.7
00:21:20.864 - 00:21:30.160, Speaker A: million tokens. Yeah, sure, it's a big chunk, but it's still a very, very small chunk in comparison to swinging sort of that vote. So I think that is important.
00:21:30.160 - 00:21:47.128, Speaker A: So I think people feel like they have a voice. I think that's the most important thing, I think in any democratic structure, which in the case of a Dao would be the same. Finally, of course, it helps that you have a billion dollars of potential funding in a Dao, right? So if you want to raise money from the Dow, then there's a good incentive to do so.
00:21:47.128 - 00:22:02.808, Speaker A: And the community turns out to be quite careful. This criticism that, oh, you give this to you, if you don't give it to professionals, they're just going to go throw money at parties turns out to be all bullshit, which is what we thought anyway. Right? In fact, the community is very vigilant.
00:22:02.808 - 00:22:16.564, Speaker A: Proposals that are trying to raise money that are ridiculous never get approved, for instance. So it's just an example that actually sort of wisdom of the crowds does work very well when applied correctly. Okay, that's all we have time.
00:22:16.564 - 00:22:17.650, Speaker A: Thank you. Yat. Thank you.
