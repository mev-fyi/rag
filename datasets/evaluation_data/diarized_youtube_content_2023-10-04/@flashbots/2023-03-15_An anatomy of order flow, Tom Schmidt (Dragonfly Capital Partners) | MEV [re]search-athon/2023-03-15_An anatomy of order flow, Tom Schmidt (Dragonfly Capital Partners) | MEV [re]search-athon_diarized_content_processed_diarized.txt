00:00:02.810 - 00:00:06.574, Speaker A: Hi everyone, I'm Tom. I'm a GP at Dragonfly. We're a crypto venture fund.
00:00:06.612 - 00:00:08.606, Speaker B: We're early investors in class models and.
00:00:08.628 - 00:00:38.966, Speaker A: Today I'm going to be talking about order flow living in an MEB Dystopia specifically. I think the overview for this talk is I think there's been a lot of great presentations so far and there will be great presentations later about order flow design, oracle auction design, how to build auctions that have certain attributes that we like. I think this is obviously great research, but part of the problem I think is actually getting to a state where.
00:00:38.988 - 00:00:40.678, Speaker B: These auctions can actually be put in.
00:00:40.684 - 00:00:58.654, Speaker A: Place in the first place. So a lot of the designs that we talked about so far, frankly, mev related designs, sort of operate in this kind of environment and world that we live in right now, where, hey, there's going to be all these transactions hitting public mem pool and everyone's going to want to auction off their order flow. And how do we sort of design a great system around? That my point.
00:00:58.654 - 00:01:40.438, Speaker A: And sort of this point from this block, native Tweet is actually private order flow and private mempools are kind of becoming a bigger and bigger issue. So what's the point of a good option design if you don't actually have good inventory and good bidders? So what if we're wrong? What if there isn't actually sort of this nice public order flow that people might want to option off? How do we actually make sure that we can have sort of the world that we want in a way that doesn't sort of rely on finger wagging but actually just incentivizes people to kind of do the right thing? And this is also supposed to be more taxonomical. So sort of walking through examples of where order flow is going today, I think there's been a lot of great writing so far about theoretically how would you privatize order flow or theoretically what kind of service might exist.
00:01:40.438 - 00:02:03.218, Speaker A: So like Stefan or Quintess also a lot of great people wrote really great, don't really get research, sort of talking about this theoretical concept. But obviously as a VC I see a lot of different projects and a lot of different things that people are working on. And so my argument is that it's already happening and so it's not really good to think about, oh, in an abstract way, what would a block builder look like or hey, things should sort of work this way.
00:02:03.218 - 00:02:28.166, Speaker A: It's more how do things actually work and how do we get people to kind of build things that we think have a desirable endscape. So you might also be familiar with this mev supply chain sort of abstract that is sort of getting passed around in different circles. I think obviously this is great showing sort of order flow transaction flow going from user to wallet to searcher to builder to validator.
00:02:28.166 - 00:02:48.846, Speaker A: But I would argue this is almost sort of too simplistic. I think there's a lot of meat going on in here and I think it's probably worth sort of digging to what actually happens between user and the wallet because you get more and more leverage and more and more power as you sort of go further up the supply chain. So sort of high level overview, abstract sense of what happens in that transaction.
00:02:48.846 - 00:02:59.670, Speaker A: Lifecycle adapt UI somewhere. Abstractly sends a request for a signature for a transaction to a Web Three provider. The wallet requests a user to sign it.
00:02:59.670 - 00:03:14.330, Speaker A: You get one of these little nice pop ups and then user signs a transaction. The wallet in theory should send the signed transaction to an RPC endpoint, enters a public MEMP pool, enters a maybe boost relay, whatever. We sort of all know this bit and then it gets confirmed and then it does that UI updates.
00:03:14.330 - 00:03:42.050, Speaker A: So I think for each of these you can sort of see how each of these are different camps. They would sort of have the conception of, hey, we actually have the relationship with the end user or we actually have the order flow, right? So does the RTC endpoint actually have the order flow? That's how some people sort of think about it. Does the user, does the wallet, does the DAP? And I think each of these cases, each of these camps has actually really good argument as to why they actually have a lot of leverage and why they actually have sort of proprietary access to order flow.
00:03:42.050 - 00:03:56.470, Speaker A: And then we're going to just get a bunch of nice little memes out of the way. I got a fucking one of these, this one, this one. And understandably mad, I think in this scenario.
00:03:56.470 - 00:04:19.838, Speaker A: So I think, okay, let's put ourselves in the headspace of people who think of orderful. But we don't need to RPC providers, right? Because conceptually it's like transaction signed gets sent to some RPC and then they are still the ones that sort of determine where it gets routed intribately. It's easy to explain and I think this is historically how people have sort of thought about it.
00:04:19.838 - 00:04:38.930, Speaker A: But in practice, obviously there's a lot of hurdles to actually getting there, right? So who actually chooses the RPC provider? Can you even choose an RPC provider? Historically, up until very recently you couldn't actually select your Ethereum mainnet provider or RPC provider in MetaMask. You can only do it for new networks. So you kind of had to go within fura until I don't know, two or three months ago.
00:04:38.930 - 00:04:52.746, Speaker A: And even if someone does want to add a new network, the process of doing that is actually kind of a pain in the ass and kind of scary. This is actually from the Flashboss website on how to use Flashboss protect. It's like four steps and you're copy pasting a bunch of scary looking stuff.
00:04:52.746 - 00:05:19.290, Speaker A: It's actually really hard to get people to have agency over which RPC provider they're using and where their transactions are actually going. So the question is, even if you were able to say, hey, I want to get access to proprietary order flow via being an RTC provider, how do you actually get people to give you their order flow given all these sort of hurdles and that they might not even be able to understand how to. And so the go to market, I think, tends to sort of go into a few different buckets.
00:05:19.290 - 00:05:29.926, Speaker A: So one is sort of appealing to user security. So like, hey, send me your order flow, I want to make sure you're secure. This is stuff like Harpy again, disclosure Dragonfly port code, but I think they do some really cool stuff.
00:05:29.926 - 00:05:39.574, Speaker A: So you replace your RPC provider with Harpy's RPC. They intercept and scan every single transaction that you send them. If it looks potentially malicious, there's like sort of a two path process.
00:05:39.574 - 00:05:53.658, Speaker A: So they send you an email, you have to approve it, and then it actually gets sent into the public mem pool. And so you can see how, oh, this isn't just like faster, this isn't just like less resistant. It actually provides a very tangible user benefit to people, which sort of incentivizes them to sort of switch over.
00:05:53.658 - 00:06:16.662, Speaker A: I would say simulation tools are also sort of going down this path. So like a blowfish or like Estello or Alchemy also trying to think of, hey, what is like a real tangible user benefit that I can offer someone for giving me their order flow? Another sort of approach of go to market is sort of this ease of use idea. So this is stuff like Gas Hawk, I would say Flashbust protect one inch rabbit holes, your transaction API, which just came out.
00:06:16.662 - 00:06:33.378, Speaker A: It's basically adding a lot of nice, just pure UX benefits to sending them your transaction. Like with Gas Knock, they will basically hold onto your transaction until gas prices come down based on some modeling that they do. So you can pay less than you would if you just send it off into the MEMP pool immediately.
00:06:33.378 - 00:06:44.954, Speaker A: They can use managed transactions so you can pay with a different fee. You can make sure you're not paying for any sales transactions, just like really nice sort of UX upgrades. In concept, these all should be like no brainers to adopt.
00:06:44.954 - 00:07:09.774, Speaker A: Why would you send your transactions to Infira today when you could send them to any of these nice services and they sort of give you all these nice benefits on top of it? But in practice, obviously, it's not really happening there. And I think that's in part because the idea of RPC provider is very abstract and kind of difficult to grock and many wallets don't even really expose this idea. And so instead, what you see a lot of RPC providers do is sell directly to wallets.
00:07:09.774 - 00:07:25.034, Speaker A: So it's kind of like manifold and colorheads where the idea is basically hey, you're a wallet, you're trying to make money. You're venture back and your VCs are telling you to make money. Okay, what are you going to do? Well you could add a MetaMask swap type feature but maybe you're not big enough or you're not the right kind of user base to monetize that.
00:07:25.034 - 00:07:45.070, Speaker A: Could you actually go about basically using these products as mev extraction as a service and so they get proprietary access to your order flow. As a wallet they extract mev from all the flows the other users are generating and that's how you actually make money. And again, this isn't even a concept like these kinds of things today.
00:07:45.070 - 00:08:14.758, Speaker A: I would say the other sort of fork in this path is stuff of hey, give me your order flow and obviously give you a kickback directly as a user. Nectar is working on this kind of concept but the idea is basically instead of giving you some sort of UX win, I will actually extract as much mev as I can from your order flow and then either give it back to the wallet or give it back to the user. So this is kind of why people think oh, if I'm an RPC provider I can get all this proprietary order flow and that's going to be kind of like my moat or kind of how this market is going to shake down.
00:08:14.758 - 00:08:35.514, Speaker A: But in practice if you sort of go one level up the stack and one level up the funnel, wallets actually have way more leverage here, right? Because again, as you sort of discussed, they can prevent you from switching your RPC or they can sort of have a really powerful default or they can sort of abstract out or hide all this sort of stuff. So wallets they need to monetize, not everyone can have a MetaMask swap type product. They also tend to have really premium order flow.
00:08:35.514 - 00:08:54.758, Speaker A: We sort of think about order flow again in a very abstract sense. But order flow from retail users who are not price sensitive, not time sensitive, is way more valuable than order flow from a arbitrage bot or something or like a very sophisticated trader who's going to give you a lot of toxic flow. And so wallets actually have this nice sort of juicy premium, again sort of Robin Hood like in that way.
00:08:54.758 - 00:09:05.254, Speaker A: Again also many wallets do not allow users to switch RPC or they obfuscate out the RPC provider. This is actually from MetaMask, from MetaMask swaps. They have this demo future of what they call smart transactions.
00:09:05.254 - 00:09:23.470, Speaker A: Basically they do a lot of the things that the RPC providers that I just sort of went over do for you instead of just sending your transactions directly to the mempool. So minimize toss, minimize front know, they prevent you from paying for failed transactions, things like that. So again it's like even removing sort of the possibility for choice.
00:09:23.470 - 00:09:42.418, Speaker A: And these wee wallets obviously they can do it themselves. It's a nice little Bert and Miller tweet over here. So Rainbow obviously for a while they switched into doing swaps more recently was like back running user trades and that was sort of nice monetization path for them or they can just offload it to a partner like Manifold.
00:09:42.418 - 00:10:02.700, Speaker A: Or in theory again, sort of the mental model with operating is like oh, they should just auction off the flow. The question is, how do you actually incentivize them to do that when in reality they might be making more money doing these other things. So it might actually be more profitable just to have a swap feature rather than trying to sort of make money by auctioning off flow or extracting med from flow yourself.
00:10:02.700 - 00:10:30.006, Speaker A: It is also kind of presupposes that wallets are responsible for receiving and sending a transaction, which is not always the case as example by sort of intent based transactions or app specific transactions. So that's sort of the last bit here, which is like in reality if you sort of go all the way up the funnel, it's sort of the interface and DAP UI that actually kicks off the transaction that argue has kind of the most leverage. And we already are starting to see this as well.
00:10:30.006 - 00:10:50.234, Speaker A: So right now you think about, okay, this app sends transaction requests and then they're sort of out of loop until the transaction actually gets confirmed. But in reality they don't need to have the wallet sign and broadcast the transaction, they can just hold onto the transaction themselves or they can sort of have an app specific transaction and send it themselves to their own relay. So this is exactly actually what Sushi does.
00:10:50.234 - 00:11:13.006, Speaker A: They have a partnership with Manifold and when you go to Sushi, you can use this Sushi guard feature. You basically sign this sort of off chain order and then it goes into their proprietary RPC provider and then their own little private pool. So it's like even if you were a wallet here, you wouldn't even have any leverage because you're not actually signing transaction, you're signing this sort of app specific order, app specific transaction.
00:11:13.006 - 00:11:26.150, Speaker A: So it's like everyone's sort of going up and up further up the stack and trying to pre up the person in front of them. Obviously this one's also somewhat confusing and dangerous because you're having someone sign this hex string and it's kind of spooky. So maybe not the best outcome.
00:11:26.150 - 00:11:43.014, Speaker A: Also, again, this sort of really heavily depends on you as an application and your UI. A lot of applications, a lot of the flow is coming from aggregators, it's coming from third party UI, it's coming from bots. But for other applications such as Uniswap, a lot of the flow is actually coming from their own UI.
00:11:43.014 - 00:11:56.606, Speaker A: So they have a lot of leverage when it comes to transaction generation and whatnot. So this is like looking at percentage toxic flow. You can look at sort of the user base and where flows are breaking down for these different applications, but it's not sort of one to one.
00:11:56.606 - 00:12:19.606, Speaker A: So you can't sort of apply this ad hoc to your specific apps. And then there's sort of this question sort of going back to the other RPC providers of how do you then incentivize people to use your own proprietary UI versus coming in through a third party? Maybe this sort of goes back to this idea of kickbacks and rep share but instead of going back to the app, they're actually going back to users. And then yeah, I swear I actually made these before the uniswap thing.
00:12:19.606 - 00:12:54.286, Speaker A: But maybe the answer is actually just do more vertical integration and make your own wallet if you're a DAP and now you don't have to worry about any of this sort of like these adversaries potentially intersecting your flow. So I think the purpose of this was basically to say everyone is sort of acting very rationally, right? Everyone is thinking about how do I make money and also provide a really good user experience. I think even in Talk know, Google and digital auctions overall, it's like we didn't get into this end state by someone being malicious or evil.
00:12:54.286 - 00:13:32.474, Speaker A: It was literally just like how do I provide a really great experience? And inherently a lot of that comes from sort of vertical integration and that vertical integration creates sort of centralization. And so the question is how do we not get mad at MetaMask for having their own private RPC? How do we not get mad at an RPC provider for having a sort of private order flow process? It's like how do we actually achieve their own objectives, which is to make money, but also in a way that has a sort of open private ecosystem that we actually want to create. So I think you can call these comments and you can be kind of mad at them, but I don't think that's really kind of the best outcome.
00:13:32.474 - 00:14:01.390, Speaker A: The question is how do you actually get them to intentionally and by their own volition open up their order flow? So how do we make the plus EV? It's basically a question of how do you make it more profitable for them to auction off their float versus extracting it themselves and what that sort of delta is. I think the other question that's sort of yet to be seen is how users play into this. Right now there are very few products that are actually offering kickbacks to users.
00:14:01.390 - 00:14:27.266, Speaker A: A lot of the sort of perceived benefit from using one of these things is like in better execution or cost savings or something like that, but it's not really tangible. People always like seeing a cash balance versus being told to get better execution. So I think there will be more competition between these different sort of layers of the stack to ideally push more of this value back to users, but it also kind of depends on again how the stack forms and who's going to integrate and all that kind of stuff.
00:14:27.266 - 00:14:50.674, Speaker A: And the last bit here is we need better data. I think have a few sort of what snippets of different snapshots of different parts of the stack in this deck, but we don't actually have really good visibility into private mem pools today and where orders are actually getting sent before they end up on chain. There's always sort of very vague, like 70% of orders are going through infira stack, which is like wrong, but it's a very outdated stat.
00:14:50.674 - 00:15:01.120, Speaker A: So if you're interested in exploring some more data around private mempools and private order flow DM me, email me. I'm working on some research right now. So yeah, that's it.
00:15:02.850 - 00:15:20.898, Speaker C: So recap when you're talking about UIs having control of order flow, you are basically saying that happens only by signing non transactions with these specific IDW 712, whatever encrypted messages and then that gets passed on someone else.
00:15:21.064 - 00:15:36.354, Speaker A: So there's multiple ways to do it. That is one way to do it right is you sign sort of a specific order for your thing or if it's sushi zero x or whatever in openc. Another way to do it right is you can just have someone sign a transaction and you get the hash back, but you don't have the wallet broadcast.
00:15:36.354 - 00:16:04.034, Speaker A: So there's like different functions within Web Three for Ethers for just signing transaction. It doesn't work with MetaMask because they don't allow you to do that. But in concept exists, right, for other Web Three providers? No, that was a block native screenshot, but that was like three months ago, so I haven't seen their latest data.
00:16:04.232 - 00:16:15.640, Speaker B: Oh shit, check it out. Send you a link. Someone calling Tarun to get him to ask his question.
00:16:17.770 - 00:16:25.800, Speaker D: I think Tarun had to catch a slide. I'm going to point to someone to ask him a question.
00:16:26.730 - 00:16:33.720, Speaker A: Dan? Yeah, it seems to me like there's like.
00:16:35.770 - 00:16:51.918, Speaker B: Twelve laps now and there's probably going to be like 20 next week, 40 the week after. Do you have thoughts on how we could create an auction for order flow? Or is proliferation of should we incentivize as many as possible?
00:16:52.084 - 00:17:23.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw Stefan had a post recently on the different sort of like ofa I think it was great. Right? I think my point is like I don't really doubt that we can design a nice sort of like privacy preserving, value maximizing order flow auction. The question is how do we prevent a world where actually MetaMask has like 80% of the retail flow and they don't actually want to engage in an auction because it's more profitable for them to just extract it themselves or extract it you want to pay permission third party versus actually opening up into an auction.
00:17:23.574 - 00:17:35.600, Speaker A: And so I think that is almost more the thing I would like to measure and think about maximizing is the delta between self extraction or third party extraction versus true revenue from an auction or something like that.
00:17:38.700 - 00:17:51.320, Speaker B: So what kind of strategy getting the boards to go up to max? 38% of it very hard to make use of banker.
00:17:51.840 - 00:18:22.500, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I am kind of bullish on these more sort of direct to consumer plays of specifically sort of giving users like a kickback from their mev, right? So far most of the order flow proceeds either go back to the DAP, like the Sushi, or they go back to the WA of the rainbow. But basically no one is actually giving users kickback or the kickbacks into something like a very abstract way or price execution. And so I think if it becomes more normalized for users to expect something like that, then it sort of creates quite competitive pressure in the market.
00:18:22.500 - 00:18:47.870, Speaker A: I think you see that a little bit in something, say like hotel points or like credit card rewards right, where it's like these things shouldn't exist and they're actually like kind of operations or inefficient. But the overall idea is basically to create competitive pressure on providers to give this sort of perceived consumer surplus. So I think that's kind of the area that might be interesting versus again, relying on these providers to do the right thing.
00:18:48.800 - 00:18:55.330, Speaker B: This might be some born questions, but talk a little bit more about privacy, private men pool and.
00:18:57.460 - 00:18:58.850, Speaker C: Is there any data?
00:19:00.340 - 00:19:17.976, Speaker A: Yes. So I published a block in the Tweet. Basically the heuristic is well, if we look at transactions that are confirmed, but we're not seen in any mem pool prior to being confirmed and probably went through some sort of private relay, right? Like if I send it directly to a minor or whatever.
00:19:17.976 - 00:19:47.616, Speaker A: And so the question is like, well, okay, can we keep measuring that on a regular basis so we can track the size of these private mem pools and then can we do further breakdown within there to see like, okay, what types of transactions are going through private relays and where those are from? So I'm looking forward to seeing this data, but I feel like that's actually kind of like it reminds me a little bit of pre mev explorer people are like, oh, mev is like an issue, how can I actually map it and track this? And so this feels very similar to me in that it's actually kind of a big growing problem and we need.
00:19:47.638 - 00:19:59.510, Speaker B: To make sure we're up to impact abstraction that eventually transactions go to zero. All the transactions go through MetaMask. Right.
00:19:59.510 - 00:20:06.132, Speaker B: I'll pay the gas fees. Our free wallets applications they'll pay.
00:20:06.266 - 00:20:21.464, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this is sort of this idea that, oh, actually the person bidding on your flow is like the one going to be paying the fees. Yeah, I think maybe that sort of goes back to this creating expectation around users of getting referrals or getting PayPal.
00:20:21.512 - 00:20:21.676, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:21.698 - 00:20:31.536, Speaker A: Where it's like that inherently creates competitive pressure on providers to offer that to them versus not having that sort of norm, even if it's maybe less efficient than what it should be.
00:20:31.718 - 00:20:40.176, Speaker B: I think there are a lot of actions in DeFi space. Well, pretty much any transaction, right? You have no guarantees on the actual value of your transaction.
00:20:40.208 - 00:20:40.404, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:40.442 - 00:20:51.152, Speaker B: You have an intrinsic value that you prescribe that transaction, but that doesn't mean it can be externalized to the order flow provider.
00:20:51.216 - 00:20:51.830, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:53.180 - 00:21:03.528, Speaker B: And so I imagine for things like swaps, that's a very easy value calculation. There are a lot of other things where fundamentally can you be paying full price?
00:21:03.614 - 00:21:04.250, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:06.320 - 00:21:36.544, Speaker B: Feels like the dynamic in a lot of these mev infrastructure projects or auctions is to kind of push the MEB value from the middle to either the user or the validator. So I would like to understand, what do you think the sustainability for projects like Blockchain rely on the searchers PNL share? So like, if you kind of competing over 39.9% for the user or the validator kind of revenue actually, for these kind of projects.
00:21:36.592 - 00:21:49.400, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it's like a new trend though, right? Like search and margin have been compressing kind of forever. I think for these services too, it's not so much about I don't know, certainly they have surface of customers, but they have a lot of other customers too.
00:21:49.400 - 00:22:13.792, Speaker A: More sassy and different that way people would prefer me. Again, I think that the credit card example is app, right, where it's like we're in a really stupid sort of equilibrium right now with sort of points. This is obviously just like a tax and dragon system, but it's a very tangible thing people like and feel, and we shouldn't really discount that.
00:22:13.792 - 00:22:24.100, Speaker A: So obviously people like it's better to have better, it's more efficient, more gas. But how do you actually feel that and see that? And how do you put a meme around it and it's just not as.
00:22:24.170 - 00:22:27.590, Speaker B: Sort of tangible, I guess. So that's kind of my thinking on it.
00:22:28.840 - 00:22:36.520, Speaker A: Yes, the US specifically is a really weird thing, but again, it shouldn't exist, but it does and that's the outcome.
00:22:38.220 - 00:22:38.970, Speaker B: What?
00:22:39.340 - 00:22:45.420, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. No one's going to use a credit card that has given them points, right? Like, what the fuck?
00:22:46.880 - 00:22:50.510, Speaker B: People love that. Yeah.
00:22:52.240 - 00:22:54.830, Speaker D: Question. Oh, you go.
00:22:55.360 - 00:23:08.652, Speaker B: Just like a crazy edge case. Like, if the med from a user transaction, like far exceeds the fee, is it possible there's a world where wallets are kind of like extracting possible transactions from users?
00:23:08.796 - 00:23:13.892, Speaker A: Like have them sign a transaction just so you can extract me from it? Yeah, I didn't say I thought about that.
00:23:13.946 - 00:23:14.550, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:19.720 - 00:23:39.192, Speaker A: I haven't thought about that. But that's interesting. I think the Gas Hawk thing is maybe a little bit in a sand of, like, Gas Hawk also not necessarily kind of cool, but basically it's like you are if you capturing the value from your lower time preference.
00:23:39.192 - 00:23:42.668, Speaker A: And maybe they would be willing to pay you to delay your transaction so.
00:23:42.674 - 00:23:44.620, Speaker B: They can sort of capture more of that spread.
00:23:46.160 - 00:23:47.696, Speaker C: What do you think about MetaMask and.
00:23:47.718 - 00:23:51.280, Speaker B: Other wallets basically refusing to add APIs for signing?
00:23:54.580 - 00:23:58.684, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. I mean, it was sort of like the CP thing. It's goofy.
00:23:58.684 - 00:24:10.820, Speaker A: I don't really know the reasons why, honestly, because obviously it's like a native function in web three and ethers and yet it's just kind of almost intentionally broken. So I don't really know the rationale.
00:24:15.370 - 00:24:16.950, Speaker B: It's for non Spanish.
00:24:20.170 - 00:24:25.260, Speaker A: Yeah, you could fix that. Okay, cool.
00:24:30.030 - 00:24:30.940, Speaker C: We've all.
00:24:39.030 - 00:24:43.700, Speaker D: So I was going to ask the thought leader in this room.
00:24:45.910 - 00:24:52.098, Speaker B: Why do you think about this in terms of me Dkfx at all? Rather than just we're trying to get users this is almost all tax volume, right?
00:24:52.184 - 00:24:52.578, Speaker A: Yes.
00:24:52.664 - 00:24:55.410, Speaker B: So why isn't just we're just trying to get users the best price?
00:24:55.560 - 00:25:24.558, Speaker A: So I was back to kind of what I was saying earlier, which is like, it's too abstract and not tangible a value for people to really appreciate it. People like seeing money in accounts that they can point to and maybe we can actually present that in terms of savings, in terms of best execution. But I think relying on my point is, yes, all different providers here are acting in their own interests, but really the user at the end of the.
00:25:24.564 - 00:25:26.826, Speaker B: Day has sort of market power, investing.
00:25:26.858 - 00:25:30.790, Speaker A: Power, and so it's like, how do you incentivize them to apply that pressure.
00:25:30.810 - 00:25:36.050, Speaker B: On their given provider? So we should just give users like really shitty prices and huge kickbacks?
00:25:37.430 - 00:25:38.706, Speaker A: That would be one way to do it.
00:25:38.728 - 00:25:45.220, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:25:52.950 - 00:26:18.350, Speaker C: If you look at the swap game, you can think of games with better prices or rebates, they're sort of interchangeable, but in different kinds of games, the user outcome could be relatively fixed. Example is a Oracle update. The execution of the update might just be fixed and there's no notion of a better outcome with the execution, but there's a rebate.
00:26:18.350 - 00:26:35.254, Speaker C: There's a limit on what you can do with the output, but you can maybe paste on it. In general, there might be games where the action of one agent increases the welfare of many other agents and everyone's paper, even though the action itself and the potential outcomes of those actions don't actually do that much.
00:26:35.292 - 00:26:44.890, Speaker B: Really. That's a good example. I do think there's probably some long tail MEB created by usernames, but they're not submitting Oracle updates through a wallet or whatever.
00:26:44.960 - 00:26:46.540, Speaker A: Right, yeah.
00:26:48.350 - 00:26:54.906, Speaker B: When users are creating mev. I think the two examples I've heard are like, it's Dex trades and NFT backed in your sense.
00:26:55.088 - 00:26:56.614, Speaker A: Those are also the vast majority.
00:26:56.662 - 00:26:56.934, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:56.992 - 00:26:58.720, Speaker A: I don't want to focus on prediction because.
00:27:00.610 - 00:27:02.960, Speaker B: There is some non zero sum. I agree.
00:27:05.010 - 00:27:16.740, Speaker C: The question is also do you think about where the value is today, which is a lot of swaps or. Where are they going to be in 10, 15, 20 years? Maybe it's gold swaps. Maybe it's something that could be different.
00:27:18.310 - 00:27:34.040, Speaker D: Okay, so I'll finish asking my question for the Sole Peters. So of the various school of order code providers, who's going to win and what are the unknown factors or what would like to know?
00:27:34.970 - 00:27:36.680, Speaker B: I think the user is going to win.
00:27:37.690 - 00:27:39.654, Speaker D: Users not count. I'm a service provider.
00:27:39.702 - 00:27:40.300, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:27:41.070 - 00:27:42.858, Speaker C: No, I think basically it's going to.
00:27:42.864 - 00:27:59.950, Speaker B: Be so competitive to provide better execution for users that the vast majority is going to end up going. Certainly a tax mev I think is going to go into user better user execution. And it does like that's what happened in traditional finance, which seems kind of dystopian when you look at all everything, but turns out with just a retail you just get like sub penny spreads.
00:28:00.610 - 00:28:01.866, Speaker D: Why Dex mev?
00:28:01.898 - 00:28:08.820, Speaker B: Only right now Dex is most MVP and I think most user created will probably be.
00:28:14.310 - 00:28:16.710, Speaker D: What about Tom thought leader?
00:28:17.290 - 00:28:35.654, Speaker A: Well, I think again, in the sort of spirit of moving further up the supply chain and having more leverage. I agree users have a lot of leverage, but it's more about maybe helping them recognize it or actually use it. Right now, even if you're a user, you don't have that much agency in terms of redirecting your order flow.
00:28:35.654 - 00:28:46.990, Speaker A: Don't even sort of think about it. So I think that's kind of more what everybody's thinking about is just like sort of creating competitive markets and dynamics and instead of just like again, finger wagging.
00:28:49.570 - 00:28:50.270, Speaker B: Next question.
00:28:50.340 - 00:28:50.960, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:55.170 - 00:28:56.240, Speaker B: Don'T want.
00:28:58.470 - 00:29:03.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I would argue virtual integration when MetaMask swaps is actually.
00:29:03.368 - 00:29:04.946, Speaker B: Like a perfect example, right, where it's.
00:29:04.978 - 00:29:18.822, Speaker A: Like it is the UI and it is the wallet and it is the RPC provider. They have their own proprietary private RPC Pins. And so it's like if you get mad at any individual actor there, it's pointless because it's all being critically integrated.
00:29:18.822 - 00:29:25.994, Speaker A: And so really the question is how do you sort of change transaction provenance and create pressure to not do this?
00:29:26.032 - 00:29:29.130, Speaker B: And that comes from users and market selection.
00:29:30.030 - 00:29:35.482, Speaker C: I was just asking if you think the alpha is like knowing the order.
00:29:35.536 - 00:29:37.862, Speaker B: Flow or executing the order flow.
00:29:38.006 - 00:29:40.942, Speaker A: Like it's it's in it's in knowing.
00:29:41.086 - 00:29:43.182, Speaker B: You have less competition in execution.
00:29:43.326 - 00:29:57.282, Speaker A: So like, you know, it's kind of the point, right? It is like right now the order flow is public and that's why you have like searchers but like in a world where the order flow is not public, then you sort of have complete.
00:29:57.336 - 00:29:59.520, Speaker B: Discretion and that's kind of like where the audit is.
