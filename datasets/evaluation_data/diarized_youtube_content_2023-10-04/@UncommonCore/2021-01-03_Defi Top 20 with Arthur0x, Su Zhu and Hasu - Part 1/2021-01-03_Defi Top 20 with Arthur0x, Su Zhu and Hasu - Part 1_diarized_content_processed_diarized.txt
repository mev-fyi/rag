00:00:00.410 - 00:00:27.398, Speaker A: Welcome to Uncommon Core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. After our video on the top 20 crypto coins by market cap that was very popular, we got a lot of requests to do one on DFI decentralized finance, which mainly exists on Ethereum. And for that episode, we have brought the foremost expert on DeFi there is.
00:00:27.398 - 00:00:37.586, Speaker A: At least he was one of the very first and most successful DeFi investors who knows a lot of things about it, knows every protocol. So welcome Arthur.
00:00:37.698 - 00:00:39.942, Speaker B: Hey. Hi. Hasu and sue.
00:00:39.942 - 00:00:42.026, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Yeah, great to be here. Yeah.
00:00:42.048 - 00:01:14.674, Speaker C: And just to introduce Arthur a bit further, he's kind of gone from being one of the earliest adopters of synthetics and Aave, as well as Kyber, to being now running the largest DeFi focused fund in all of Asia, which is Defiance Capital, which I've had the pleasure of supporting from the early days. And it's been quite impressive to see their growth. So, without further ado, let's get into it.
00:01:14.674 - 00:01:20.726, Speaker C: We've got a list of the top 20 DFI coins in front of me.
00:01:20.908 - 00:01:38.314, Speaker A: Last time we went, just an audit list by market cap. This time we are taking a little bit of a different approach just because so many projects in DFI try to solve similar problems to each other. And we actually grouped them by six different categories and we'll talk about them one by one.
00:01:38.314 - 00:01:53.760, Speaker A: So we have the Dex category, decentralized exchanges, then we have spot lending, synthetics lending, bridges and then the other two you'll see when we get there. So yeah, let's start.
00:01:56.690 - 00:02:17.122, Speaker B: So I think we start from uniswap. Uniswap is probably one of, if not the most successful decentralized exchange right now, both by the trading volume and by the active user. So on average it's due around 200 to 300 million volume and have around 20,000 daily users.
00:02:17.122 - 00:02:54.526, Speaker B: And it's also the first one to popularize the automated market maker model to provide liquidity for exchanges, which is you can say that it changed the decentralized exchange landscape because without it, it is very expensive and difficult to trade on decentralized. So this is what Uniswap is about. And the interesting thing is Uniswap was launched using the grant from the Ethereum Foundation to the founder Hayden and he was a former mechanical engineer and started this as I think, more of like a hobby project.
00:02:54.526 - 00:03:39.106, Speaker B: So I think my view is definitely the most successful decks right now, as you can see from the user volume and user and the volume, and I think it did change the entire landscape and I think bring a lot of wealth effect into the entire DeFi space through their retroactive distributions. Although there was a lot of criticism on the AMA model that brings impermanent loss to the liquidity provider, which also can consider as a market maker in a traditional context. But despite this, I think that people realize that the fee in some situation can actually offset the impermanent losses, although I don't really like this term, but this is what people call it.
00:03:39.106 - 00:04:15.722, Speaker B: So right now you still have around $2 billion of liquidity locked inside Unisop to provide liquidity for various tradings. So I think that the next move is really for them to innovate from this because right now the model is inefficient for the popular mainstream asset because the slippage is way too high given the capital it has that is under locked up. So especially, let's say you talk to a professional market maker with that amount of capital, they can definitely provide a much tighter pricing compared to Unison.
00:04:15.722 - 00:04:32.354, Speaker B: So I think that the VTree is supposedly have a lot of new innovation that can mitigate part of this impermanent loss issue. And there has been a lot of engineering and research work in the work. They have been very secretive about that, but it's supposedly to be very good.
00:04:32.354 - 00:04:53.578, Speaker B: And they have the backing of one of the most biggest crypto venture fund in the space paradigm, which has a lot of the top researcher in the space to help them on that as well. Everyone in the DeFi space is definitely looking forward to this and see how innovative the Unisoft V Three will be. And I think that's really a key event to watch right now.
00:04:53.578 - 00:05:07.886, Speaker B: I think one of the key issue is the governance issue. I think that the 40 million threshold is too high and everyone agree, I think most people agree with that. And I think the previous governance proposal to lower the threshold didn't go through.
00:05:07.886 - 00:05:21.298, Speaker B: And the team seems to be taking a pretty hands off approach to this governance. They can't just say that we will let community decide anything, that we are not going to drive this. And I think probably partly due to the legal reasons since they're based in US.
00:05:21.298 - 00:05:29.590, Speaker B: But I think that this debt lot is slowing down the progress on the community side quite a fair bit. Yeah, that's probably the general view.
00:05:29.740 - 00:06:02.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the governance thing is the governance problems are very real. It seemed almost like they didn't want the community to have any say in what they're doing yet, probably because they have a very concrete vision for what the Uniswap V Three is supposed to do and they don't really want anyone meddling with that. And so they launched the token and the governance in a way that it would be paralyzed at least until V Three is out, and then maybe do more of a handoff to the community.
00:06:03.030 - 00:06:28.540, Speaker C: Kind of interesting. Also the governance proposals were focused on giving Dharma and some of the Arjun and some of the smart wallets that aggregate a lot of small users together and then interact with Uniswap themselves. They kind of fought hard to get their own to try to get their piece of the AirDrop for the users right.
00:06:28.540 - 00:07:09.010, Speaker C: And that ended up not happening, or not passing rather. But I think one thing interesting with these kind of equityairdrop emission coins is that you get really three different distinct token holders, right? You get some that are focused on trying to get more governance power, you have others that are trying to maintain their power and then you have yet others that are trying to make sure that they keep getting rewards. The LPs.
00:07:09.010 - 00:07:36.640, Speaker C: Basically. So I think Uniswap being the first and sort of being the biggest, these are the toughest questions in my opinion, in DeFi, which is how do you reconcile these three very different forces? How do they align on the vision? And then governance doesn't stall, right? Because in theory you could have these retrospectives get pushed forever. It could come up again in a few months, right? It can never end in that sense.
00:07:40.610 - 00:07:57.894, Speaker A: Moving on to SushiSwap. So, SushiSwap forked from a Uniswap basically, and had one major change, which was to add a governance token before Uni was out. So, as I understand, you guys both like SushiSwap a lot.
00:07:57.894 - 00:08:06.790, Speaker A: So let's hear why you think this is a distinguished project from Uniswap that deserves our attention.
00:08:08.010 - 00:08:31.534, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think I'll probably start with this. So I think SushiSwap is definitely a very interesting one for me personally, because I was pretty against it when it was launched, because I think it's pretty distasteful. And the way that the initial founder, Chef Normie, was obviously I don't think it was launched with a good intention to return the reward to community.
00:08:31.534 - 00:08:44.482, Speaker B: I think that's part of the intention. But another part of the intention is really just to be a founder of another successful DeFi fork and make a lot of money in the process. Although he did return the money in the end.
00:08:44.482 - 00:08:56.230, Speaker B: But I think that there was always part of the intention. That the so called profit maximalist mantra and I think there was no innovation. It's purely like launching a token ahead of Uniswap.
00:08:56.230 - 00:09:19.306, Speaker B: And I also think that initially the Staking contract they used for the liquidity mining was also they are not using the existing one, which is the one that was used by synthetics. That was the one that's most commonly used by other footcoin DeFi fork, but they actually used their own Staking contract and there was not audited. So I didn't feel that safe.
00:09:19.306 - 00:09:38.870, Speaker B: So as a result, I didn't really interact with Sushisok much at the peak of the liquidity mining of Sushisok. So that was actually how it got started. And at that time there's really no much innovation because it's just copying the Unixoft feature and add a token on top of it.
00:09:38.870 - 00:10:15.554, Speaker B: I don't see how a fork without any unique selling point can sustain in the future. But what changed my mind is at the bottom of the DeFi correction, when some of the better coin have rebound from the bottom, I start looking for undervalued stuff and I realized that actually, to my surprise, sushisop is still doing a very decent volume despite the over of the hype. At that point of time, there's almost nobody talking about it in social media, and nobody even knows what is happening to sushisoft at that point.
00:10:15.554 - 00:10:38.098, Speaker B: But it's still among the top five decentralized exchange by volume and also by user as well. So despite all this drama, it still retain a core community of user and also volume as well. And they already implemented the value capture, which is like five basis point of all the volume will go to the fee pool.
00:10:38.098 - 00:10:57.246, Speaker B: They will be distributed to the sushi staker, and over the last two months, it averaged around ten to 20% of annualized yield. And this yield is a real you, because actually they do get the cash flow and use that cash flow to purchase more sushi from the open market to distribute it to the sushi staker. So it's not like an inflation driven you.
00:10:57.246 - 00:11:15.070, Speaker B: I mean, they do have inflation, but that is to pay the liquidity mining reward. But actually, over the last two months, the liquidity mining reward have decreased significantly, and two thirds of the reward are actually locked up. And despite this, there's still a pretty sticky bunch of liquidity.
00:11:15.070 - 00:11:29.142, Speaker B: Even at the bottom, he has around $200 million worth of liquidity, and right now, I think he has around 1.2 billion worth of liquidity and with the same reduced emission schedule. So I think that that is what surprised me and made me to do more research.
00:11:29.142 - 00:11:48.506, Speaker B: So after I start the research process, I start to learn more about SushiSwap. It turned out that they did manage to attract a core group, a contributor, to keep contributing, and they are not even in the official team like the boring crypto, that's his nickname. And he was on a contractual role.
00:11:48.506 - 00:12:04.242, Speaker B: He take a certain amount of sushi as a remuneration and do launch a margin trading feature for sushi. So there was a community that was start to form around sushi and start to build on top of it, which is to my surprise because I didn't expect that to happen at all. I'm not sure why.
00:12:04.242 - 00:12:21.014, Speaker B: I think probably they have the first mobile advantage to be the first to fought off uniswap and get the cow like attention in the space to congregate towards them. But yeah, I talked to the team and also did my research. There is a pretty vibrant improvement happening.
00:12:21.014 - 00:12:29.770, Speaker B: It's a bit chaotic as well. It's a bit like a grassroots kind of democracy, like, fast moving, a bit chaotic. But it is working, and there are people working on improving the product.
00:12:29.770 - 00:12:53.474, Speaker B: So that's what changed my mind. And I think that the difference between sushi and uniswap right now is really that unisoft is a bit more like a very elite cow project right now. There's like a top pedigree, like, backed by the top venture fund in the space and unisoft V three is supposedly have a very good breakthrough in the technical feature that will solve a lot of the current issue.
00:12:53.474 - 00:13:14.506, Speaker B: Sushiso is more like a grassroots kind of version that respond to the community demand and iterate fast and build on the features that community really want such as the margin trading and various other features. So I think that's the difference right now and it start to become more differentiated. So that changed my view.
00:13:14.506 - 00:13:25.310, Speaker B: I think the social swap is here to stay and might consistently be the top three or top five decks in the space going forward if they can keep up the innovation.
00:13:27.330 - 00:13:46.774, Speaker A: What I like about them is they are also working on a pretty big upgrade called BentoBox. I think it's almost like a global wrapper for all the assets that exist in SushiSwap. And the goal is to increase the capital efficiency of basically all the money that the LPs put in there.
00:13:46.774 - 00:14:01.820, Speaker A: So tokens can be lent out or made available for lending as well as sit in a Dex pool at the same time. So this kind of goes back to how the Y pool in Kirk for example did it.
00:14:02.430 - 00:14:03.578, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:14:03.744 - 00:14:40.760, Speaker C: I guess what's interesting about Sushi too is FTX. Alameda, they were one of the biggest LPs in the beginning and kind of took a more active role there as well and then kind of proposed various integrations with Solana and serum and then you kind of see now Sushi exploring Moonbeam and Polkadot. So I do think too that because Sushi is very grassroots driven and sort of it's just based on what the users ultimately think is the best direction for them.
00:14:40.760 - 00:15:00.990, Speaker C: I think Sushi is going to be quite a trendsetter in terms of going cross chain where there's value to do so and going toward just as chain agnostic and as principal agnostic as possible and sort of more just trying to maximize value for holders.
00:15:05.890 - 00:15:22.980, Speaker A: The third Dex is zero X and I actually don't know much about it. Probably one of the DEXes that I know the least about. So I'm very curious to hear what would you say maybe in relation to the ones we've already discussed uniswap SushiSwap? So what's Xerox doing?
00:15:24.390 - 00:15:40.214, Speaker B: Okay, so I think probably I'll explain it. So Xerox is actually, I think one of the first one of the earliest decentralized exchange protocol itself. They're actually not a Dex, they are actually a protocol for decentralized exchange to build on top of.
00:15:40.214 - 00:15:52.842, Speaker B: So I think what they have discovered is that at that point of time that you need a common protocol for different decks to build on top so that you can share liquidity. So their model is a little bit like the RFQ model and adopted by the professional market maker.
00:15:52.906 - 00:15:54.554, Speaker A: RFQ being request.
00:15:54.602 - 00:16:01.498, Speaker B: Request for quote. Yeah. So you can press a button, you get a quote from the market maker.
00:16:01.498 - 00:16:21.442, Speaker B: So the order book is not on chain. It's actually like an off chain model maintained by all the Zero X relayers to communicate each other and to match the price among each other. And obviously there are some economic incentive to ensure that they do match order and do not front run their users.
00:16:21.442 - 00:16:34.890, Speaker B: So there are certain economic element in it, but basically it's like an off chain order book, but on chain matching model. But it's not exactly an order book. It's like an IFQ that the relayer will talk to each other to share the liquidity.
00:16:34.890 - 00:17:01.054, Speaker B: It's definitely one of the more long lasting decentralized exchange protocol because it was launched in 2017 and the ICO and I think they launched a product in late 2017 and been used since then. Obviously the adoption has been pretty slow, but EO has always been there since the beginning. But I think some of the issue was during the earlier stage, a lot of the more promising relayer like Paradex was actually acquired by Coinbase.
00:17:01.054 - 00:17:10.722, Speaker B: But I don't think there's any development happening on Paradex right now. It's kind of like being Sunset. Then there was a radar relay, but again, I think that is also being Sunset.
00:17:10.722 - 00:17:20.050, Speaker B: I'm not sure what's happening. The team doesn't seem to be building on it anymore. The domain is still there, you can still use it, but nobody's really using it anymore.
00:17:20.050 - 00:17:43.162, Speaker B: So the problem is, I think the incentive is just not sufficient and the volume is also not sufficient for the relayer to really make a living from building a Zero X relayer. So that is kind of the challenge that lead to none of the zero X relay really successful. That's why before Uniswap really changed the decks landscape, the volume was always only Zero X, IDEX and Kyber.
00:17:43.162 - 00:18:00.182, Speaker B: So before Uniswap becomes successful, this is the three only decks that really doing some volume, but still very minimalist, less than $1 million volume a day. So nobody really cares at that point of time. Recently, they kind of have some mini resurgence because I think that they changed the token economics a little bit.
00:18:00.182 - 00:18:19.260, Speaker B: I think it was early this year or late last year. So that actually the fee does go to the Xerox relay. So instead of a pure 2017 era of utility token you pay to assess services, it become like a little bit of small value capture inside the token, but it's still pretty insignificant, I would say.
00:18:19.260 - 00:18:43.234, Speaker B: There was one wallet, the Im Token wallet, which is the most largest ethereum and actually crypto wallet in China. They actually built their own version of Xerox relayer called Token Loan that actually built on Xerox protocol and that has been quite successful for the last six months. And that actually drive, I would say, more than 90% of the Xerox relayer volume right now.
00:18:43.234 - 00:19:03.306, Speaker B: Oh, what is quite yeah, so, yeah, it's just a mobile based decks and it's a Xerox relayer that built on Xerox protocol. The Chinese especially asia user will be more familiar with because it's really the biggest ethereum wallet in China, obviously. And they launched their own aggregator Macha, which is quite similar.
00:19:03.306 - 00:19:22.902, Speaker B: It's a Dex aggregator which aggregate liquidity from every place. But they also have their own proprietary liquidity source by the Periscope which is their own market making arm of zero X which I think is driving decent part of the zero X protocol volume as well. So I think that aggregated play which is Macha has been fairly successful.
00:19:22.902 - 00:19:35.666, Speaker B: So it's been making them the top three top five decks by volume right now. But I'm not sure what's the next step right now. Yeah, I think that's a key question.
00:19:35.666 - 00:19:44.210, Speaker B: I think the token has been there. It was based on coinbase like since 2017. Definitely one of the more old school DFI project before the term DFI was even created.
00:19:44.210 - 00:19:55.260, Speaker B: But right now it's definitely losing a little bit of shine among the latest crop of DFI. And I think that we just need to know what's the next step before that people are more interested in it.
00:19:56.430 - 00:20:04.746, Speaker A: Xerox is the only exchange in this list that's not an AMM. I think it uses kind of order book based model, correct?
00:20:04.848 - 00:20:06.910, Speaker B: Yeah, kyber is like a hybrid.
00:20:07.810 - 00:20:18.660, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, yeah, I was going to ask you so what do you think about this debate going forward? Which of those is going to win the AMM or kind of the RFQ auto book based model?
00:20:20.070 - 00:20:52.480, Speaker B: I think this is a very interesting debate and I don't think we are going to see a conclusion so soon. I think that everyone, a lot of people even in the DeFi space, including me myself, was pretty skeptical of a pure Xyk constant AMM model initially because we think that beyond the long tail asset is just too capital inefficient to work. But I think probably you guys discussed in this previous podcast before, you actually do not have to be the best solution, you just have to be good enough solution for a lot of the retail user that actually do not have a better solution for.
00:20:52.480 - 00:21:10.642, Speaker B: So I think AMA is definitely going to be there for a foreseeable future. But again, I don't think order book model will go away. I think for spot decks definitely, I think AMM have a stronger edge right now due to the underlying base layer issue.
00:21:10.642 - 00:21:43.660, Speaker B: But I think if the base layer performance can improve further, probably we can see audible base decks to be able to compete with AMM based decks in future. But I think that another innovation of AMM Dex is it combines some of the asset management element with a Dex liquidity provision. Because if you think this two pair of assets is going to range bound in value, it actually makes sense for you to provide liquidity using the Constance product model.
00:21:43.660 - 00:22:01.860, Speaker B: And that is indeed an innovation so that people might not be just providing liquidity for the sake of providing liquidity but it's also they are attracted to the asset management element as well. I think they both will coexist but it's too early to write off order book decentralized exchange right now.
00:22:04.470 - 00:22:31.338, Speaker A: There was kind of an AHA moment for me when I realized that an AMM dex is more dex as a kind of side product. And actually, you can think of it mainly as basically an investment strategy for investors who want to kind of sell volatility and who basically want to be rebalanced by the market to have a fixed weight of assets in their portfolio, which is how ETFs. For example, work.
00:22:31.338 - 00:22:57.026, Speaker A: Another protocol that leans into the kind of fixed weight investing framework would be balancer, because it allows more than two assets to be in each pool. And that's one of the main innovations in balancer. So you can have more assets in a pool in a fixed rate with each other and people can have way more customization available when setting up the pool.
00:22:57.026 - 00:23:07.478, Speaker A: So they can actually change the fee that is charged. It's not a standard fee like on Uniswap. And they can also change the curve itself, I believe.
00:23:07.478 - 00:23:11.590, Speaker A: So what do you guys think about balancer?
00:23:12.170 - 00:23:34.914, Speaker B: I think he's actually for me even until now. It's definitely one of the bigger mystery in DeFi on why, despite the similar feature, balancer lacked behind, uniswap and even SushiSwap so hard in terms of the user number and also volume. Like, if you look at the latest number, I think that the Balancer TVL is not that bad.
00:23:34.914 - 00:24:05.002, Speaker B: It's around 600 million volume which is around half of let's say Sushi swap volume but there was a TVL but when you look at the volume Sushi swap is doing 150,000,000 volume today for the last 24 hours and balancer is only doing 25 million volume. So the volume to TVL ratio of balancer is very low compared to both Sushi swap and unisop. And in a way, both Sushi swap and Unisor is actually only a subset of balancer when they come to the AMA model.
00:24:05.002 - 00:24:36.210, Speaker B: Because balancer, you can do 50 50 weight, you can do 80, 2090, ten, and even like a 30, 33, 333. So from a pure logic like a quantitative point of view there is no reason that you should not use balancer over Unisoft or Sushisoft but the fact is it is way less used by DeFi users. I think that a commonly cited reason is the user interface and the user experience is just not as good as both uni and sushi.
00:24:36.210 - 00:25:11.818, Speaker B: And I think the gas cost is higher. Although I think for power users that's probably not the main reason but I think a lot of the TV out there is actually quite of stale. Like the people who are there is just actually kind of to farm the balancer pool token and also to farm the other native token reward pool for other that set up that liquidity pool in balancer just to have some sort of liquidity, but usually their weightage are not 50 50, sometimes 80 20, which is quite suboptimal for certain way for one direction of trade.
00:25:11.818 - 00:25:40.482, Speaker B: So that's probably the reason that drive the big disparity between the volume to TVL ratio for Balancer and I think the UIUX and the gas cost issue definitely plays a part. And beyond that, I actually think that it's a decent product. I think that it's a further next step on Uniswap in terms of combining asset management investment product with a liquidity provision and it's even more customizable.
00:25:40.482 - 00:26:03.870, Speaker B: And it's also the liquidity balance bootstrapping pool which is used by quite a number of DeFi protocols to bootstrap. The initial liquidity was also a good innovation. So I like Balance as a product, the innovation and some of the features, but the fact is it's not as gained as much traction compared to both Uni and Sushi for a number of reasons.
00:26:03.870 - 00:26:15.190, Speaker B: I think that it's just that they probably just need to innovate, improve their UIUX, low optimize their cash costs and find the next step. But I'm not 100% sure what is the next big improvement coming.
00:26:15.380 - 00:26:43.706, Speaker C: Yeah, I just would second the idea that the Balancer user experience is pretty bad. You get a lot of failure messages that for normal users they don't really understand what's going on. I think there was a few bugs in the early days too that were pretty scary for people, which is really quite ironic, right, because if you remember WiFi farming, those are all Balancer pools.
00:26:43.706 - 00:26:58.260, Speaker C: So you would have thought that given the massive growth of Wi Fi since then, that Balancer would have done better, but somehow it didn't really manage to deliver something that people wanted to use every day.
00:27:00.230 - 00:27:21.098, Speaker A: Yeah, with those concerns. So the UX balancer is probably maybe of all the projects on the entire list, the one that has the biggest question marks in terms of like there are so obviously low hanging fruits that you could improve and it would just make the project like a couple times better. Right.
00:27:21.098 - 00:27:42.800, Speaker A: If you only forked Uniswap's front end and user interface then it would immediately be such a relief. I don't think anyone really uses the Balancer front end. Like all the volume that's actually driven to Balancer is from aggregators because the existing front end is such a joke, actually.
00:27:42.800 - 00:28:12.342, Speaker A: And I also think you're totally correct that a lot of the liquidity is stale. We looked into this a while ago and Balancer is actually, of all the DEXes, the one that pays the most for liquidity in terms of token rewards. But I almost want to say it's like a circle jerk because a huge amount of the liquidity actually goes to bell holders.
00:28:12.342 - 00:28:51.830, Speaker A: Right? I want to say it's like 50% of the entire rewards goes to kind of bell pools and even bell against third or fourth class DFI assets. That have absolutely zero trading volume earn huge amounts of rewards just from being in a 50 50 or 80 20 pool with Bell. So I think that it's a project that has so many question marks about it, but at the same time, fundamentally it looks quite, I mean, maybe they, I don't know, have to revisit some of their actual business decisions.
00:28:51.830 - 00:29:10.138, Speaker A: So Bancorp, I don't know much about it other than it's sort of a one sided AMM model. So how does that differ from what union SushiSwap do?
00:29:10.304 - 00:29:24.862, Speaker B: Okay, I think Bangkok was also one of the oldest decks in the space and actually they are the first one to come out of the AMA model. But I think the difference is okay, I think some background story actually. Bangkok launched one of the biggest ICO in ethereum history.
00:29:24.862 - 00:29:43.190, Speaker B: I think they raised more than 100 million from the ICO and actually got a fair amount of flake from that. But they did launch a product, I think fairly early on, I think late 2017, and they always been working since 2018. So you have to give them credit for that, for really building a product during the bear market.
00:29:43.190 - 00:30:01.894, Speaker B: But the main difference is the Bangkok, it's also AMM, but the liquidity is concentrated on the BNT token itself. So instead of like a hoop from ETH to USD, you actually have to go from ETH to Bangkok then from Bangkok to USD. So I think that create a lot of user friction.
00:30:01.894 - 00:30:25.518, Speaker B: A lot of people don't want to hold the Bancorp token just to provide liquidity. So you can say that's probably one of the main reasons that Bangkok uniswap did so well compared to Bancorp, because a lot of the ethereums, they just don't want to touch anything except ethereum and probably some other stable coins. So they were happy to provide liquidity for ETH to USD, but they just don't touch any coin.
00:30:25.518 - 00:30:46.874, Speaker B: Especially the uniswap early days is really supported by mainly ethereum bills before the whole liquidity mining thing. So that is a friction. But they did have a massive improvement recently, which is like you can provide a single site liquidity, you don't need to provide both token pair and actually how they solve the impermanent loss issue.
00:30:46.874 - 00:31:11.858, Speaker B: They're actually going to use the Banco BNT token itself to provide subsidies as an impermanent loss. So if the liquidity providers suffer impermanent loss, they will actually, I think, issue more or just take some of the existing BNT to give it to the liquidity provider to cover the impermanent losses to incentivize liquidity on BNT. And he has launched it a while back, I think it's called Bangkok V Three.
00:31:11.858 - 00:31:24.854, Speaker B: I think he has seen some improvement, some traction. He's doing around 7 million every last 24 hours. See some slight increase in TVL as well, but it's still not at the top five decks by volume right now.
00:31:24.854 - 00:31:37.974, Speaker B: So I think it's constant AMA model similar to. Unisop and it even have the impermanent loss kind of subsidized by the token holder as well. So, again, I'm not super familiar.
00:31:37.974 - 00:32:07.974, Speaker B: I'm also not 100% sure why it's not as successful as both uni associate, but I think there is probably some user experience reason as well. And personally, I am a bit wary of the previous work done by the team on how they handle the whole ICO and also how the whole EOS thing I think there are some controversy. I'm not 100% sure, I didn't follow that much.
00:32:07.974 - 00:32:21.430, Speaker B: But I think that they are always not the counter favorite child of the Ethereum community. You cannot underestimate the importance of Ethereum community. They just don't like Bangkok.
00:32:21.430 - 00:32:24.250, Speaker B: So yeah, I think that's it about Bangkok.
00:32:27.630 - 00:32:36.558, Speaker A: So three arrows actually invested in Kyber pretty early, right? So what can you say about Kyber, the last exchange on our Dex list?
00:32:36.644 - 00:32:50.498, Speaker C: Yeah, Kyber we have a good relationship with. We've helped them with a variety of financial services as well. I think definitely a very early project as well, a 2017 project.
00:32:50.498 - 00:33:19.962, Speaker C: I think Arthur can probably speak to how he sees it playing out in the overall ecosystem of Dex has definitely gotten more competitive these days. But I think what's interesting too with KNC staking is that I think they kind of pioneer the idea that instead of a buy and burn, you're going to get actual cash flows from the coin. And I do think that's a superior model.
00:33:19.962 - 00:33:58.714, Speaker C: I mean, it's worse for people who have to pay taxes, but I do think it's generally good to assume people not paying taxes in like I would just assume this as a rule. So given that people don't pay tax in DeFi, I think that it's better that they have their KNC staked and then they're getting cash flows while they don't have to touch their balance. I think that that whole user experience has now been convincingly shown to lead to better engagement and better understanding of what kind of returns are being offered by the protocol and also how to improve it.
00:33:58.714 - 00:34:03.180, Speaker C: So I think Kyber kind of was at the forefront of that as well.
00:34:05.550 - 00:34:21.514, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm pretty familiar with Kyber. So I think the interesting thing is I actually followed the development process pretty closely fairly early on. So I think the interesting thing is kyber was fairly under the radar for most part of the 2019.
00:34:21.514 - 00:34:34.862, Speaker B: I would say that even though they actually buy volume, the top three for the most part of the 2019. So second half of 2019 over Kyber and Uniswap was consistently the top two decks by volume. Obviously the time changed.
00:34:34.862 - 00:34:43.830, Speaker B: Right now they are not in the win in the top five. And I think that their model was always kind of like quite ahead of its time. They kind of think that on chain liquidity is very important.
00:34:43.830 - 00:34:53.094, Speaker B: So everything for Kyber is on chain. If you're a market maker, on Kyber. Every new code you're providing is actually a new transaction on chain.
00:34:53.094 - 00:35:13.466, Speaker B: So actually yes, it's quite expensive, but they have a different way of providing liquidity. So that's why it's like a hybrid AMM. So you can use a uniswap version of a constant product Xyk model usually adopted by the treasury team like synthetics or others to just have a very passive way of providing liquidity on Kyber.
00:35:13.466 - 00:35:54.774, Speaker B: And then you also have a professional market maker can use something what they call a fat price reserve model to customize a lot more on how are they providing the liquidity. Like the pricing will not be like a constant product, it will be a lot more like a traditional order book way of decreasing liquidity as you go further from the mid price. And it was fairly successful at that point in time and they recognized that they were one of the earliest oico ODFI project to recognize that, yes, they need to change token economics and that's why they have changed it, that you have to participate in the governance to get some of the free reward that is non inflationary.
00:35:54.774 - 00:36:27.986, Speaker B: It's paid in ethereum and they also still remain some of the burning component as well, although it's a fairly small part of the total token value capture right now. I think they have always maintained that the capital efficiency is fairly important because I think during late 2019 they were doing on par volume with Unisor at one 10th of the capital of the TBR. So they think that model is clearly superior because with way lower amount of capital we can support a higher amount of volume.
00:36:27.986 - 00:36:51.514, Speaker B: And so I think they have always believed in that and I think that's not wrong, it's actually correct in certain way. But I think what they don't really foresee happen is including me as well is how underserved the retail is in terms of they actually want to have some product that can actually also earn you and probably help the project that they like. At the same time they don't mind providing some extra liquidity.
00:36:51.514 - 00:37:26.234, Speaker B: And when you have like a 5000 retail token holder that each of them provide a few thousand dollars liquidity, it adds up to be a pretty significant part of the portion of the total liquidity and help to bootstrap the initial liquidity pool until the professional market maker to step in. So I think this is what they don't really foresee and so they always be more thinking that the professional market maker is the better solution to solve the liquidity issue instead of gathering liquidity from retail to do that. So I think that's why when the whole DeFi summer happened, balancer launched a liquidity mining campaign and also Uniswap did the same thing.
00:37:26.234 - 00:37:43.066, Speaker B: They did not have the room to innovate on that because the token supply is already there. They can't really change that much because they already have token sale back in 2017 so they are a little bit restricted in that. And as a result, their volume did not experience a parabolic growth like what happened to Unisop.
00:37:43.066 - 00:38:00.898, Speaker B: So Unisop volume had probably grown 100 times this year and Kyber had probably grown like ten times. It's still a very impressive growth, but when you compare them to Unisop, it's an order of magnitude difference right now. But DEXA is definitely one of the most legit D Five and Dex protocol.
00:38:00.898 - 00:38:09.800, Speaker B: But I think that they are doing a little bit of a soul searching process on the next step on competing in the Dex space because it's definitely very competitive right now.
00:38:11.850 - 00:38:37.410, Speaker A: That sort of wraps it up for the Dex category. And I'd have a question for you about this whole category. So what do you see happen in 2021? For example, could you imagine that centralized exchanges start routing orders to DEXs and sort of act as the front end for the user and interacting with a lot of these DeFi protocols?
00:38:41.590 - 00:38:59.782, Speaker B: I think the Central Exchange will not do it directly. I think that's not really within their responsibility. I think they will just delegate this task to the professional market maker, which is prevalent right now for some of the long tail asset or some of the newer asset that just get listed on Central Exchange.
00:38:59.782 - 00:39:23.710, Speaker B: I think that the professional market maker will actually source the liquidity from Decentral Exchange so that there are sufficient liquidity on the Central Exchange. I think that's actually what happened to probably Wi Fi, because I don't think Wi Fi have an official deal with any professional market maker. I think they probably have to get some of the token from decentralized themselves because that's the only source of liquidity or from finance.
00:39:23.710 - 00:39:48.614, Speaker B: I think the professional market maker will do the job for the exchanges. And I think in terms of the view on 2021, I think that the market share will continue to grow. That means, I think that Dex volume will grow at a faster rate than Central Exchange, but I think that both of them, the volume will also experience a pretty exponential growth as well.
00:39:48.614 - 00:40:06.960, Speaker B: I think it's possible we see like a DFI Dex do, like a consistent, like a 500 million to $1 billion volume a day. And I think that if the layer two solution adoption is as successful as what the most optimistic person think, yeah, I think that's possible.
00:40:08.210 - 00:40:39.238, Speaker C: Yeah, I think definitely we'll see CFI and DeFi volumes grow, especially for the exchanges like Binance.com and the ones that are non us. I I see as almost having already been a sort of like cross chain layer two, right, in a sense, because you're depositing various different coins to Binance and then they're giving you back other coins that you can withdraw.
00:40:39.238 - 00:41:16.950, Speaker C: And I think you've seen that volume go through the roof along with DeFi actually. So I think what kind of is likely to happen is that these exchanges are going to be able to offer CDFI that kind of makes sense for them where they're getting a cut of the staking reward, let's say in the case of Sushi or something else. And conversely, users that are already quite familiar with the binance experience or some other exchange experience, they'll just use that and they don't have to deal with on chain.
00:41:16.950 - 00:42:08.550, Speaker C: So I think you kind of see that high hybrid approach. I do think though that there's going to be continued pressure for exchanges to list the popular DVI assets very quickly because nowadays an asset just comes out it's immediately in uniswap SushiSwap and does well and exchanges rush to list it. I think that that's only going to continue and I think they're going to eventually try to figure out ways to support as many of the beneficial actions on chain as possible for users because that stems the flow of capital out of centralized exchanges and gets them to stay if they think they can get the same benefits on the exchange.
00:42:13.370 - 00:42:56.114, Speaker A: Moving on to our second category, I labeled this the lending category and we have projects in Yaave, Compound, Maker, synthetics and humor. But I would further distinguish between protocols where people basically deposit spot coins and you can basically lend those out and other people can deposit collateral and then borrow the coins that you put in, but there are no new coins being issued. And then coins like maker and synthetics where you deposit collateral, but then the coin that is issued is actually created from that collateral.
00:42:56.114 - 00:43:08.778, Speaker A: So it's tokenized debt and that debt can be stable against an oracle. And that's basically how you can create any synthetic asset that you want. That's kind of how all those three works.
00:43:08.778 - 00:43:14.650, Speaker A: But let's get first into the spot lending category. So we have ave and compound.
00:43:15.150 - 00:43:39.650, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that the spot lending category is kind of interesting because it's actually quite obvious that there's two very dominant leaders in this space right now, which is RBE and Compound. And I think all the others don't really come close. So it's really a two way race right now and I think they are quite interesting because Compound was definitely the first mover.
00:43:39.650 - 00:44:10.214, Speaker B: But Albe managed to catch up fairly earlier on and I think that their main difference is really like a traditional kind of faster moving, agile, newer comer against a more established one which they are probably move a little bit slower. They are trying to do things in a more careful and cautious manner and that's what the main difference between Aave and Compound. So I think I'll talk a little bit more about RWE first.
00:44:10.214 - 00:44:50.758, Speaker B: So Ave, I think that what they did is they strike a good balance between innovation and also the security of the protocol because being a lending and borrowing protocol the security is probably one of the most important thing because if they have some issue the entire asset of the protocol can be drained. So it's good that both Compound and Ave have no issue on this before, that people cannot just drain the asset randomly. And I think that when you strike a good amount of balance between security and innovation and that is what drive a significant part of the growth of Ave.
00:44:50.758 - 00:45:20.638, Speaker B: So Ave was only launched, ave V One was launched in January this year and they hit like one and a half billion of TVL during the D Five summer which is in less than seven months. So I think that even during the Fintech history you probably have not seen such a fast growth in TVL before and that was without their own native liquidity mining. Granted they get a lot of help from yen, from their own kind of like a stable coin U project that just automatically redirect to Ave.
00:45:20.638 - 00:45:42.922, Speaker B: But nonetheless, one and a half billion TV in seven months is very impressive, I would say for anything in the world. And the protocol is secure enough and the team is really they know what the community wants and been very reactive and responsive in delivering that. And their token economics also is the same.
00:45:42.922 - 00:46:26.130, Speaker B: They were actually an oico, it was called Land and they rendered to Aave and they actually know that their old token economics is not the most optimal one and they actually spent a lot of time thinking about how to improve it and I think the outcome was fairly successful. I think everyone think that the token was a very well designed especially that it has some sort of value capture but it's not like a pure rent sticking because the Ave token holder that is staking are actually providing kind of like an insurance backstop to the lender on the protocol. So if there's under collateralized event for the lender RV staker is actually responsible for kind of like slashing some of their stake to repay the under collateralized portion of the debt.
00:46:26.130 - 00:46:41.942, Speaker B: So this make the lender feel safer to interact because you know that it's like some sort of backstop in the pace. So in a sense it's a little bit similar to you can think of in the conceptually like equity of the bank. The bank equity is then backed up the bad debts.
00:46:41.942 - 00:46:57.310, Speaker B: So I think that is the good token economic design part of Aave. And right now they have some small amount of liquidity mining but the U is so low it's probably less than 5% a year. So it's not really the main reason that people go and like a participant.
00:46:57.310 - 00:47:26.298, Speaker B: I think albay there's a lot of organic economic activities and the flash loan innovation, they are the one that popularized the term and also the usage of it. So yeah, I think they are definitely one of the top DeFi team and a very young and very fast moving agile team that doesn't sacrifice the security of the protocol at the same time, which is a pretty rare and important combination. I think that I expect them to remain the top lending and borrowing protocol for the foreseeable future.
00:47:26.298 - 00:48:03.634, Speaker B: And I think for Compound it's definitely the first one to popularize the money market based approach to lending and borrowing and this has been proven to be extremely successful. And even the earliest DeFi protocol, one of the earliest dharma actually pivoted from a pure matching based model to a pool based model and instead to build on top of a compound. So I think that this approach is definitely the most successful approach and they have been very secure, no major incidents so far and they also kind of synthetics is technically the first one to start the liquidity mining campaign.
00:48:03.634 - 00:48:33.594, Speaker B: But Compound is the one that started the whole craze of liquidity mining and I think that is kind of like they get some credit for jumpstarting the entire DeFi summer over the last few months. So it's definitely one of the more successful protocol. But I think that right now the new direction of Compound chain, I think there was still a lot of question what is the main takeaway from this? I think that the vision is probably to connect all the different chain including probably some CBDC.
00:48:33.594 - 00:48:49.554, Speaker B: I think there's some other speculation but that vision seems very big. I'm not sure how are they going to pull it off in practice. And right now it seems like initially when they launched a governance module there was a lot of interest and passion for people to keep improving the compound protocol.
00:48:49.554 - 00:49:04.042, Speaker B: But right now I think the passion kind of waned a little bit. The governance did not move as fast as it used to. I think that the team probably I think the pure decentralized method, I think this applies to RV as well.
00:49:04.042 - 00:49:20.480, Speaker B: I think that the governance apathy real like pure 1.1 vote will leave to a lot of people just end up not participating as well. So I think that not sure how are they going to keep up the innovation if the governors keep having a little bit discount like a stale issue.
00:49:22.690 - 00:50:00.330, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Compound ave obviously by far the two biggest borrow lending. My firm three era is also pretty active in the ODC borrow lending so it's been fascinating to kind of compare and contrast the different approaches that they take. I do think Compound was very prescient in seeing that the broker matching model would kind of not be the one that takes off and has a network effect in onchain in decentralized finance.
00:50:00.330 - 00:50:54.640, Speaker C: For the main reason that I think peer to pool activity is definitely preferred where people can just supply assets and get some yield no matter how small they can put something in and they can borrow against it. So I think that kind of two sided asynchronous borrow lending is pretty interesting and they kind of basically invented yield farming as it is, where people are getting the comp token as they supply and borrow from it. And they definitely had a very ambitious token emission program which was intended to get people to participate as much as possible in the governance and give it to the users, so to speak.
00:50:54.640 - 00:52:07.154, Speaker C: But I do think that the idea of yield farming and liquidity provision, it does always raise the question of who will actually be the users, right? Because every activity that has a dollar reward will become a dollar auction. Who has the capital and who has the desire to earn that coin? And what if they really want, do they want to earn that reward because they want to participate or do they want to earn that reward because that's the highest ROI they can find, right? So I think compound kind of suffered a bit from that kind of mercenary farming activity and I think it's something where because they have had to rely on that for their TVL, it's kind of something that they can't get away from either, right? Because if they stopped rewards then the TVL would also collapse and go to Ave. So they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because the TVL they have is generally there for farming, especially double sided farming.
00:52:07.154 - 00:52:39.280, Speaker C: But then if the farming were to stop in any way, then it would go to Ave. So you're in this kind of a very tricky spot because of the way that it's positioned in the market. So I think that's the biggest challenge for Compound, I think, know, for its part, it also is very reliant on its own native token, but also on Link as well, where there's like key assets that are in Ave and not in compound, things like that.
00:52:39.280 - 00:52:58.886, Speaker C: But I think what they've been better at is having better terms for things that people want, right? So like WBDC, collateral factors, know, having Wi Fi earlier, all these type of things. I think they're just a lot more reactive, a lot more responsive. The governance is sounder as well, the token distribution is much better.
00:52:58.886 - 00:53:07.080, Speaker C: So I think it's not a surprise that it's outperformed compound quite a bit. I generally think it'll continue to do so for those reasons as well.
00:53:08.890 - 00:53:32.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. But I also would say, like credit where credit is due. I always love to when I tell someone new about compound then I always like sorry about DeFi then compound is always one of the first projects that I talk about because it brought a lot of fundamental innovation to DeFi that makes DeFi very different and unique from traditional finance.
00:53:32.598 - 00:54:19.870, Speaker A: So for example, one of the first things that I would mention is kind of tokenized balances. So when you deposit collateral into compound and Ave, of course, then you get a C token, a compound token, and you can use that compound token that represents your savings in compound in other so. And Arthur actually touched on that, the cooperation between Urine and Ave, where there were so called Y tokens that actually put basically your money into Aave and a couple other money protocols, depending on where you get the best yield at the time.
00:54:19.870 - 00:54:37.974, Speaker A: And then you could still put those Y tokens into Curve AMM pool. So they would actually earn triple yield at the time, right? Which was I guess one of the best yield farming opportunities at the time. Yeah.
00:54:37.974 - 00:54:55.258, Speaker A: So the difference between the synthetics lending category and the spot lending category is in the synthetics lending category, the asset you lend is actually created from thin air. Basically. You can think of it as tokenized debt and that debt can be stable against whatever you want.
00:54:55.258 - 00:55:10.906, Speaker A: As long as there's an oracle that provides price data, then you can do that. And the biggest one of those would be Maker and Maker issues. Only one synthetic that's issued from collateral and that synthetic is Dai.
00:55:10.906 - 00:55:25.194, Speaker A: It's the biggest synthetic stablecoin as of right now with I think about 1.2 billion die in circulation. So what do you guys think about Maker and Die?
00:55:25.342 - 00:55:54.794, Speaker B: I think that Maker is first of all, definitely should get a credit for being actually the first DeFi protocol and to launch successfully and get some of the adoption and proof that it's possible to launch a decentralized stablecoin and have went through multiple big market correction event and still be there. I think that's definitely not easy. Existing itself is actually a big issue because I remember that I was very bullish on stablecoin back in 2017.
00:55:54.794 - 00:56:13.358, Speaker B: I was actually looking into what stablecoin projects that we can actually invest in. And there was Tether, but you can't really get a price exposure to Tether. And I found about Maker and there was actually a lot of the theoretical debate back then about how the flaws on Maker model is not going to work, it's not going to scale.
00:56:13.358 - 00:56:28.410, Speaker B: And despite all that, more than 1 billion die in the circulation right now, which is a success. Definitely a success. And the model has been shown to be possible to bootstrap a decentralized stable coin from scratch.
00:56:28.410 - 00:56:58.490, Speaker B: So I think that is definitely credit where it's due being the first D Five protocol to the major D Five protocol. They get a lot of support from everyone in the space because everyone initially want to see them succeed. So when you see the Q One 2019, when the D Five starts getting started, dharma compound, no, that time they all support the die because they are like kind of the de facto stablecoin of the D Five.
00:56:58.490 - 00:57:31.654, Speaker B: It still is right now, but I would say that usage from other stablecoin have increased significantly in DeFi right now. It's definitely one of the top DeFi protocol out there, but I think that also there is a lot of issue. So I think I'll be probably a little bit not so politically correct on this, which to say that if you're like a super knowledgeable and sharp have a good understanding into D Five fairly early on because I would say the true smart money already recognized the potential of D Five in around mid 2019.
00:57:31.654 - 00:57:46.258, Speaker B: Everyone can't see the potential but just not sure how big it will be. And there are some that think that okay, maker MKR token is the best way to get exposure to DFI because it's the leader of DFI. What can you go wrong? It has the biggest adoption by far.
00:57:46.258 - 00:58:06.614, Speaker B: Yeah, the token economics have some issue but it can be fixed. So if that is your thesis, you put all your money into Maker, you underperform so much during the whole DeFi wave this year that's just not even an understatement. You even underperform Ethereum itself if you ask to.
00:58:06.614 - 00:58:40.770, Speaker B: I think you have a lot of things to say about this. So I think that's the kind of irony, despite being one of the most successful default protocol, it's not being reflected in the token price of Maker itself and that can't lead to a lot of the disillusioned among the community. And I think that right now I think the governance is there's obviously still some very passionate core community member participating, but I don't think there's a new fresh blood joining the maker community to really participate in the governance and drive them to a new direction.
00:58:40.770 - 00:59:47.314, Speaker B: And their approach of trying to onboard centralized asset as part of the collateral base also have also caused a difference in opinion amongst all the key community member because they think that means it's not fully censorship resistant anymore, although it does allow Dai to scale faster and bigger as well. So I think there's a key debate, I don't think there's a right to wrong or wrong answer to that, but again, I think has caused a lot of challenges and I think that the next step for Dai is pretty challenging in a way that how is it going to go beyond the next step? Are you going to take the real world assets such as some of the mortgage into assets? So how are you going to do the off chain liquidation? I think that is quite challenging and the value capture also need a very tour of review on how it can align the success of the protocol together with the token value. Because right now that is clearly not working and among all the token model, buyback and burn is the least preferred model in my opinion.
00:59:47.314 - 01:00:18.578, Speaker B: Because I think a placeholder BC wrote a very good article on that. Basically, if you're like early stage growth stage be like a company or like a network protocol, you should not really be burning your token because that's kind of like destroying your network capital, which I 100% agree with. At early stage, you really should invest in growth instead of burning away your token, because that's like a redomination of it can make the token price go a little bit, but I don't think it really serves the protocol much in the long run.
01:00:18.578 - 01:00:20.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that's the dye maker.
01:00:21.006 - 01:00:46.300, Speaker A: So if you were put in charge now in Mecca as the kind of benevolent dictator, what would you do to get the project kind of back on? I always don't want to say back on track because the die growth has actually been so impressive. It's at $1.2 billion in comparison, the second biggest synthetic stablecoin SUSD, which we'll get to in a minute, is at 100 million.
01:00:46.300 - 01:01:00.474, Speaker A: So what would you do to, I guess, reinvigorate kind of the passion for this project and get some rewards to MKR holders.
01:01:00.522 - 01:01:33.638, Speaker B: For example, I think we do like an open call to the wider DeFi community to give an input on what is the best way to improve the Maker token economic going forward because I think that most people will agree with me that the current model is not the best model for Maker. I think, yeah, there's kind of like a consensus among a lot of people right now. So I didn't get an open call and I think some of the bright community members can probably put up some very thoughtful proposal and they can combine a few proposals and come with a better one to incentivize more community alignment with the growth of the protocol.
01:01:33.638 - 01:02:00.210, Speaker B: And also I think that one of the things that maker is not doing, which is actually you can consider them counter trend is like most DeFi protocol are actually rewarding their users for using them. Right now, I know it's not sustainable, but at the early stage it makes sense to do that to incentivize user to use a protocol, but Maker is actually not doing that. You are like a user of Maker, which is like you open a CDP, they call it Wild right now, you paid stability fee.
01:02:00.210 - 01:02:25.782, Speaker B: You're actually not being rewarded. And depending on who you ask, a lot of the user were actually penalized for using as early user because when March 13 happened, a lot of people were liquidated for zero that time and they're not getting any compensation. And the response is basically that oh, this is the early stage program, this experiment that you are taking the risk of using this, it's too bad, that's definitely destroyed a fair bit of the community confidence.
01:02:25.782 - 01:02:39.262, Speaker B: They need to restore that back as well. So I think that that's what I would do to really change the token economic and I wouldn't even mind printing more token. I don't think that's a stakehold, I think just like a number.
01:02:39.262 - 01:02:45.810, Speaker B: So you should be able to inflate the supply if you think it's necessary for the protocol to grow to the next stage.
01:02:47.670 - 01:03:11.062, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with a lot of that and I think too I've been quite publicly bearish on Maker for, I think almost. Two years now and I think actually not only has it underperformed DeFi, I think it actually has underperformed dollars which is quite impressive to even be able to do that's true for like three years. Yeah.
01:03:11.062 - 01:03:50.134, Speaker C: And I think it gets at the heart of a bigger problem for some projects, where if the coin distribution is too tightly controlled by similar types of thinkers or players, let's say usvcs, then you end up with a lot of choices that are not necessarily made for the interests of the community or the interests of the users, but for the interests of the investors. Right. And so that kind of question of how do you make your users rich from using it? Well, maker just decided they didn't want to do that at all.
01:03:50.134 - 01:04:19.760, Speaker C: Right. They kind of saw that as not part of the mission which kind of defeats the whole purpose of DeFi in some ways where the users are not benefiting from the protocol doing well, they don't have any. The maker holders are completely divorced from the CDP owners which creates this impossible traction where incentives are always at ODS and I think like even talking about buy and burn versus staking right.
01:04:19.760 - 01:04:52.534, Speaker C: Because the Usvcs are the ones holding it and because staking is so difficult for a lot of usvcs because of the fact that once you start staking a coin you trigger a lot of tax issues, especially for some of these Usvcs that have LPs who are charities or who are nonprofits. As soon as you get this staking yield element and this kind of element, it sometimes can trigger a lot of complex tax issues right. For some of these investors.
01:04:52.534 - 01:05:22.162, Speaker C: So basically you end up with this prioritization list that ends up having nothing to do with DeFi, has nothing to do with the protocol, but it has to do with who are the bag holders and what do they need at that moment. Right. A good example of maker price being pumped high and then overvalued is they need it to be propped high at that moment to make it look like they had adoption or they made it look like it did really well.
01:05:22.162 - 01:05:37.522, Speaker C: Right. Let's say they want that so that they can raise a second fund. But if that's what you want then that is obviously not going to be good for your users who then follow this and then buy it at the top and then have to watch it be flat in dollars over three years.
01:05:37.522 - 01:05:55.146, Speaker C: Right. So I think these kinds of things are the very kind of thorny issues in our space. There's honestly no right answer because to makers credit they have created a very successful stable coin.
01:05:55.146 - 01:06:09.026, Speaker C: They have created something very excellent. It has challenges but it is used and it is growing and the code does work. It's audited it's withstood some tests of time.
01:06:09.026 - 01:06:41.846, Speaker C: It has failed some of the other tests but it kind of gets back to what I mentioned in our previous podcast, which is like, what makes a project a success for a failure, right? Like Zcash could be the most successful fair coin because it makes people poor. So that it's fair, right? In that sense, Maker also makes you it makes you poor if you bought it. But if you just really wanted to borrow a decentralized stable coin against your ether and you happen to not do it during the bad times, that succeeds.
01:06:41.846 - 01:06:53.310, Speaker C: And if you just want to hold die and you put it into some DeFi protocols, that works. So who gets to decide if it's a failure? Is it just price alone? Right? I don't think it's just price. Right.
01:06:53.310 - 01:07:02.820, Speaker C: So I think it's a massive success on its own merits. I think price wise, it's a failure by design. I think the price is designed to fail in kind of that sense.
01:07:02.820 - 01:07:41.358, Speaker C: But to the extent that it kind of is achieving its initial goals, I think it's already surpassed some of those goals. And I think too, even with the off chain stuff and with that kind of stuff, if they do end up getting a regulatory mode for themselves, if their backers are closer with government regulators, I can imagine worlds where they have a privileged place in kind of be able to do that road. I'm not privy to those discussions and I'm not privy to how that works.
01:07:41.358 - 01:08:02.280, Speaker C: But it very well could be a reasonable road for them to go down to if they think that they have the clout to do so. Right? Imagine if they get the ability to do mortgages while nobody else can, because it's not up to us to say if that's good or bad. If they can pull it off, then power to them.
01:08:03.450 - 01:08:03.910, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:03.980 - 01:08:41.806, Speaker A: And there are two kind of competing visions when it comes to these real world assets, right? So on the one hand, people who are more focused on the stablecoin, they would say, but if you include real world assets, those are by definition censorable. So if Dai is then partially backed by these assets, then Dai is not actually decentralized stablecoin anymore. But on the other hand, you could argue that actually maker creates a lot of value for its users if they can get liquidity on kind of arcane assets that it's very difficult to borrow against otherwise.
01:08:41.806 - 01:09:26.206, Speaker A: And all it takes in DeFi is kind of price oracle and you need some way to liquidate them if necessary. But if they don't really like, if it's price stable assets, then you don't even have really the problems with liquidations and it's really a huge untapped field. For example, borrowing against debt, right? So you have kind of you're a business and you have basically payments incoming in the future, payment obligations from your customers, for example, then you could deposit those in Maker and borrow against them or royalties as a musician or whatever, right? So those things are extremely stable against the dollar.
01:09:26.206 - 01:09:42.470, Speaker A: So you don't even have really the problem liquidating them. And I think that's where a lot of people in Maker want to go. I just hope that they don't forget kind of the token holders along the way, the Maker token holders.
01:09:42.470 - 01:09:46.930, Speaker A: Should we move on to synthetics?
01:09:47.010 - 01:09:47.506, Speaker B: Sure.
01:09:47.628 - 01:10:27.806, Speaker A: Launched as Haven right back in the day and was actually a very direct Maker competitor and I remember them having a series of really excellent blog posts. That's where I kind of first noticed them, where they really wrote great fundamental analysis about Maker, about basis which then never ended up launching the algorithmic stablecoin and kind of the Haven vision. And I would say those posts, they are still online today and they are still absolutely worth reading.
01:10:27.918 - 01:10:44.682, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So I think that synthetic is actually the first DeFi protocol I invested in. So it goes a long way on this but I think currently synthetics is actually if you look at circulating market cap, it's the number one right now.
01:10:44.682 - 01:11:20.562, Speaker B: If you exclude Chainlink and Rap, Bitcoin and Dai, I mean talk about like non stable crypto asset it's number one right now. And I think that again, I think it's kind of show that in DeFi a lot of the things you can actually consider kind of like alchemy of finance. I mean most people know that I'm a big supporter of synthetics but a lot of the initial skepticism will actually correct in a way that how do you really bootstrap a stable coin or a synthetic asset from their own native token because that in itself is like a circular reasoning.
01:11:20.562 - 01:11:47.050, Speaker B: But I think that what changed my mind is actually reading one of the blog posts of synthetics, actually, that as long as there's value created from these services, the collateral token should be worth something. Because that means that people are actually willing to pay to use those services. And the fee that go to the token holder is what make the synthetics token SNX token valuable.
01:11:47.050 - 01:12:04.738, Speaker B: So I think that in that sense you can think of them as like obviously initially it's nothing but it's just like an early stage equity. The equity is not worth anything. The founder raised it and based on certain future expectations of what they are going to do to make it such in a way that it will be valuable in future.
01:12:04.738 - 01:12:32.874, Speaker B: So I think that's the difference of syntax value model that confounded a lot of people earlier on. So right now SNX in a simple term basically you collateralize SNX token and you can create various synthetic assets and you can trade those synthetics asset around and the fee will go to the SNX token holder that are staking it. So that's the gist of it and they are also the earliest first launch partner.
01:12:32.874 - 01:12:53.518, Speaker B: They're going to partner with optimism, a layer two solution that is using optimistic rob. So I think that they really need the layer two to solve their current gas price issue because interacting in synthetics is the gas price can be very high. So they really need that layer two solution.
01:12:53.518 - 01:13:11.882, Speaker B: But I'll say it's definitely one of the most vibrant and active committee around and that have went through a lot of the different tough times. So that the committee is fairly sticky. I mean, there are some churn here and there even me, myself, I was not as active as I used to be.
01:13:11.882 - 01:13:25.882, Speaker B: But I think that a lot of the bright people are there helping the protocol. And even Kane has delegated some of the responsibility away to the community as well. And their approach on the governance is pretty refreshing.
01:13:25.882 - 01:13:46.274, Speaker B: I think that they think that the pure one coin, one vote model is probably not the most optimal. You lead to a lot of governance apathy and all sorts of issue and the whale calling the shot and the smaller token holder would not feel motivated, which is the correct assessment actually. So they went for a more council model.
01:13:46.274 - 01:14:25.934, Speaker B: So I think that governance is also a refreshing difference between compared to other DeFi protocol and I think that they are definitely one of the most the whole team is very good in execution and fast moving, but I think some of the key challenges is as of right now, the debt pool. Because if you're staking, you're actually taking all the debt pool exposure, which can go up if a lot of the synthetic asset trader is actually profitable. So I think that it's a little bit being in the house and it's always constant process to mitigate this issue.
01:14:25.934 - 01:14:37.030, Speaker B: I think that the next version of the product will be able to largely mitigate this issue. But I think this is probably like an issue. The bigger you get, the more important this issue becomes.
01:14:37.030 - 01:14:40.006, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:14:40.028 - 01:15:13.406, Speaker A: And I think what you said about having a very vibrant community, that kind of goes back to why you wouldn't want to funnel some value to your token holders and have some way that the token benefits from. Basically increased usage of the protocol, which Maker doesn't seem to have, and hence it doesn't have this kind of vibrant community that constantly makes improvements to the project. It's more like a team sitting in an ivory tower compared to synthetics.
01:15:13.406 - 01:15:15.922, Speaker A: And that's what I really like about them.
01:15:16.056 - 01:15:51.834, Speaker C: Yeah, I think synthetics is kind of the darling of composability, right, of ethereum based composability. Because the SNX holders and the SNX developers, the team, they're kind of pioneers in using curve and using curve pool to stabilize SUSD and also using uniswap to synthetic ether versus ether. And funnily enough, if you were LP in the Seth pool, you got an insane amount of uni from the uni AirDrop.
01:15:51.834 - 01:16:01.280, Speaker C: And if you were in the curve pool, you got an insane amount of curve tokens CRV. So I think it kind of.
01:16:04.070 - 01:16:04.386, Speaker B: By.
01:16:04.408 - 01:16:23.542, Speaker C: Having that grassroots community and having that distribution, it enabled them to be really looking out for what other people are doing and seeing how it fits in. And I think understanding that the whole point of Ethereum is that you can compose apps with each other. Right.
01:16:23.542 - 01:17:10.566, Speaker C: The Money Legos concept and I think that the synthetics Staking contract was heavily used the Minter contract rather was heavily used in then later stage DeFi projects that wanted to have a stake and claim concept. And I think, too, the big innovation of synthetics that I also failed to see in the beginning, but you get to see as you start to interact with it more is that when people buy SNX and then they draw SUSD against it and then they trade it for other things, it kind of gets a double beta effect. Right.
01:17:10.566 - 01:17:33.710, Speaker C: You're one, you're long SNX, so you have the DeFi exposure. But then two is like you then use your SUSD to try to beat the pool and you can use your SUSD to farm in DeFi do a whole bunch of things like SUSD because it's arguably the most decentralized stablecoin. It was used in the as the farming token.
01:17:33.710 - 01:17:52.302, Speaker C: It's used in various curve pools. So you own your SNX and then you get a seat at the table, you get what I mean, whereas with Maker, you own Maker and then you vote in things that are irrelevant because you don't have enough Maker anyway to impact anything. And meanwhile you can't do anything with your maker.
01:17:52.302 - 01:18:06.470, Speaker C: You can't borrow against it. You basically own something that's very static whereas when you own SNX, your possibilities are endless. The things you can do with it are endless.
01:18:06.470 - 01:18:16.634, Speaker C: So I think that kind of let people figure out what's cool has worked out very well for them.
01:18:16.752 - 01:18:45.830, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess also notably synthetics is way more centralized than Maker and in fact more than most of the projects that we talked about. And I think for an unfinished project that still has a lot of kinks to work out. And not just kinks, but really fundamental stuff that needs to be solved, which is kind of the stakers taking on exposure to the debt pool, which is, in its current form, very hard to hedge.
01:18:45.830 - 01:19:08.250, Speaker A: And it's really not kind of set and forget, like compound or Aave or uniswap. Right. I think they'll have to figure that out and I think it's good that kind of the governance works the way that it does right now and is not already too decentralized and too ossified in order to make these changes that are necessary.
01:19:08.250 - 01:19:14.570, Speaker A: So should we move on to Yuma?
01:19:15.410 - 01:19:55.946, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, uma is I actually don't have too much thing to say because first of all, I think the DeFi protocol that I have the least understanding in and I think that I also don't really understand how it can attain the current level of market cap because I don't think it's widely used and integrated within the entire DeFi ecosystem. I think they have a synthetic dollar or some of the things that you can do some U farming, you see some traction. But I don't think it's like a super successful I think it has some success, but at the current level of market cap, it's a question mark to me.
01:19:55.946 - 01:20:29.006, Speaker B: That how they attain such a level of market cap and get disturbed by coinbase so quickly. But again, I think that there are synthetic asset approaches the sound in a way that it doesn't take on that much risk compared to the SNX model where you take on a debt risk, all this thing, it's like a collateralized model and then you mean synthetic asset. But I think the key challenges is how do you really boost the liquidity for those synthetic asset? You can do some U farming for it, but the more synthetic asset you have, the harder it is to boost it for liquidity for different synthetic asset.
01:20:29.006 - 01:20:43.722, Speaker B: It's really difficult unless you pay some professional market make it to do it. So I think that's probably the key challenges. How do you go beyond proof of concept phase to being widely used in the entire space? This is the part that I don't really get about.
01:20:43.722 - 01:20:44.540, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:20:45.710 - 01:20:54.222, Speaker A: So sue, do you know how kind of the architecture of humor works in comparison to maker and synthetics? Because I really don't know much about.
01:20:54.276 - 01:21:16.280, Speaker C: It at yeah, like I would say the simplest way to explain it is they have kind of like an auger like system, right, where it's based on instead of using Oracle, you have like a dispute system. So disputers are essentially the ones.
01:21:18.410 - 01:21:18.774, Speaker A: Who.
01:21:18.812 - 01:22:00.210, Speaker C: Are making sure that contracts get settled properly and things like that. And I've had a lot of problems wrapping my head around how that will work in practice, I get the appeal of it from a construction perspective because you get some nice no arbitrage if you get some nice no arbitrage assumptions, then it should resolve nicely. But I think the game theory of it to me is something that because I consider myself quite an adversarial thinker and I do sometimes wonder how it'll look if there's collusion.
01:22:00.210 - 01:22:21.386, Speaker C: You could in theory when it's near a big liquidation, you could have disputes, you could have spam disputes that last like 4 hours while it's at the pin, right, it's at the liquidation price. And then you kind of wonder what will happen. There's all these attack vectors that are very hard to reason about.
01:22:21.386 - 01:22:56.020, Speaker C: I think first wave DeFi, you kind of saw people like, okay, if it's audited, then I ape in, right? And then now they're saying like, okay, it can have five audits and it can still be wrecked by not smart contract design, but by crypto economic design. Right. And now people are realizing even if your crypto economic design is correct, do you have the market forces? Do you understand the market itself well enough, right? Do you understand game? Like, I think Uma is a good team.
01:22:56.020 - 01:23:17.290, Speaker C: They have a promising idea, but these are the tough questions. And they're really tough in the sense that you may never know the answer until there's a big enough bounty. Because let's say I know how to exploit something, I obviously won't do it unless there's enough money, right? That would be the same with any of these kind of constructions.
01:23:17.290 - 01:23:37.390, Speaker C: That kind of Thanksgiving turkey effect is the biggest challenge for any sort of radical new way of trying to solve an issue or trying to say that you don't need oracles or you don't need that. I think these are very tough questions to actually say you've solved.
01:23:39.090 - 01:23:47.890, Speaker A: Okay, that's all for today. Please come back next week where we discuss the second half of the DeFi top 20 with sue and Arthur X. Goodbye.
