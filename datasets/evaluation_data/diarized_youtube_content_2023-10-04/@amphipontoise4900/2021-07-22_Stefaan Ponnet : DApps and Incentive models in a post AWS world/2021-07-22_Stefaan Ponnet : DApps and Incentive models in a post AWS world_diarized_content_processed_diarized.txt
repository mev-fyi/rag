00:00:21.800 - 00:00:48.916, Speaker A: You. All right. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for attending my talk. I know it's 30 degrees outside and it's very hot, so it takes some effort to come over here. So thanks for that. In this talk, I'm going to give a little status update on what we are doing at the AVADO project and talk a little bit about our incentive models with regards to that.
00:00:48.916 - 00:01:13.080, Speaker A: So, first a few words about myself. So. My name is Stefan. I'm the co founder of AVADO and also the CTO. I've been into the crypto space since 2015, mostly involved with all kinds of Ethereum projects. My first main project on Ethereum was Swarm City Project, which started in 2016. And then from 2018 onwards, I'm involved in AVADO.
00:01:13.080 - 00:02:15.116, Speaker A: My skills on these projects are the programming aspect and everything that's software related. So to understand where we are coming from with AVADO, I'm just going to give you a little background on different computing models and how these evolved. So first is just to get an understanding where we are and why are we doing this. So when we look at the beginning, it's not actually the very first beginning, but like the we had these mainframes which allowed new types of applications to appear. In this case were bulk data, processing of data. Then if we fast forward another ten to 15 years, you had the personal computer that arose with desktop applications, which was then like the new thing. Then again, fast forward another ten years, we had the internet with email search and other applications, and then we saw the democratization of the exchange of information so that all of a sudden that became accessible to anybody.
00:02:15.116 - 00:03:47.004, Speaker A: And then shortly thereafter we had the emergence of the smartphone. And then with all these sensors, it also enabled another new class of applications like services like Uber navigation apps and social media apps with cameras, et cetera. So we see a trend that each ten to 15 years there's like a whole new computing model that emerges that allows new classes of applications to be created and they built on these unique strengths of the platform. So if we correlate that to our own community, we see that in again fast forward another ten years, around 2010, the emergence of blockchain with as unique value proposition, the direct exchange and store of value or the democratization of exchange of value. And if we fast forward another approximately ten years, it's more like five to ten years, we see a whole new explosion of DApps and layer two, like DEXes side chains, bridges, decentralized finance with the open finance concepts and Staking. There's also a lot of new peer to peer protocols emerging, like Swarm IPFS hopper is also one that we support Tornado, Cash and others which bring new incentives to this space. Now, the question that a lot of people have is how can I participate in those, how can I contribute? And also how can I benefit from these things and that sort of inspired us to build this platform.
00:03:47.004 - 00:04:11.232, Speaker A: So, AVADO, we started in 2018. We are creating and selling these boxes. So I took one here just to give you an idea what it is. And it's a very convenient way to participate in these blockchain protocols. So this is just a regular computer. So it just has a regular CPU, Ram and SSD storage in it. So it's really plug and play.
00:04:11.232 - 00:04:31.016, Speaker A: So it comes pre installed. If you buy it, you just plug it in into your router. It starts working. It has a WiFi access point. You can also remotely dial into it through a VPN. And when you are connected to the WiFi, then you can access the DAP store. So this is a curated list of DApps that you can run on the platform.
00:04:31.016 - 00:05:15.464, Speaker A: So this is something that we create and offer to our users. And we have this no CLI approach. So we think that it should be possible for anybody to participate without even touching the command line. So you don't need these technical skills to do that. Let me first, since we're doing this for two and a half years, give you a couple of insights or learnings and observations that we had after doing that. So some of these might be obvious for you guys and some were even interesting for us to see. So, first observations, that our kind of users, they don't want to spend the time in looking and investigating the right hardware to use.
00:05:15.464 - 00:05:53.620, Speaker A: So that's why we create our own hardware. So one of the features, so it has a fanless design, so it's completely silent. So it conveniently fits your house, like on your desk or wherever you want to put it. It has this recognizable branding and it comes in different flavors. We have different SSD and memory configurations at different price points. Second observation is that users don't want to read manuals. So if you look at a lot of blockchain projects, they first have like a home page and then they almost immediately direct you to a documentation site where you have all the developer documentation, SDKs, whatnot.
00:05:53.620 - 00:06:30.290, Speaker A: But most people are not per se interested in that kind of thing. They just want to see how can I run it, how can I participate, how can I get started? So that's why we create more easy to consume content. We have a YouTube channel that has all kinds of explainers. So almost each package that we support has its own video there. We also have like unboxing videos, how to get started and so forth. So whole walkthroughs through all these applications, which makes life easier for people. And another thing which amazed us a bit is that in practice, people don't really care about decentralization either.
00:06:30.290 - 00:07:12.780, Speaker A: They more care about the convenience. So decentralization is not a goal as such, it is a means to an end. So that's why we say, okay, we are going to have what we call a trust minimized technology stack. So even though we distribute our DApps over IPFS, so that part is decentralized. The curation of our store currently is centralized because we support it and we curate this. So we have these categories which makes it easy to find. You have like featured DApps for example, you have categories for smart mining, so things that return you some coins for running it, blockchain nodes themselves and so forth.
00:07:12.780 - 00:08:07.192, Speaker A: Another thing is that users, they are scared of the command line interface. So what we are doing with that is that we are creating onboarding wizards. So for each of these packages that would normally involve downloading software on your computer and running something on the CLI, we are wrapping those in a web UI and integrating them into the avalo user interface. So for none of the DAPs that you want to run, do you need any command line tools? Also the dependencies are already considered and taken care of. So for example, if you want to stake on E two then not only do you need to run the validator client, but you also need to run the beacon chain. And to run the beacon chain you also need to run a known Ethereum node. So if you just install the validator client it automatically knows that you also need these other two dependencies and they're automatically installed.
00:08:07.192 - 00:09:04.496, Speaker A: And as you can see here on the screenshot, there's also backup and restore of the crucial app data within the UI. So one of the things that we did, for example for Ethereum Two is that we created a key generation package. I don't know if you already are involved into staking on e two. Normally you need to go to the launchpad website, then you need to download a specific piece of software to generate your keys and so forth. We wrapped all that in a package so you don't have to actually go ahead and do that. And as you can see so here and there in my presentation I added some tweets from users that really confirmed that they like this approach. And one other thing is that we see that it's very important for users sort of to hold their hand so they want to have confirmation because even if you're staking eat, no matter how rich you are, I think 32 eat is still a significant amount of money for everybody.
00:09:04.496 - 00:09:56.204, Speaker A: So if you want to start doing that, you only do this one time but it involves a lot of money. So either you want to have some confirmation from somebody else that you're doing the right thing or you just want to have somebody to hold your hand for you to just guide you through the process and make sure you don't make any mistakes in the process. And that's why we have sort of an always on support through different channels and I will talk more about that we also are very proud to have a very welcoming community from AVADO. Now, my talk is supposed to be about incentive models, not about the AVADO in general. So let's talk a little bit about those. So in the AVADO in general, we have four ways that people can benefit from the AVADO and actually earn something back. So the first one is sharing your resources.
00:09:56.204 - 00:10:47.516, Speaker A: Since you've purchased a device like a computer that sits in your house next to your router, you have a device that's 24, that's 24/7 on. So that means you have like CPU, you have disk space available and you have bandwidth at your disposal. So there are different applications that take use of that. And if you just donate bandwidth, if you donate disk space or do some calculations for it, then you gain some tokens senkative staking, which is obvious, sharing your AVADO native resources and also providing user support. So let's talk a little bit about those four aspects. So, if you want to participate in peer to peer protocols, currently we have these options which earn you tokens for running a DAP. So for example, the Mysterium network allows you to turn your AVADO into an endpoint for VPN traffic.
00:10:47.516 - 00:11:28.604, Speaker A: So they all have a whitelisting policy and so forth to make sure you're doing nothing illegal on your AVADO. But this is a way. So here you donate your bandwidth in exchange for tokens. The Hopper network is also a privacy messaging protocol and then Swarm probably doesn't need any introduction. Also communication and file storage platform and then Tornado cache is also privacy solution for Ethereum. And you can participate with your AVADO by running a relayer and I will also explain that in more detail further on. Second possibility is to stake.
00:11:28.604 - 00:12:15.196, Speaker A: So we currently support two different chains. First is Ethereum two, so you can run an E two validator on your AVADO and we also support the avalanche network. Now, the big difference between staking with your own hardware and staking through a provider like an Exchange for example, is that with the AVADO you will have 100% of the rewards for yourself. It's also a noncustodial solution. So you're running everything yourself, so you're not depending on anybody else to run software for you. And also it's the way it's supposed to be. So the whole idea of blockchain is that people will participate in this and run this software at home.
00:12:15.196 - 00:12:44.616, Speaker A: And this is what we are enabling. We're also doing the same thing for the avalanche network. So both of these, of course they require a stake, which is different to the other type of incentives that we had. The other ones, they don't require a stake, they just pay you for sharing your resources. The third possibility is to share your AVADO native resources. So there you can earn tokens by sharing. This is something we are still setting up.
00:12:44.616 - 00:13:28.256, Speaker A: Some of these are already live and some of these things are in development. So, as you can see here, so we dubbed it a Rio Cloud. Rio is for run your own where all the resources that are on your Avalo. So all the software that is running, which has the potential to share it with somebody else, you can just flick a switch and then you start sharing them with other people. So you can share your IPFS nodes, also your Ethereum nodes, and in a later stage also your beacon chain, for example, so that other people can use that to run their validator. This is a dashboard that we have for the different pools. So here on the left side you see our Tornado cache relayer pool.
00:13:28.256 - 00:14:24.600, Speaker A: So the way that it works is that if you enable the sharing of your Tornado cache relayer, we will pull it together in this list and we'll create a load balancer that just has one endpoint that you see there on the top and it is also listed on the UI of Tornado cache. So if people use a relayer, it might be that they bump into one of these currently 27 active back end nodes and we do the same thing for Ethereum, RPC and so forth. So I think you get the idea. And then the last part I want to talk about is the democratization of our support. So we are trying to create some sort of a flywheel of support and it works very well. And that's why I also want to explain a little bit how we do it. So what we do for each avatar that we sell, we put a certain percentage of our gains into a support budget, which is just a die account that we use.
00:14:24.600 - 00:15:11.816, Speaker A: And then we need to have certain people give support. Remember that I said it's important for people to hold their hands. So somebody has to do that. Now there are two questions like who are you going to ask to give the support and how are you going to organize the distribution of the support budget to these people. The way that we did it is so we have all different telegram groups with like one generic telegram group and then each DAP has its own Telegram group. And we introduced a bot, the AVADIN bot, which allows people to say thank you if somebody else helps them. So it means that if you have purchased your Avalo at the beginning, you come to this channel, you say, I have some questions.
00:15:11.816 - 00:15:53.910, Speaker A: Maybe they have a problem setting up their UPnP settings in their router, or maybe they need assistance setting up their Validator and so forth. Somebody helps them, and then later on you can thank them for that. And this bot will track all this activity. And then at the end of the month we do the accounting and we send the support budget to these people. And it's a very interesting concept. So we do it in a super transparent approach. So we have like a public leaderboard, so everybody who receives praise gets it, gets to see it and this encourages other people to also participate in this support.
00:15:53.910 - 00:16:39.572, Speaker A: And also because the bot is only active in the channels that we support, there is a certain social coherence that prevents abuse from that. So we don't need any specific smart contracts for that or anything. So it's just this group that keeps it together and that keeps it in place. So further down on that page of the praises that are given, you can also see why they are giving it. And you can see that also the people involved in this group, they are very happy about it. And these are also the best people that we can imagine that would give support because they have a device themselves. They've also enjoyed already receiving support from somebody else.
00:16:39.572 - 00:17:22.130, Speaker A: So not only are they happy to share their knowledge with other people, but they also get paid for it. So that's very interesting. So to conclude is our hope with AVADO to make using blockchain applications more attractive for a larger audience. So not only for developers, but also people that just want to benefit and profit from these protocols and that we can sort of contribute a bit to more adoption of usability and diversity in this whole ecosystem. So that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Thank you very much. Maybe time for a few questions.
00:17:22.130 - 00:17:25.170, Speaker A: Yes.
00:17:28.200 - 00:17:38.630, Speaker B: I'm curious about the, I guess two parts, the operating system on the actual hardware itself and then how you think about attack surfaces that come from that.
00:17:39.720 - 00:17:41.220, Speaker A: What was the second part of you?
00:17:41.290 - 00:17:51.396, Speaker B: How you think about attack surfaces that come from that? Obviously if you're running an e two node or some sort of node and you have key material on the machine, how is that being handled?
00:17:51.588 - 00:17:56.268, Speaker A: Yeah, first of all, can you repeat your first question as well?
00:17:56.354 - 00:17:57.630, Speaker B: The operating system.
00:17:58.000 - 00:18:54.524, Speaker A: So the base operating system here is just a Linux machine and the overlay on that is based on docker. So that means that you have all kinds of so all these packages are wrapped in a docker container and luckily for us, docker is sort of the industry standard. So a lot of projects already support docker systems and so the system on that is just like managing these docker systems next to each other on your second question. So like the key generation for example, these packages, the purpose of these packages is that you remove them so there's no direct link to first generate the key and then immediately import it. So we force people to download a copy of these keys and then remove the package and only then install the validator client. So you only have to upload the key for your staking. So you have also other keys like the withdrawal keys and so forth and they never touch the device itself.
00:18:54.524 - 00:19:25.620, Speaker A: So that's maybe one part of the answer, maybe second part is that the machine also sits behind to your firewall. So it's basically in your internal network. So you have the protection of your router. And so normally all let's say ports towards the device are closed by default and only those ports that are necessary to run the app. So these peer to peer ports and so forth, they are opened through UPnP. So that's another layer of protection that you have against malicious use. Awesome.
00:19:25.690 - 00:19:26.132, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:19:26.186 - 00:19:34.810, Speaker A: Okay. Any other questions? If not, thank you for your attention again.
