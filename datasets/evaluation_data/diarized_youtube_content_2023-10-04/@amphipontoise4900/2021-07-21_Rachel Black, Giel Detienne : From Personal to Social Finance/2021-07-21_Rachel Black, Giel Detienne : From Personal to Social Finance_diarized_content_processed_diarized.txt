00:00:01.050 - 00:00:01.600, Speaker A: It.
00:00:03.570 - 00:00:33.396, Speaker B: Where'S the clicker? Hi. So today we're going to be talking about from personal to social finance. Before we get into the talk, I'll just do a quick intro.
00:00:33.396 - 00:00:48.676, Speaker B: My name is Rachel. I'm a founder of a project called Good Ghosting, which is a DeFi saving application. I'm also going to be co presenting with my colleague Heal, who's also a founder of Good Ghosting and our kind of in house DeFi Djen.
00:00:48.676 - 00:01:18.176, Speaker B: So we're going to be talking about some trends we're seeing that are kind of moving finance away from being something quite siloed and quite personal to a more exciting and social finance. So, first of all, if you think about traditional finance, it is really pretty much a solitary affair. Like, you have your personal savings account, a pension, an ETF, maybe you have a joint account with your spouse or some accommodation for your immediate family, but it is essentially just for you.
00:01:18.176 - 00:01:30.740, Speaker B: And really, this is just mean. This is how banks work. You sign up as an individual entity, you do your KYC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then you go along like this and it's all bit lonely and a little bit boring, I think, to be honest.
00:01:30.740 - 00:01:48.504, Speaker B: So we can look at some more fun things today. But having said that, of course, in the kind of non DeFi world, there's been quite a number of examples of kind of social finance. And when I was researching this, a couple of things jumped out to me about these examples of social finance.
00:01:48.504 - 00:02:08.512, Speaker B: One, they're often for people who are otherwise cut out of mainstream traditional finance. And two, they often hold like a very important social function as well as just being purely financial vehicles. So the first one is something called rotational savings and credit associations, really popular throughout the world.
00:02:08.512 - 00:02:20.804, Speaker B: They're called like, Tandas in Latin America, I found like, there was over 200 different names that I could find for them when I did a bit of research. So, yeah, huge. Globally, they pretty much operate like this diagram shows.
00:02:20.804 - 00:02:44.952, Speaker B: It's a group of people, everyone puts in some money every month, for example, and then one person receives all of that money and it rotates round until everyone has received a payout. It's got a number of benefits, particularly if you don't have any access to loans. This could be a really great way to kind of get access to that lows risk of inflation and has quite an important social functionality.
00:02:44.952 - 00:03:03.924, Speaker B: I was reading about people who'd emigrated out of Mexico and found like, Tandas in La were a really important touch point for them to kind of connect with community when they're outside of their home country, local currencies. This is the Brixton pound. I'm from London, so I remember this coming out.
00:03:03.924 - 00:03:30.120, Speaker B: It's quite a fun experimentation to kind of increase spend in local areas and circulates more quickly than traditional finance, et cetera, investment clubs. So, of course, since the beginning of time, people have kind of invested in groups, but this has really happened formally from around like the 19 hundreds onwards. And in 1995 there was around 35,000 investment clubs globally.
00:03:30.120 - 00:03:58.752, Speaker B: I imagine it's a lot more than that now. And this photo of some delightful grannies is actually an investment club called the Beardstown Ladies, that they were also finding that they were kind of cut out traditional stockbrokers, weren't taking them very seriously, wasn't really fitting the image of somebody who wanted to invest in the stock market at the time. So they made their own investment club and were meeting up on a monthly basis to do this and they actually got super famous.
00:03:58.752 - 00:04:09.784, Speaker B: They published some books and caught the imagination of a lot of people. But actually in the end, it turns out their results weren't quite as good as they proposed. But it still goes on to this day.
00:04:09.784 - 00:04:34.544, Speaker B: And again, it was feeling like a very important social functionality. It's that kind of meeting up regularly and having a gossip as well as doing some investment there as well. So before we look at some of the trends, just some of the limitations, what has stopped kind of social finance really kind of scaling before now? Well, we can see with Tandas and investment clubs, it's still largely kind of a trust based thing.
00:04:34.544 - 00:04:48.420, Speaker B: You certainly don't want to enter a tandem with people you don't know. It's a quick way to lose money or you don't trust, so it's hard to scale it. There's regulatory issues and still for most people they're kind of reliant on CFI for having that siloed experience.
00:04:48.420 - 00:05:02.104, Speaker B: And we can see here with web .1 to web two, it changed everything in terms of media and consumption, but largely pretty much remained the same with our bank. And of course we have web .3.
00:05:02.104 - 00:05:24.716, Speaker B: So we've got all these new crazy connections. This is not a literal diagram, it's just to show the different connections that are now possible in this kind of web of opportunities. So now I'm going to pass over to Khil who's going to explore some of the trends that are happening at the moment in DeFi that actually facilitating a more social approach to finance and something quite exciting.
00:05:24.828 - 00:05:56.300, Speaker A: Yeah, so thanks for that, Rachel. So, yeah, we see a lot of new opportunities that pop up in DeFi and digitally in a more broad sense. So in online culture, and one of these is the digital identity because at the moment your life is predominantly, especially during lockdown online, you're connected more and in the ethereum space, this means that your wallet can also be considered not only your financial identity, but also your social identity.
00:05:56.300 - 00:06:09.132, Speaker A: You can deduce a lot from it. For instance, we saw the rise of NFTs that can represent all kinds of decisions you make both financially and socially. We, for instance have like the proof of attendance protocol.
00:06:09.132 - 00:06:39.172, Speaker A: So like Poops, of which all of you probably collected a few by now to really prove you were somewhere and attended an event. We also have NFTs representing membership and these might give you exclusive access to certain communities and perks that come with it. And as well from a number of NFTs you can deduce in what projects certain person or a certain wallet address has been involved.
00:06:39.172 - 00:06:58.316, Speaker A: So for instance, whether somebody helps to validate the ethereum network, whether they participate in governance, whether they are a yield farmer or they just like a certain project, maybe donate to it. And that's not all. You can also have a real representation of your investment decisions.
00:06:58.316 - 00:07:41.096, Speaker A: For instance in Uniswap you're issued now an NFT representing your position, which is also tradable if I'm not mistaken and we have all kinds of variants of this. It can also show you like donating to a good cause like this food forest NFT for example, or some more let's say risky investments in all sorts of dog tokens like Woofie is an example from Yearn. But I just want to come to the point that we now have this system in place where you can even consider your wallet a sort of universal login method to access all kinds of applications.
00:07:41.096 - 00:08:14.170, Speaker A: And I think in history there haven't been much times, I think this is the first time you really get to participate in these systems and communities in a way that you are in control. So you can decide whether you want to do it on your own name or you want to rename pseudonymous or anonymous. For instance, many of you might have an ethereum name service name tag, so like a ETH domain coupled to your wallet address which can be used to link either your real identity to it or your nickname you like to use online.
00:08:14.170 - 00:08:31.320, Speaker A: And this can have some real benefits as well. Why? Because this really provides a unique digital fingerprint. We have some experiments going right now where they are trying to give you a credit score based on your on chain activity.
00:08:31.320 - 00:09:02.036, Speaker A: For instance, ARCX, they're developing a DeFi passport which might give you better interest rates or better borrowing conditions in a different project. We also see other projects using this for growth hacking so you might get early access to some content or receive airdrops for instance, like this NFT. Well, this traditional artist who prioritizes compound finance and other DeFi users.
00:09:02.036 - 00:09:18.680, Speaker A: So you can indeed really consider your crypto address a form of digital passport. That's not all, we can even take it one step further. Like currently many of the firms in crypto even hire based on your on chain activity.
00:09:18.680 - 00:09:48.870, Speaker A: So we have on the right side an example of a Dgen score that keeps track of certain activities you take in the DeFi space and many companies, including Delphi Digital but also compound variety of others, use this as an additional metric when hiring. So it can be it's a bit strange to say, but some consider it on par with like a university degree because it really shows you have hands on experience in this industry. You cannot fake it.
00:09:48.870 - 00:10:07.772, Speaker A: Now we have these digital identities, but of course these identities also interact with each other. So we see the rise of a lot of new communities and also tooling related to this. Here is an overview made by Koopa Trupa a while back.
00:10:07.772 - 00:10:33.860, Speaker A: So it's not even up to date anymore. But we have over 100 Dowels currently managing over $10 billion worth of assets, many coming from small contributors who pull their funds for a common cause. You have all kinds of different types of them, but essentially they're all a way to coordinate people and financial resources and some even like to call it group chats turned into businesses.
00:10:33.860 - 00:11:00.332, Speaker A: Recently we also saw the rise of social tokens which are more focused on the creator economy in which people rally around a certain artist or creator and also build communities around that. Now, when it comes to managing the funds within these DAOs or within these decentralized autonomous organizations, there are different approaches. You could take.
00:11:00.332 - 00:11:34.116, Speaker A: For instance, we could look into more community led investment approaches of which Babylon Finance is an example where they use the community and the governance system to vote on where to invest the funds and they share all the proceeds with the people inside the Dao as well. And this way the investing really becomes a social endeavor where you have these group decisions that are taken where to lead a project next. Contrastingly, you have more the traditional approach where you have one core team that decides on where to allocate funds.
00:11:34.116 - 00:11:50.332, Speaker A: This allows them to move a lot more quickly, but they still take into account some input from the community through governance. Like an example of that is Yearn. We saw a lot of different types of DAOs pop up.
00:11:50.332 - 00:12:31.784, Speaker A: Also some more really specialized in investing like Index co op which is curating a different list of DeFi indices or more like traditionally VC venture type of DAOs like the Laos or Flamingo Dao which focuses on investing in NFTs. Now there's one tool I would like to highlight because of course to do this in a trustless and non custodial manner, you have to use some type of tooling. An example of that is Enzyme, which is an on chain asset management protocol which allows you or your community to set up a new investment strategy in a matter of minutes.
00:12:31.784 - 00:12:51.730, Speaker A: Do it all from a multisig or just a regular ethereum account and do it in a transparent and non custodial manner. For instance, you have the unslashed Finance Dao which does it to manage their protocol treasury. You also have Fisis DeFi which is pulling investments from their community through this platform.
00:12:51.730 - 00:13:17.656, Speaker A: There's a bunch of other projects as well which I won't go into detail, but Gnosisave is another example that a lot of communities use to manage their funds. There is one little experiment that's going on right now which is called Coordinate Nape. It's developed by the Yearn team and it's a way to pay out wages within a community or within a company.
00:13:17.656 - 00:13:37.760, Speaker A: So instead of having a top down approach where the executives decide, your wage here is flipped completely upside down. And like every person working together with other persons, they can decide how much they want to contribute to their peers. So the better work you deliver, the more you get paid.
00:13:37.760 - 00:14:13.492, Speaker A: That's a bit the concept behind it and it's used by multiple projects right now, Bankless is using it a few other crypto projects to experiment with this peer to peer gifting and deciding on new ways to earn money. And that's a concept that we see more and more with these interactions, that the concept of earning money gets flipped upside down. So another big theme I want to bring up is a play to earn model, which also depends a lot on social interactions between different players.
00:14:13.492 - 00:14:33.296, Speaker A: So we suddenly saw the rise of, for instance, Xi Infinity. Well, it's not suddenly, it's been a few years in the making, but it was just brought into mainstream attention. There are over half a million players daily using it actively, many from emerging countries like the Philippines where people are actually earning a living with it.
00:14:33.296 - 00:14:55.688, Speaker A: So instead of migrating to the west to come work certain job, they just stay at home. They form these communities and they play the game to earn a living. So they have a scholarship program, for instance, where you can earn money, real money, without spending any money, just have to dedicate time into playing the game.
00:14:55.688 - 00:15:32.852, Speaker A: It's all running on a peer to peer in game economy where the revenue is shared between all the players. So this also blurs the lines a bit between what you're doing digitally, what you're doing in the real world, like what is your job, what is just recreation when it comes to play to earn games? There's also multiple of experiments like Avigatchi, which uses yield generating NFTs and runs on a community owned basis. So it's also a dow in which players can earn quite big sums of money just to complete a game.
00:15:32.852 - 00:15:44.180, Speaker A: For instance, the last rarity farming season had over $2 million worth distributed to the users. So, yeah, I'll bring it back to Rachel.
00:15:44.920 - 00:15:59.150, Speaker B: Cool. So the last theme that we're going to talk about is Gamification. Now, of course, this is a theme just in finance and fintech generally, but I think gamification works a lot better when you put it in a social setting because we're social animals and it's just a lot more fun.
00:15:59.150 - 00:16:18.848, Speaker B: So we can see a great example of this is like Pull Together, which is like the no loss lottery, which really allows you to get quite substantial sums by not actually even buying a lottery ticket and they themselves have moved over to a Dow. So they're kind of going to this socially coordinated there's, combined tickets with pods, all these kind of things. So super exciting.
00:16:18.848 - 00:16:31.332, Speaker B: And then warning, small shill from our project. So we are in the space of Gamified social savings. So Good Ghosting is a social saving pool, basically works like this.
00:16:31.332 - 00:16:48.312, Speaker B: So the pool will run for a fixed amount of time, you make regular deposits into it, we move it somewhere where it's going to generate some extra income. So at the moment we're on Ave on Polygon and then at the end we split the interest amongst everyone who hit those regular savings. It's also sponsored.
00:16:48.312 - 00:16:56.844, Speaker B: We actually did launch a pool yesterday to coincide with ECC. So if you're curious to try it around, you can go to Goodghosting.com and you can check that out.
00:16:56.844 - 00:17:07.856, Speaker B: Yeah, we've incentivized it. So you'll get a minimum of five die if you complete it, but probably more depending on the interest and how many people stay in the game. If you're the last person standing, you'll get a lot.
00:17:07.856 - 00:17:21.748, Speaker B: But we're encouraging users to kind of build better financial habits and doing it in a social setting. So this is our UI. We found out when we did user testing that people are super interested in how other people in the pool are doing.
00:17:21.748 - 00:17:34.410, Speaker B: They really want to know that they're doing well, but they also want to know they're doing better than other people. And I think this speaks to something quite deep in the human psyche. But yeah, we're going to add more Gamification, explore this area as well.
00:17:34.410 - 00:18:00.620, Speaker B: So that's that this is a diagram a community member made for us of how the kind of pool works at a high level. Yeah. And then just in conclusion, so basically looking at all of these themes with your address becoming your online profile, something you can use to get a job, something you can use to get AirDrop, something that's quite dear to you and you can be quite proud of, like tokenized online communities.
00:18:00.620 - 00:18:09.776, Speaker B: Dow is a huge explosion. We've seen in that all of this happening in a composable way, like we build on top of Ave. We don't need to ask permission to do that, anyone can do these things.
00:18:09.776 - 00:18:40.240, Speaker B: So there's so many possibilities open to us and then bringing elements of Gamification into something, into finance, which kind of has been traditionally like by ourselves, a little bit lonely and kind of a little bit stale really. So we're kind of now in this moment where we're all kind of playing this massive kind of online game of DeFi with all these different areas in it, super exciting. It's obviously going to evolve in many ways that we can't see now and I think that is what is exciting about this industry.
00:18:40.240 - 00:18:57.268, Speaker B: Yeah. And then just to kind of round off, just got a couple of quotes which I think kind of can sum up some of the nice sentiment that's available. So, like axie infinity, the web two mindset is if it's successful, the founders make it.
00:18:57.268 - 00:19:04.500, Speaker B: With web three, if it's successful, everyone makes it. So it's a really nice opportunity. And then MetaCartel.
00:19:04.500 - 00:19:18.124, Speaker B: If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. So, yeah, we can go together on this journey of social finance and see what we find. Yeah, that's it.
00:19:18.124 - 00:19:31.170, Speaker B: Feel free to kind of reach out to either myself or Heal on Telegram or follow us on Twitter. We've also got a discord if you want to find out more about Good Ghosting and what we're doing there as well.
00:19:31.620 - 00:19:39.090, Speaker A: Maybe just quickly. The game is limited to 300 people, so if you want to join, it's best to not wait too long.
00:19:39.540 - 00:19:50.570, Speaker B: We got 120 people in it at the moment, so, yeah, jump in and have a mess around with that. You can get a fun future of France NFT as well. But, yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:19:50.570 - 00:19:55.850, Speaker B: I think we've got, like, a minute or two for questions, if anyone has any questions.
00:20:05.800 - 00:20:08.904, Speaker C: Hi. Finally. I meet you.
00:20:08.904 - 00:20:09.768, Speaker C: Nice to meet you.
00:20:09.854 - 00:20:11.144, Speaker B: Nice to meet you.
00:20:11.342 - 00:20:15.460, Speaker C: So, actually, I have a naive question. What happens if everyone is a good Ghost?
00:20:15.620 - 00:20:22.268, Speaker B: If everyone is a good Ghost, well, then it would mean the interest would be split amongst everyone.
00:20:22.354 - 00:20:22.892, Speaker C: Okay.
00:20:23.026 - 00:20:37.600, Speaker B: But it's still a success because everyone's hit their goals. But with the pools we have at the moment, we've actually received some grants and some fundings to incentivize it. So even if everyone saved with Good Ghosting, you would still get more than if you saved by yourself.
00:20:37.600 - 00:20:57.396, Speaker B: Because we have some incentivization, we did run a test, and we had about 200 people doing our closed beta testing, and of those 200, it was just over 200, around 150 completed. So that's kind of the rate that we've seen. It will be interesting to see how that holds up, if that's standard or if there are games where everyone hits.
00:20:57.428 - 00:21:08.580, Speaker A: It and as soon as somebody drops out, you earn more than you would deposit in Aave by yourself, for instance. So if you're a bit motivated, you will come out on top normally.
00:21:08.740 - 00:21:20.220, Speaker B: But we like to make something that you know that if you do that, you can get something out of it. So it's not a case of luck. It's just you have to put in the behavior to save regularly.
00:21:20.580 - 00:21:21.570, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:21:27.780 - 00:21:29.952, Speaker B: Cool. Well, that's no questions. Thank you.
00:21:29.952 - 00:21:31.584, Speaker B: And thank you for having us.
00:21:31.622 - 00:21:32.530, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
00:21:43.620 - 00:21:48.240, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah. Intermittent.
00:21:48.240 - 00:21:49.990, Speaker B: Oh, nice.
