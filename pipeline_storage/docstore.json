a novel dynamic that emerged with\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based block proposer selection protocol. Within\nthis PoS framework, validators acquire a distinct monopoly position during their assigned slots,\ngiven that block proposal rights are set deterministically, contrasting with Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nprotocols. Consequently, validators have the power to delay block proposals, stepping outside the\nhonest validator specs, optimizing potential returns through MEV payments. Nonetheless, this\nstrategic behaviour introduces the risk of orphaning if attestors fail to observe and vote on the block\ntimely. Our quantitative analysis of this waiting phenomenon and its associated risks reveals an\nopportunity for enhanced MEV extraction, exceeding standard protocol rewards, and providing\nsufficient incentives for validators to play the game. Notably, our findings indicate that delayed\nproposals do not always result in orphaning and orphaned blocks are not consistently proposed\nlater than non-orphaned ones.\nTo further examine consensus stability under varying network\nconditions, we adopt an agent-based simulation model tailored for PoS-Ethereum, illustrating that\nconsensus disruption will not be observed unless significant delay strategies are adopted. Ultimately,\nthis research offers valuable insights into the advent of waiting games on Ethereum, providing a\ncomprehensive understanding of trade-offs and potential profits for validators within the blockchain\necosystem.\n2012 ACM Subject Classification Security and privacy \u2192 Economics of security and privacy;\nInformation systems \u2192 Distributed storage\nKeywords and phrases Ethereum, Consensus, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Maximal Extractable Value\n(MEV), Incentives\n1\nIntroduction\nThe blockchain landscape has seen tremendous growth and evolution over the years, with\ninnovative concepts continually emerging to enhance its functionality and efficiency. Ethereum,\na key player in this arena, has recently undergone major upgrades, with the merge1 being the\nmost prevalent, replacing the Proof-of-Work (PoW)-based block proposer selection mechanism\n1 https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/\narXiv:2307.05814v1  [cs.CR]  11 Jul 2023\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "65cbd15f-6c77-48ea-b5f0-03a11fb9cdc9": {"__data__": {"id_": "65cbd15f-6c77-48ea-b5f0-03a11fb9cdc9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "2", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "2\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\nwith a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based one [35, 36]. With this upgrade, Etheruem also introduced\na new consensus protocol Gasper comprising Latest Message Driven Greediest Heaviest\nObserved SubTree (LMD GHOST) for fork-choice and Casper Friendly Finality Gadget\n(FFG) for finality, replacing the longest-chain consensus. Switching to PoS remarkably\nreduced the electricity consumption of the Ethereum blockchain (down by 99.98% according\nto the 2022 report of Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute2) which led to a significant cut down\nin block proposal rewards as consensus participants, known as validators, do not require as\nhigh incentives as PoW-Ethereum miners did. Hence, the validators depend even more on\ntransaction fees and exogenous rewards like Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), then miners\ndid.\nIncentives play an essential role in the evolution of public, permissionless blockchains such\nas Ethereum. Misaligned incentives, however, can lead to a lack of interest in contributing to\na network or, potentially, to profit-seeking attacks, dangering consensus stability [17]. MEV\nhas emerged as a powerful incentive within Ethereum [20], enabling network participants to\ngain profits beyond protocol rewards through strategic transaction issuance and ordering [46].\nIn particular, participants who partake in MEV extraction employ transaction ordering\ntechniques inspired by traditional finance to execute profitable strategies based on the\nnetwork state concerning pending transactions in the mempool and the most recently finalized\nblockchain state [30]. The prominence of MEV has risen with the advent of Decentralised\nFinance (DeFi) ecosystem, as shown by the emergence of sophisticated bots exploiting MEV\nopportunities, regardless of their potential disruption to users [20].\nCurrently, the PoS-Ethereum protocol allows validators to release their block in a 12\nseconds slot time, during which the designated validator has a total monopoly on the block\nrelease. This feature introduces new opportunities for MEV extraction through strategic\nwaiting games. To illustrate, we hypothesize that the block proposer may exploit their\nmonopolistic position and wait as long as possible within the slot limits to release the block\nin order to extract additional MEV. However, if a large proportion of validators on the\nEthereum network engage in these delayed releases, it could result in instability within the\nconsensus of the network, as delays in block release may lead to multiple forked blocks.\nThus, this paper delves into the impact of delayed block releases, or more broadly, waiting\ngames, on the Ethereum consensus framework. We primarily focus on answering three pivotal\nresearch questions:\n1. Are waiting games profitable for validators, considering the dynamics of value evolution\nduring a slot time and the relative importance of MEV rewards compared to proposal\nrewards from the consensus layer?\n2. Can validators engage in waiting games without risking their blocks being vulnerable to\ngetting orphaned?\n3. Could waiting games potentially disrupt the stability of Ethereum consensus and, if so,\nunder which conditions?\n1.1\nRelated Work\nAs far as we are aware, [33] is the sole study exclusively focusing on waiting or timing games\nin PoS-Ethereum, although [39] also notes a positive correlation between bid arrival time and\nvalue, while exploring the intricate details about the block construction market available on\nEthereum, MEV-Boost [3].

Despite noting that\ntiming games are worthwhile, they find these strategies not currently being exploited by\nconsensus participants. However, drawing attention to the differences between our study\nand that of the authors in [33] is critical. While we also analyze the value of time, we\nfurther investigate the importance of MEV rewards relative to consensus layer proposal\nrewards and examine unrealised values due to validators\u2019 acting prematurely, not capturing\nthe maximum payments by the builders. Additionally, we assess attestations concerning\nforking vulnerability and explore the connection between orphaned blocks and the timing\nof their winning bids, determining if orphaned blocks arrive later than others or if there\nare non-orphaned blocks with later submitted winning bids. This comprehensive inspection\nprovides deeper insights into the value and significance of waiting games and the associated\nrisks.\nTo test the waiting games under different network conditions, we adopt an Agent-Based\nModel (ABM) specifically devised for PoS-Ethereum by [26]. In particular, studying the\nimpact of waiting games on the Ethereum consensus requires a robust model to examine how\ndifferent waiting strategies influence the consensus properties. Moreover, latency plays an\nessential role in defining consensus. Therefore, the ABM model from [26] is ideal as the model\nexplicitly includes variables for the topology of the peer-to-peer network, and of particular\ninterest, the average block and attestation latencies. Furthermore, the ABM provides specific\ntechniques for accurately measuring the consensus of the simulated PoS-Ethereum network.\n1.2\nContribution\nThis work delivers the following contributions:\n1.

Next, we delve into the concept of Maximal\nExtractable Value (MEV), an additional profit that network participants can capture through\ncertain strategies employed during block production, which forms a crucial aspect of our\nresearch. Lastly, we present the Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS)-the separation of the\nroles in block production to proposers (validators) and builders (who construct blocks)-to\nmitigate the risks associated with MEV centralization around the consensus layer.\n2.1\nPoS-Ethereum Consensus\nThe Ethereum network is a peer-to-peer network that operates in a decentralised manner and\ncomprises nodes (computers or servers) that maintain a copy of the blockchain. Moreover,\nthe nodes can offer varying functionalities, such as full nodes or light nodes. However, certain\nnodes perform a specific role as validators, incentivised by reward mechanisms. Proof-of-Stake\n(PoS) is a blockchain mechanism used to select the next block proposer in a Sybil attack-\nresistant manner. In PoS, network members who wish to participate in block production\nmust stake money to the protocol, and unlike PoW, there is no need for participants to\nsolve a complex puzzle or use mining hardware. Instead, participants have a financial stake\nthat can be slashed in case of misbehaviour. This makes PoS chains more energy-efficient\ncompared to PoW chains.\nIn the PoS-Ethereum consensus, validators are participants involved in the consensus\nprocess. Validators need to deposit a stake as collateral (32 Ether) to the deposit contract,\nwhich contains a Merkle root for all deposits.\nIn addition, validators are required to\nmaintain a node that facilitates communication and message exchange within the gossip\nnetwork. Validators are incentivised by the rewards they receive for honest conduct, thereby\ncompensating them for their associated costs. The protocol randomly selects a validator\nto propose a block. If a validator misbehaves (e.g. proposes multiple blocks in one slot),\nthe respective validator gets penalised (i.e. stake slashed). Additionally, a committee of\nvalidators is chosen at every slot to vote on the validity of the proposed block. At least\ntwo third of the committee must agree for the block to be considered valid. Validators who\nsubmit contradicting votes are penalised. The PoS-Ethereum protocol divides time into\nepochs and slots, with each epoch containing 32 slots and each slot lasting 12 seconds. In\nPoS-Ethereum, a block is considered finalised after two epochs.\nValidators in Ethereum use the LMD GHOST [34] fork choice rule to establish the\ncanonical chain and accurately propose or attest to blocks. Under this framework, validators\nmaintain a record of the latest message received from all other validators and only update it\nif the new vote comes from a slot strictly later than the existing entry. Therefore, in the\nevent that a validator receives two equivocating votes from the same validator for the same\nslot, only the vote that arrives first is taken into consideration. The consensus mechanism\noperates in two phases. In the first phase, LMD GHOST operates on a smaller time scale,\nwith time segments referred to as slots. In the second phase, Casper FFG [16] operates\non a larger time scale, within epochs composed of 32 slots. Specifically, Casper FFG is a\nleaderless, two-phase propose-and-vote-style Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol that\nfunctions to finalise blocks and ensure security even during temporary network partitions.\nThe confirmation rule at the Casper FFG level involves outputting the most recent finalised\nblock and its prefix.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "471d0e40-8618-481b-8d38-69aebb063280": {"__data__": {"id_": "471d0e40-8618-481b-8d38-69aebb063280", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "5", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B. Kraner, N. Vallarano, B.S. Kruger, F. Matthes, and C.J.Tessone\n5\n2.2\nReward structure\nIn the post-merge Ethereum, there have been considerable changes in the reward structure.\nThis paper provides a brief overview of these changes while directing interested readers to [19]\nfor more detailed information. Validators earn rewards by casting votes that align with the\nmajority of the other validators (i.e. honest interaction), specifically when proposing blocks\nand participating in syncing committees [2]. Moreover, validators receive rewards for attesting\nand proposing blocks on time (e.g. attestation rewards). As a result, the network reaches a\nconsensus and validates the data in the blockchain (i.e. finalisation). Block proposers receive\nan aggregated reward of the Gas Tips (i.e. the fees users pay to prioritise their transactions)\nincluded in a block. On the other hand, the value of the attestation rewards for each epoch\nis calculated based on a Base_Reward, which functions as the fundamental unit for the\nother rewards. The Base_Reward is determined by the validator\u2019s effective balance and\nthe total number of active validators and represents the average reward that a validator can\nreceive per epoch when operating under optimal conditions. Specifically, the calculation\nentails dividing the product of the validator\u2019s effective balance and a Base_Reward_Factor\nby the square root of the total active balance, as shown in Equation 1:\nBase_Reward = Effective_Balance \u00d7 Base_Reward_Factor\n\u221aActive_Balance\n(1)\nWhere the Effective_Balance is the effective balance of the attesting validator and\nthe Active_Balance is the total active balance staked across all active validators, and the\nBase_Reward_Factor is a constant of value 64. Therefore, the Base_Reward is propor-\ntional to the effective balance of the validator and inversely proportional to the number of\nvalidators present. Accordingly, as the number of validators in the network increases, the\nrewards are distributed among more validators, which decreases the rewards per validator.\nMoreover, validators are rewarded based on the correctness of their behaviour. Specifically,\nthe attestation reward is influenced by the Flag_Reward [19], shown in:\nFlag_Reward =\nFlag_Weight\nWeight_Denom \u00d7 Base_Reward \u00d7 Attestation_Balance\nActive_Balance\n(2)\nWhere Flag_Weight and Weight_Denom are constants that vary between flags, and\nthe Attestation_Balance is the sum of the effective balances of all attesting validators.\nAccordingly, the Attestation_Reward is the sum of the flag rewards (P Flag_Reward).\nIn addition, sync rewards and block proposal rewards form part of the reward structure.\nThe former is a reward for validators that participate in the sync committee to sign new\nblock headers in every slot. The latter are the rewards linked to proposing a beacon block.\nSpecifically, the reward consists of including the attestation aggregations from validator votes\nnot yet present in the beacon chain and including sync aggregates. Moreover, the block\nproposer is responsible for including the aggregate from the sync committee participants [19].\n2.3\nMaximal Extractable Value\nThe concept of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has grown significantly within the\nEthereum blockchain, particularly with the surge of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) domain\nsince 2020 [46]. Daian et al. [20] initially coined the term Miner Extractable Value, implying\nthe additional value that miners, or privileged actors, could seize by manipulating transaction\nsets and order in a block, beyond standard protocol incentives such as block rewards and\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "cafb477e-7048-42b3-ba0e-744236d64a53": {"__data__": {"id_": "cafb477e-7048-42b3-ba0e-744236d64a53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "6", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "6\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\ntransaction fees [20]. Despite these privileged actors having a position of power, this value is\nalso available to any network participant who can observe the confirmed blockchain state\nand monitor pending transactions. Consequently, the Miner or Privileged Extractable Value\nforms a subset of Maximal Extractable Value, which includes any value that can be extracted\nwithin a blockchain network [30].\nTo exploit MEV, network participants who do not possess authority over block content\nmust influence the transaction order by offering payments to block proposers. These payments\ncan be transaction fees or direct payments facilitated by MEV markets such as Flashbots\nAuction [10]. Participants seeking MEV, known as MEV searchers, employ transaction\nordering techniques inspired by traditional finance, such as frontrunning and backrunning\n[22, 38, 45], and DeFi instruments like flash loans [31], to execute profitable strategies based\non the network state concerning pending transactions in the mempool [45] and the most\nrecently confirmed blockchain state [44].\nExisting research [30, 41] and web services such as MEV Explore [7] or EigenPhi [6]\nthat quantify the extracted MEV on Ethereum are limited by their heuristic approaches to\ndetecting certain MEV patterns (e.g., arbitrages, sandwiches, liquidations) and the protocols\nthey inspect. Consequently, they only provide a lower-bound estimate of the actual value\nextracted. According to MEX Explore [7], more than $675 million worth of MEV had been\nharnessed until the merge in September 2022. Furthermore, data from EigenPhi shows\nongoing MEV extraction, with approximately $9.5 million in profit generated within a month\nfrom May 2023 to June 2023 [6]. Although a lower-bound, these estimates already highlight\nthe significance of MEV as a powerful incentive on Ethereum, emphasizing its consideration\nin design decisions to prevent consensus destabilizing attacks [17, 28, 32].\nMEV\u2019s negative implications are manifold [42], with issues including user value loss,\nnetwork congestion due to MEV searchers competing [20], value disparities among blocks\nincentivising consensus destabilising attacks [17], and centralisation of MEV supply chain\ncomponents due to economies of scale [37]. In response, innovative solutions are emerging\nacross different system layers [42]. These include fair transaction ordering protocols [13, 25],\nprivacy-preserving mechanisms to protect valuable transaction information of users [8, 24, 43],\nefficient MEV extraction designs that facilitate flow across different stakeholders [11, 23],\nand MEV-aware applications providing user rebates [1, 4, 8]. For a comprehensive analysis\nof the MEV mitigation space and existing solutions, we refer the reader to [42].\n2.4\nProposer-Builder Separation and MEV-Boost\nProposer-Builder Separation (PBS) is a novel design concept introduced for Ethereum\nto address the potential risk of validators becoming excessively sophisticated in block\nconstruction [14, 15]. This approach introduces a clear division of tasks within the block\nproduction process, assigning separate roles to proposers and builders. The core responsibility\nof the proposer revolves around consensus participation, while the intricate task of block\nconstruction is outsourced to specialised builders. By integrating PBS into Ethereum\u2019s core\nprotocol, validators can function solely as consensus nodes and source the execution payload\nfrom the builder\u2019s market on the execution layer. This enables validators to profit from\nMEV available in the mempool without direct involvement in the complexities of block\nbuilding. This shifts the competition for MEV and its inherent centralising influences from\nthe validator level, closely related to the consensus layer, to the builder level, primarily\nassociated with the execution layer.\nWithin the framework of PBS, builders are involved in a competitive environment where\nthey strive to offer the maximum value to proposers. Their bidding capacity depends on\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "2f6e5142-3027-4166-b74f-321695fb5843": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f6e5142-3027-4166-b74f-321695fb5843", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "7", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B.

Determining the optimal set of transactions or bundles that yield the\nhighest value necessitates using complex algorithms, which may consume significant energy\nresources. Builders willingly undergo this computational cost to secure a monopoly over a\nsingle slot duration without engaging in staking or, previously, mining activities as consensus\nparticipants do.\nYet, the successful integration of PBS into the Ethereum core protocol relies on addressing\nthe complexities surrounding trust assumptions and commitments between proposers and\nbuilders [27]. As a temporary PBS solution, Flashbots introduced MEV-Boost [11], which\nemploys relays [12] as intermediaries between proposers and builders. Relays gather blocks\nfrom builders in the form of bids, validate them, and present them to proposers. Consequently,\nthey function as a data availability layer, safeguarding proposers from Denial-of-Service\n(DoS) attacks stemming from excessive bid submissions.\nWhile PBS aims to counteract the centralising impacts of MEV, MEV-Boost leads to\nnew censorship-related risks, as relays could selectively withhold bids from certain builders\nto specific proposers. However, in the absence of reliable relays, proposers can turn to their\nexecution clients for local block building. Hence, in the MEV-Boost architecture, relay\ncompetition promotes honest behaviour as their activities are subject to public auditability.\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of MEV-Boost [3] is designed around three key players:\nvalidators, who control the proposers, relays, and builders, who prepare the execution\npayloads. To qualify for receiving execution payloads from builders, validators need to\nregister with their chosen relays and provide details such as the payment address, block gas\nlimit, and their public key [12]. The block proposal process then unfolds as follows, when a\nvalidator is scheduled to propose a block [5, 33]:\n1. Builders, beginning from the preceding slot, check if the validator for the forthcoming\nslot is registered with a relay they submit bids to. If so, they start assembling execution\npayloads using transactions from the public mempool and their private order flow, if it\nexists.\n2. Builders then forward the prepared execution payload, along with their bid for the\nvalidator, to the relays they work with.\n3. Once the relays receive the submitted payloads, they validate them and make them\navailable for the validator.\n4. The validator\u2019s MEV-Boost middleware collects headers and associated bids from the\nregistered relays and provides the validator with the header offering the highest value.\n5. The validator blindly signs the header and sends it back to the MEV-Boost middleware,\nwhich forwards it to the relevant relay.\n6. The relay then verifies the validator\u2019s signature on the signed header and propagates the\ncomplete block to the rest of the network.\nMEV-Boost Analytics\nFollowing the merge in September 2022, MEV-Boost has risen to\nprominence as the primary solution for validators\u2019 block production. Analysis and data\npresented in [9, 39, 40] clearly showcase the widespread adoption of MEV-Boost among\nblock proposers. As of November 2022, the proportion of blocks produced by MEV-Boost\nutilising validators persistently exceeds 85%, even peaking beyond 90% by June 2023 [40].\nThe remaining validators presumably depend on local block construction via their execution\nclients.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "7f3fb5fd-0ab8-4426-b2ca-f44cee7d85ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f3fb5fd-0ab8-4426-b2ca-f44cee7d85ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "8", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "8\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\nThe adoption of MEV-Boost has triggered substantial compensations for validators,\nsurpassing an aggregate of 215k ETH [40].\nHowever, it is important to note that the\nMEV-Boost ecosystem has exhibited a degree of centralisation. Presently, ten active relays\nparticipate in MEV-Boost, with Ultra Sound Relay, Flashbots, Agnostic, and BloXRoute Max\nProfit contributing significantly to the block production, constituting 32%, 25%, 17%, and\n10% respectively [40]. This centralisation around specific relays can be attributed to the\npositive reputation and trust placed in these relays by both builders and validators.\nAdditionally, a centralisation trend is evident within the builder market as well. Four\nleading block builders-Flashbots, Beaverbuild, Builder0x69, and rsync-build-cumulatively\naccount for nearly 75% of all MEV-Boost blocks [40]. This pattern suggests that certain\nbuilders may have access to exclusive order flow in addition to the transactions available in\nthe public mempool.\n3\nData Collection and Processing\nTo comprehensively analyse the impact of waiting times on the value accrued by proposers,\nattestations, and consensus stability, we collected data from the MEV-Boost protocol and the\nEthereum consensus layer. Our methodology involved leveraging the public data endpoints\npresented by the MEV-Boost relays, which furnish information regarding submitted builder\nbids3 and proposed blocks4. Our data extraction process primarily focused on three dominant\nrelays [40]: Ultra Sound, Flashbots5, and Agnostic. Specifically, we procured bid and proposed\nblock data covering a slot range from 6 087 501 to 6 100 000, constituting 12,500 slots during\nthe time frame of March 27 to 28, 2023.\nTo fetch the consensus-related data such as\nattestations, forked blocks, and consensus rewards, we utilised the API endpoints provided\nby beaconcha.in6.\nWe leveraged the builder overview found in mevboost.pics7 to identify the builders.\nNotably, some builders adopt a strategy to submit identical bids (those with matching block\nhash and value) repetitively until the conclusion of the block auction. Builders are also\nobserved to be submitting the same bid to multiple relays to enhance their selection likelihood.\nWe aimed to pinpoint unique bids in our time-based bid value analysis, which necessitated\nthe removal of duplicates within a single relay and across multiple relays. For each relay, the\narrival time of a bid was identified by its first appearance, and we disregarded subsequent\nduplications from the same builder for the same slot. When aggregating bids across all relays,\nthe earliest bid from any relay was considered to be the first, thereby indicating the initial\ncontribution of a particular bid.\nAcross the range of all analysed slots, we discovered an average of 81, 119, and 47 duplicate\nbids per slot submitted to Agnostic, Ultra Sound, and Flashbots, respectively, resulting in an\noverall average of 83 duplicates. The sheer volume of submissions-with each relay receiving an\naverage of 647 bids per slot-underscored the necessity for accurate identification and removal\nof these duplicate bids, a step critical to upholding the accuracy of our results.

While honest validator specs compliance would require\nproposing a block immediately at the slot\u2019s beginning (at 0ms), a positive correlation between\nvalue and time may motivate rational proposers to postpone their block proposal. This\nsection delves into the exploration of value of time and scrutinises the significance of MEV\nrewards in comparison to proposal rewards from consensus. The goal is to assess whether\nthe strategic delay in block proposals provides a substantial advantage.\n4.1.1\nThe Evolution of Value over Time\nIn order to comprehend the potential value of delay for proposers, we have tracked the bids\nsubmitted across the three relays under consideration: Ultra Sound, Flashbots, and Agnostic.\nInitially, we consider all distinct builder bids submitted across these relays, aggregating them\nfor slot 6 093 815. Figure 1 dissects the distribution of bids, which are represented as dots\nand colour-coded based on the submitting builder. The relation between their arrival time at\nthe relay and their associated value is examined. The study uncovers a distinct upward trend\nin bid values over time. It is important to note that we measure the arrival time relative to\nthe start time of the slot; therefore, any negative time value indicates that the bid arrived\nduring the previous slot. With this in mind, the earliest recorded bid arrived at -10905ms\nwith a value of 0.014 ETH. On the other hand, the winning bid chosen at 299ms had a\nmuch higher value of 0.046 ETH. This represents a substantial increase of approximately\n228% from the initial bid, demonstrating the significant potential advantages of waiting.\nIt is observed that different builders adopt distinct strategies, such as Flashbots builders\nsubmitting approximately every 0.5s since the start time of the previous slot, in contrast to\nrsync-builder.xyz or Bob the Builder, who only commence submissions after a specific point\nin time.\nThis increase in value is attributable to the expanding public transaction pool, and\npotentially private order flow, that builders observe over time. As new transactions and\nbundles are successively submitted by regular users and MEV searchers, builders have access\nto a larger set of opportunities from which to construct their blocks. As a result, they can\noffer increased value to the validators. The escalating number of transactions included in the\nbuilder blocks, as demonstrated in Figure 2, further substantiates this.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "d9459d85-6856-4428-a253-f27b1e7f3b94": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9459d85-6856-4428-a253-f27b1e7f3b94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "10", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "10\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\n-10000\n-9000\n-8000\n-7000\n-6000\n-5000\n-4000\n-3000\n-2000\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\nBuilder Block Arrival Time (ms)\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\nBlock Bid (ETH)\nunknown\nFlashbots\nbeaverbuild.org\nbuilder0x69\nrsync-builder.xyz\nTitan Builder\nBloXroute\nBuildAI\nhttps://eth-builder.com\nlightspeedbuilder.info\nBob the builder\nnfactorial.xyz\nIt's Free Real Estate\nGambit Labs\nWinner Bid (builder0x69, 0.046 ETH)\nSlot Start\nFigure 1 The distribution of unique builder blocks, based on their arrival time to the relay and\ntheir corresponding bid value, which were submitted by builders for slot 6 093 815.

To\naccurately capture value progression, we residualized the bid values against slot and builder\nfixed effects, which might cause artificial value fluctuations due to high or low MEV regimes,\nas discussed in [33]. Following this, we performed a linear regression on these residualized\nbid values relative to time, revealing a positive marginal value of 5.71 \u00d7 10\u22126 ETH/ms. This\nsupports our initial observation from a single slot, reaffirming that by prolonging their wait\ntime, validators can enhance their MEV payments.\n4.1.2\nThe Significance of Waiting\nAlthough we noted a positive marginal value of delay, if the rewards gained from waiting are\ninsignificant compared to the consensus protocol rewards issued for block proposals, then it\nmight not be worth risking the consensus in the first place. To scrutinise the relationship\nbetween the rewards from waiting (i.e., MEV rewards) and the proposal rewards from\nconsensus, we examined 5,726 proposed blocks from the relays we have monitored. These\nblocks belonged to three different epoch ranges between June 1, 2023, and June 11, 2023.\nWhile we used the MEV reward data provided by the relays, we fetched the consensus\nrewards validators received for their proposals from the beaconcha.in API.\nIn Figure 3, we analyse three distinct epoch ranges, each containin around 80 epochs on\naverage. The diagram distinguishes between two forms of rewards \u2013 the blue and orange\nsegments. The blue section represents the median MEV reward that validators, who proposed\na block during that epoch via one of our observed relays, received. In contrast, the orange\nsegment represents the median proposal reward issued by the consensus protocol to validators.\nThe proposal reward comprises attestation and sync aggregate inclusion rewards [19].\n205130 205140 205150 205160 205170 205180 205190 205200\nEpoch\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\nMedian Proposer Reward (ETH)\nMEV Reward (66.16%)\nProposal Reward (33.84%)\n205770\n205780\n205790\n205800\n205810\n205820\n205830\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n52.76%\n47.24%\n207270 207280 207290 207300 207310 207320 207330 207340\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\n54.98%\n45.02%\nFigure 3 Median distribution of MEV and proposal rewards from consensus per epoch, visualized\nacross various epoch ranges.\nA prominent observation across all three epoch ranges is the dominance of MEV rewards\nover proposal rewards. The first epoch range analysed showcased the largest disparity,\namounting to a notable 30%. Specifically, the median MEV rewards came out to be 0.067\nETH, 0.038 ETH, and 0.042 ETH respectively, culminating in an overall median of 0.048\nETH. Meanwhile, the proposal rewards consistently stayed at 0.034 ETH. This led to a\nmedian difference of 0.013 ETH per proposed block. Furthermore, MEV rewards accounted\nfor 58.32% of all the rewards across the analysed slots.\nTo determine the median MEV reward since the launch of MEV-Boost (which coincided\nwith the merge), we utilized data from mevboost.pics, revealing 0.053 ETH as the median\nvalue.

Comparing this\ntime with the arrival time of the highest value bid could yield more precise figures regarding\nthe total unrealised value and the time difference between winning bids and highest value\nbids. As this data is not publicly accessible, we resorted to using bid arrival times, which\nstill provide valuable insight.\n4.1.4\nPlaying the Game Rationally\nOur research thus far has uncovered considerable incentives for rational validators within\nthe Ethereum network to participate in waiting games. However, the manner in which these\nstrategies are employed differs from relay to relay. In the default relay implementation [12],\neach builder bid undergoes a simulation to confirm its validity before it is made accessible\nto the proposer. This process introduces an average latency of 140ms [18], shortening the\nduration of the block auction and reducing the number of competing bids. To counter this\nlatency, the optimistic relay design has been proposed [29], and adopted by the Ultra Sound\nRelay. Under the optimistic approach, it is presumed that builders are submitting valid\nblocks, which are instantaneously made available while the validation is delayed. However,\nthis strategy necessitates that builders deposit funds upfront, securing payment for the\nvalidator if the builder fails to deliver the promised block or payment.\nIn examining 12,500 slots, we verified the positive influence of optimistic relaying on\nlatency reduction. Out of these slots, 9,250 were relayed using at least one of the three\nrelays we studied8. Table 1 displays the distribution of block deliveries across the relays.\nNotably, Ultra Sound Relay, known for its adoption of optimistic relaying, garnered the most\nbids per slot and delivered the highest quantity of blocks with the largest median value.\nAdditionally, Ultra Sound reported the latest median winning bid arrival time. A more\ndetailed distribution of winning bid timings can be found in Appendix B.\nTable 1 Summary of Relay Performance Metrics for the Slot Range 6 087 501-6 100 000.\nRelay\nBlocks\nAvg.

The ultimate consequence is an increasing trend of block auctions being\nclinched by higher-value, late-submitted bids, thereby augmenting the rewards for validators.\nWhile no direct evidence of validators partaking in waiting games has been identified [33],\nour analysis of 12,500 slots, along with the extensive historical data provided in [40], confirms\nthat validators strategically act to maximise their profits from MEV-Boost by registering\nwith relays which deliver the most value. Currently, Ultra Sound Relay leads the pack,\n8 A builder may have submitted the same winning bid to multiple relays. In such instances, we categorise\nall relays featuring that bid as relayers of the winning block.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "5fa55e9b-23ff-4074-8872-e908ff2290df": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fa55e9b-23ff-4074-8872-e908ff2290df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "14", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "14\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\ndelivering around 30% of all blocks relayed through MEV-Boost, and offering the highest\nmedian value of 0.06 ETH to the validators [40].\n4.2\nThe Risks of Waiting\nHaving established that waiting games present potential profit opportunities for validators,\nour focus now turns to evaluate the associated risks, particularly in terms of consensus\ndisruption. Although a validator enjoys a monopoly during their slot duration, the ultimate\nconfirmation of the block can hinge on the attestations it gathers from the attestors in\nthe respective slot committees. If a block is proposed too late for attestors to vote on it,\nthese attestors might opt to vote on its parent block instead. Under such circumstances,\na block securing less than 40% of attestations is exposed to the risk of being forked out\nby the following slot\u2019s proposer, using proposer-boost as outlined in Ethereum consensus\nspecifications [2]. In this section, we delve into the analysis of attestation shares for the\nproposed blocks and identify those susceptible to forking. We contrast orphaned blocks with\ntheir non-orphaned counterparts to comprehend the potential impact of timing. Moreover,\nwe employ an agent-based model to simulate Ethereum consensus, which allows us to observe\nconsensus stability when a specific portion of validators engage in waiting games, with varying\ndegrees of delay times.\n4.2.1\nAttestation Shares\nExpanding on the analysis in [33] about the share of attestations included in the subsequent\nslot of a proposed block, we examine the next slot attestation shares for the blocks within\nour data set. We focus on the relationship between the winning bid arrival time to the relay,\nthe attained attestation share, and the vulnerability to being forked out by the next slot\nproposer through the proposer-boost mechanism [2].\nRecalling that the fork choice protocol, LMD-Ghost, computes a block\u2019s weight as the\ncumulative effective balances of validators who attested to the block in a prior slot as an\nattestation for a block at slot n is only included starting from slot n + 1, plus the weight\ncoming from the parent block, we assess the impact of the proposer-boost mechanism. This\nmechanism instantaneously assigns a 40% committee weight to a timely block proposed\nwithin the first 4 seconds of a slot, derived from the total effective balance of validators\nassigned for that slot, thereby enabling a potential re-organisation (re-org) of a lower-weight\npast block. To analyse the relationship between this re-org vulnerability and the winning\nbuilder block\u2019s arrival timing, we measure each block\u2019s share of attestations included in the\nsucceeding slot. This involves calculating the block\u2019s weight (presuming a uniform effective\nbalance of 32 ETH for each validator) and normalising against the slot\u2019s committee weight,\nwhich yields the share of attestations a block has accrued from the total potential attestations.\nAny block with an attestation share below 40% in the subsequent slot is deemed susceptible\nto a re-org through the proposer-boost.\nOur results highlight that, on average, blocks gather 98% of attestation shares in the\nfollowing slot. Out of the 8,121 distinct blocks proposed by the relays under our analysis,\nonly 27 blocks acquired under 40% shares, with a median arrival time for winning bids\nof 1223ms. Remarkably, we observed 75 blocks that arrived later than the 1223ms mark\nyet accrued sufficient shares to be unaffected by the proposer-boost, with an average share\nof 90%. This analysis is visually represented in Figure 5, where each blue dot stands for\na block, and those within the red region identify blocks vulnerable to a re-org using the\nproposer-boost, based on their attestation share in the subsequent slot.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "5f0dba83-ddcf-49fa-b9d1-d626301ad49b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f0dba83-ddcf-49fa-b9d1-d626301ad49b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "15", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B.

Each blue dot denotes a unique block, with those in the\nred region indicating blocks vulnerable to getting forked out by the next slot\u2019s block proposer due\nto receiving less than 40% attestation share.\nWe further examined the relationship between the arrival times of winning bids in\nconsecutive slots and the accrued attestation shares. As depicted in Figure 6, each dot\ncorresponds to a block, with its x and y-coordinates representing the arrival times of its own\nand its following slot\u2019s winning bids, respectively. Blocks are colour-coded based on their\nattestation shares in the following slot. Our results revealed a tendency for attestation shares\nto decrease when a block\u2019s winning bid is delayed while the succeeding slot\u2019s winning bid\narrives in a timely manner. Specifically, we identified 23 blocks vulnerable to the proposer-\nboost with attestation shares under 40% and a following slot\u2019s winning bid arriving within\nthe initial 4s. Nevertheless, these blocks remained in the canonical chain, implying that the\npotential proposer-boost re-org was not exploited.\n4.2.2\nOrphaned Blocks\nIn our final empirical data analysis, we delved into the occurrence of orphaned blocks within\nour slot range and its correlation with the timing of the winning bid arrivals. We discovered\n151 slots, amounting to roughly 1.2% of all slots we have analyzed, where a block failed to\nbe included in the canonical chain. Among these, 123 slots had missed proposals, while 28\nslots featured orphaned blocks, half of which stemmed from MEV-Boost and the other half\nwere locally built by validators. Figure 11 in Appendix C illustrates the distribution of these\norphaned blocks across relays.\nWhen we compared the timings of winning bids for both orphaned and non-orphaned\nblocks, Figure 7 reveal that the winning bid for the earliest orphaned block was submitted\n271ms prior to the slot start.

In this section, we present an\nagent-based model to study a scenario where a consistent share of the validators follows the\nsame delay strategy: whenever a delaying validator is selected as a block proposer, they wait\nuntil a certain time (which is the same across delayers) into the slot to release the block.\nThey do this to maximise their MEV: from what we observed in the previous sections, there\nis a good reason to think that MEV rewards correlate positively with the interval between\nthe block release and the previous block release. For this simulation, we are not interested in\nestimating the actual amount of increased profit these delayer validators would accrue, as we\nhave already shown that it would be positive. Here we want to observe the eventual fall-out\nof such a family of strategies on the overall consensus strategy: we want to observe if such\nstrategies may decrease the number of blocks included in the mainchain, which we assume to\nbe an indicator of the consensus efficiency of a blockchain.\nThe framework we refer to is essentially the same presented in [26]: the agents are\nvalidators, connected on a peer-to-peer network generated following the Erdos-Renyi random\nmodel [21]. Time is assumed to be continuous and divided into slots; validators are randomly\nselected to be block proposers for each slot, and because they are assumed to be fully honest,\nthey release the block exactly at the beginning of the assigned slot. The remaining validators\nare selected as attestors: they release an attestation to certify on the blockchain that they\nreceived the block from the block proposer and that it is valid. If they do not receive the block\nbefore the 4 seconds threshold, they are allowed to attest for the previous head of the chain.\nThe only two random events that may happen are block gossiping and attestation gossiping,\nwhich follow exponential waiting times of parameters \u03c4block and \u03c4attestation.\nGossiping\nevents happen when an agent is randomly picked to communicate the information about\nthe blocks/attestations they received to one of their neighbour agents, picked at random as\nwell. In [26], the authors showed how a phase transition in consensus efficiency is observed\nbecause of \u03c4block: when the value becomes larger than a certain threshold depending on the\ntopological properties of the peer-to-peer network, the number of blocks included in the\nmainchain declines abruptly. In the present work, we increase the number of parameters to\ntake into account the delay strategy as part of the waiting games. We introduce xd \u2208 [0, 1]\nthe share of agents who are actively following the delay strategy, and td \u2208 [0, 12] which is the\nactual delay the delayers wait from the start of the slot before releasing the block.\nWe proceed by generating a sample of simulations where we vary xd and td, while we\nkeep fixed \u03c4block = \u03c4attestation = 3 and the peer-to-peer topology, as well as the simulation\ntime.\nAs measures we care to observe, we consider the mainchain Rate \u00b5, from [26], to estimate\nthe consensus efficiency, formally defined as:\n\u00b5 = |M|\n|B|\n(3)\nwhere |M| is the number of blocks included in the canonical mainchain(M) while |B| is the\ntotal number of blocks produced during the simulation.\nThe second measure we consider is the orphan rate of the blocks produced by the delayers\n\u0398d, which we use to proxy, on the one hand, the rewards missed by the delayers and, on the\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "d1cc6355-083d-4c23-9377-767a7c1794f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1cc6355-083d-4c23-9377-767a7c1794f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "18", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "18\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\nother hand, the direct damage to a consensus as a consequence of the delaying strategy.\n\u0398d = |{b /\u2208 M\ns.t.\nproposer(b) \u2208 D}|\n(4)\nwhere D is the set of agents who follow the delayer strategy and proposer(b) represents the\nagent who proposed block b.\nSimulations results are plotted in Figure 8 and the results are intuitive: the effect of the\ntime delay exercised by the delayers does not significantly affect consensus until it becomes\nlarger than the slot time minus the latency time: 12 \u2212 3 = 9 (the latency also represents\nthe average time between two consecutive gossip interactions between the same two nodes).\nWe also observe that the effect of the share of delayer stops increasing around xd = 0.5, at\nwhich the number of consecutive mixed blocks (delayer blocks followed by honest blocks) is\nmaximum.

We found\nsubstantial incentives for validators to deviate from the honest validator specifications,\nprimarily due to the emerging incentive, the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).\nThe Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) implementation by Flashbots, MEV-Boost, have\npermitted validators to outsource block building to a competitive market of builders. This\nchange has had a significant impact on the dynamics of block proposal strategies. Our results\nconfirm that MEV rewards, which increase over time as more transactions arrive, dominate\nconsensus proposal rewards, which provides sufficient incentive for validators to delay their\nblock proposals - essentially playing the waiting game.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "ed53ab76-7c4b-414a-a93b-cdae4a3d7f76": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed53ab76-7c4b-414a-a93b-cdae4a3d7f76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "19", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B.

Our data\ndemonstrates that while late blocks tend to accrue fewer attestation shares, not all late\nblocks are at risk of orphaning. In fact, orphaning is a relatively rare event, occurring in\nonly 0.22% of cases in our study.\nWe further analyzed the impact of waiting games on consensus stability using an agent-\nbased simulation model, simulating a range of delaying behaviours by validators in various\nscenarios. Our findings indicate that a delay strategy, if adopted by enough validators, can\nbe profitable without leading to consensus degradation.\nIn conclusion, our empirical data analysis and simulation results indicate that the risks\nassociated with delaying proposals are outweighed by the potential benefits, given the\ncurrent dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism and MEV. Looking forward, we aim to\nfurther examine the interactions among builders, relays, and validators, particularly in terms\nof the latencies introduced during these interactions. We hope this will enable a better\nunderstanding of how waiting games can be optimized for validators, while ensuring a more\ncompetitive block auction for builders.\nReferences\n1\nCoW protocol.

Welcome back to the built on\nBitcoin podcast where we cover everything going on in\nthe stacks ecosystem. I'm a broken record, but that's\nwhat we do here. And this is a this week in Stacks\nepisode. So we're covering everything that happened\nin the past week or so. I'm your host, Jake\nblockchain. And yeah, let's just jump right into it.\nActually was a pretty busy week.\n00:00:27.414 - 00:01:04.826, Speaker A: Last week was\nkind of slow and I kind of chalked it up to like\nwe're in a build mode. Everyone just heads down doing\ntheir thing. But there's a ton to talk about today\nbecause everyone's been building and now things are\ntrickling out. So first on the list is hyperchains. I\nannounced last week on the episode that hyperchains\nhad hit Testnet, and that was from a tweet that munib\nand Trevor posted. But there was also a corresponding\nblog post and it goes into some of what you can\nexpect from hyperchains. First of all, it is live on\nTestnet.\n00:01:04.826 - 00:01:53.546, Speaker A: It's building\nblocks, it's doing the things. And they now have it\nslated for the first test case using some kind of\nNFT. I don't know if that's going to be plugged into\none of the current marketplaces and some kind of\nspecial collab or they're going to do something very\ndistinct to try it out. But next month, in July,\nthey're going to try the first use cases where you\ncan actually go on. And they also made it known in\nthis blog post how you're going to use hyperchains,\nmeaning how you're going to get assets to and from\nit. And what it will look like is you will send\nassets in a transaction over to the hyperchain. And\nthen when you want to interact with those assets,\nyou're going to change your network.\n00:01:53.546 - 00:02:44.238, Speaker A: So if you've\nused testnet before, you go into your hero wallet and\non that top right button, you hit it and it will say\nswitch account, create account. And usually you'll\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "67bad966-e475-4a5b-b5f8-6327b9e39a97": {"__data__": {"id_": "67bad966-e475-4a5b-b5f8-6327b9e39a97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "2", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E63: Weekly - Hyperchains, Web3Week, Ryan Shea , NFT Marketplace updates, NoCodeClarity, NeoSwap", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0ZtGxAPII", "release_date": "2022-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "use that to switch accounts so you can hide your NFTs\non some sub account so that your main BTC looks\nbeautiful and sexy. But that third or fourth option\ndown, it says change network and it's usually on main\nnet by default. And if you were say, using the Alex\ntestnet back when they were stress testing the\ncontracts, that's how you would get access to Alex\nback then you would click change network and go from\nMainnet to Testnet. That's how you're going to use\nhyperchains. So a new option will be there called\nhyperchains, and you'll switch that network. And then\nwhen you log into a site that has hyperchain\nfunctionality, that's how you'll interface with the\nnetwork.\n00:02:44.238 - 00:03:16.310, Speaker A: So that was\nnew. Super interesting. Also, they released a roadmap\nand I'll drop it into the description below if you\nwant to review it. But there were some notable things\non there. One was next month is the first test case,\nbut also for the rest of the year they're aiming for\nQ one next year of an official launch, and I think\nthis is the first I've seen it. But stacks 2.1 is\nslated for December, so that brings the potential.\n00:03:16.310 - 00:03:56.930, Speaker A: The biggest\nthings it's going to bring, as far as I know, is\nupgrades to clarity, so devs will have more\nfunctionality to play with. And what that means\nthrough some of those new tools is that we'll most\nlikely get stacks mining pools finally. So there's\nsome increased functions coming. I've heard this from\nseeing different blog posts, talking to Zan in past\ninterviews, that there's some of the things you need\nin clarity 2.1 that make it so much easier to run a\ndecentralized mining pool. So that's exciting. I\nthink it also increases some of the connections to\nbitcoin.\n00:03:56.930 - 00:04:21.594, Speaker A: So December,\nstacks 2.1 is slated to come out. That's huge. Next\non the list. I had a fantastic interview with John\nEnos, who is the founder of Neoswap.

Basically, they're\ntrying to unlock liquidity across all kinds of\nmarkets.\n00:04:21.594 - 00:05:11.950, Speaker A: It's really\ninsane. And they're starting with digital assets,\nnamely nfts. And they're doing these things called\nNeoswap parties, where you log into a party, you set\nyour budget, you choose some nfts you want to put up\nfor trade, and then the party starts. You can pick\nfrom NFTs people have put up it, uses some special AI\nalgorithm and then finds the perfect multi way trade\ndepending on everyone who's in the room. So it could\nbe like, you get one, I give three, they give me\nmoney, and you can just make this perfect trade.\nAnyway, John is currently in the stacks accelerator.\nHe has a mathematics background and yeah, I mean,\nit's one of those things where if you haven't tried\nNeoswap yet, no matter how much I sell you on it,\nit's not going to hit till you try it.\n00:05:11.950 - 00:05:44.106, Speaker A: So I'll say,\nlisten to that interview just to get you kind of\nexcited about what to expect. But if you haven't\njoined a neo swap party. But yeah, I dropped that\nlast Friday. Thank you to John for coming on. Next\nup, project Indigo. This is the AI, not AI, the NFT\ncollection that's also an interactive game. And they\nreleased the first two chapters a few months ago and\nthey've just been kind of heads down since then.\n00:05:44.106 - 00:06:20.680, Speaker A: And the way\nthey were building, I guess, wasn't working. It was\nhard to always kind of like ship the next chapter\njust in time. So they've been working a ton on more\ncontinuous story mode features and they're starting\nto come to life. So they dropped a trailer which you\ncan hit the link below to watch. But you can also go\nto projectindigonft.com. And now you'll see an\ninteractive map on the homepage and you can click it\nand you're starting to see more things pop up.

There's like collection Trader\nview, order book and something else. You can click\nTrader view and it will give you a whole suite of\nfeatures that you could sort by. And one of the\ncooler ones is you can see a live view of how much\nnfts have been trading for in that collection over a\nset period of time. So you can see a window of like\nin the past seven days. How many of these NFTs have\nsold? Like are they moving? And then what's their\nprice range? And you can see it just super easy.\n00:07:15.750 - 00:07:44.420, Speaker A: You can\nhighlight it, see the NFT, click on it, get more\ndetails, watch its price action. So if you're an NFT\ntrader and you're doing this, you want to get data\nreal quick. This is a fantastic, fantastic feature.\nSo that was cool to see. And then on Gamma, Gamma's\ndropped a bunch of new features as well. One is you\ncan now make offers on nfTs, which is cool. So now\nyou don't just have to wait for someone to list it.\n00:07:44.420 - 00:08:15.930, Speaker A: You can go to\nany collection and any NFT and submit an offer. And\nthis is great. I've been trying to snag a couple\nwhere I literally will go find that person's BTC\nbecause you can just look and highlight it and I'll\nsend them a small amount of stacks like one stack or\ntwo stack. And in the memo page I'll be like, hey,\ncan I buy your NFT? And I have a 0% hit rate. It's\nalso expensive. I'm wasting stacks clogging the\nnetwork. Now I don't have to do that.\n00:08:15.930 - 00:09:05.286, Speaker A: So Gamma has\nthat built in. You can submit an offer, and within\nthat offer you can leave a message so you can kind of\nsell yourself on like, hey, I'm a really good guy,\nI'll take good care of this NFT and then submit that\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "f0a9dae7-ca70-47b2-aa7a-5649f6ed7b07": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0a9dae7-ca70-47b2-aa7a-5649f6ed7b07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "5", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E63: Weekly - Hyperchains, Web3Week, Ryan Shea , NFT Marketplace updates, NoCodeClarity, NeoSwap", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0ZtGxAPII", "release_date": "2022-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "bid. So that's new. And then you can also now sort\nnot just by the usual high low rarity, but you can\nfilter by different categories or different. You can\nadd filters while you're sorting, so you can add a\nsort by high to low and under 1000 facts. Before, you\ncouldn't do that, so that's cool. And then they also\ndropped some new features around clarity on minting.\n00:09:05.286 - 00:09:49.450, Speaker A: So if you go\nto a collection page and it's still currently\nminting, you couldn't tell before you had to go to a\nseparate part of the site, which is like the crate\nportal. And it would say minting now these\ncollections. But on the main site it would just show\nas there's 70 pieces or 100 pieces that are live and\nyou could review them now on the main site, you can\nsee if it's minting currently and click directly into\nthat part of the site and partake if you hold a\nwhitelist or if it's public mint. So props to gamma,\nprops to byzantian. Love to see the healthy\ncompetition of the marketplaces. Yeah, super dope. So\nnext up on the list, we'll keep it going.\n00:09:49.450 - 00:10:08.720, Speaker A: Like I said,\nthere's some nuggets this week. We got a lot. Ryan\nShea, which is the co founder of Stacks, I've always\nheard that name. Didn't really see him much. It seems\nlike he just kind of like went and did his own thing\nfor a while. He's back now. The boy's back.\n00:10:08.720 - 00:10:45.210, Speaker A: He's also\njoined Stacks ventures as a board member, so he'll be\nadvising and helping teams. Obviously, I work there.\nI haven't heard much more besides the tweets that go\nout. I have not met the man yet, but cool to see the\nco founder of Stacks coming back into the mix. And\nhe's also been hitting the ground running as far as\nimprovement proposals. So there's been two that he's\nkind of like, started on the stacks forum. One is\nabout the stacking mechanism and one is about minor\ndecentralization.\n00:10:45.210 - 00:11:46.974, Speaker A: And I mean,\nthe miner issue has been one for a while, where we've\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "50b4a005-d6ce-40e4-920b-c08c613a8dca": {"__data__": {"id_": "50b4a005-d6ce-40e4-920b-c08c613a8dca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "6", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E63: Weekly - Hyperchains, Web3Week, Ryan Shea , NFT Marketplace updates, NoCodeClarity, NeoSwap", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0ZtGxAPII", "release_date": "2022-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "seen between five and nine miners pretty much the\nentire time I've been in stacks for the past year,\nand it's hard to say that you're a decentralized\nchain when there's less than ten people that run this\nentire network.

Web three week just concluded. The\npast three days, there's been conferences going on\npretty much most of the day. The first one was it's\nNFT, which is about what it sounds like nfTs, but\nspecifically in investing and trading them. The\nsecond day was the Gamefi and Metaverse conference,\nwhich was headlined by Neil Stevenson giving an\namazing interview. He's the author of Snow Crash,\ninvented the word Metaverse.\n00:12:22.118 - 00:12:49.666, Speaker A: But yeah, so\nthat was cool. And then today, unmutable went on,\nwhich was the web3 music conference. And yeah, I\nwon't deep dive into any specifics. One, because I\nwas busy doing sax venture stuff, so I didn't get to\nparticipate too much. But there was just a ton that\nwent on.

Within\nthis PoS framework, validators acquire a distinct monopoly position during their assigned slots,\ngiven that block proposal rights are set deterministically, contrasting with Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nprotocols. Consequently, validators have the power to delay block proposals, stepping outside the\nhonest validator specs, optimizing potential returns through MEV payments. Nonetheless, this\nstrategic behaviour introduces the risk of orphaning if attestors fail to observe and vote on the block\ntimely. Our quantitative analysis of this waiting phenomenon and its associated risks reveals an\nopportunity for enhanced MEV extraction, exceeding standard protocol rewards, and providing\nsufficient incentives for validators to play the game. Notably, our findings indicate that delayed\nproposals do not always result in orphaning and orphaned blocks are not consistently proposed\nlater than non-orphaned ones.\nTo further examine consensus stability under varying network\nconditions, we adopt an agent-based simulation model tailored for PoS-Ethereum, illustrating that\nconsensus disruption will not be observed unless significant delay strategies are adopted. Ultimately,\nthis research offers valuable insights into the advent of waiting games on Ethereum, providing a\ncomprehensive understanding of trade-offs and potential profits for validators within the blockchain\necosystem.\n2012 ACM Subject Classification Security and privacy \u2192 Economics of security and privacy;\nInformation systems \u2192 Distributed storage\nKeywords and phrases Ethereum, Consensus, Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Maximal Extractable Value\n(MEV), Incentives\n1\nIntroduction\nThe blockchain landscape has seen tremendous growth and evolution over the years, with\ninnovative concepts continually emerging to enhance its functionality and efficiency. Ethereum,\na key player in this arena, has recently undergone major upgrades, with the merge1 being the\nmost prevalent, replacing the Proof-of-Work (PoW)-based block proposer selection mechanism\n1 https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/\narXiv:2307.05814v1  [cs.CR]  11 Jul 2023\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "737badb7-6827-4ce1-a910-afe4f6b16087": {"__data__": {"id_": "737badb7-6827-4ce1-a910-afe4f6b16087", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "2", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "2\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\nwith a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based one [35, 36]. With this upgrade, Etheruem also introduced\na new consensus protocol Gasper comprising Latest Message Driven Greediest Heaviest\nObserved SubTree (LMD GHOST) for fork-choice and Casper Friendly Finality Gadget\n(FFG) for finality, replacing the longest-chain consensus. Switching to PoS remarkably\nreduced the electricity consumption of the Ethereum blockchain (down by 99.98% according\nto the 2022 report of Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute2) which led to a significant cut down\nin block proposal rewards as consensus participants, known as validators, do not require as\nhigh incentives as PoW-Ethereum miners did. Hence, the validators depend even more on\ntransaction fees and exogenous rewards like Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), then miners\ndid.\nIncentives play an essential role in the evolution of public, permissionless blockchains such\nas Ethereum. Misaligned incentives, however, can lead to a lack of interest in contributing to\na network or, potentially, to profit-seeking attacks, dangering consensus stability [17]. MEV\nhas emerged as a powerful incentive within Ethereum [20], enabling network participants to\ngain profits beyond protocol rewards through strategic transaction issuance and ordering [46].\nIn particular, participants who partake in MEV extraction employ transaction ordering\ntechniques inspired by traditional finance to execute profitable strategies based on the\nnetwork state concerning pending transactions in the mempool and the most recently finalized\nblockchain state [30]. The prominence of MEV has risen with the advent of Decentralised\nFinance (DeFi) ecosystem, as shown by the emergence of sophisticated bots exploiting MEV\nopportunities, regardless of their potential disruption to users [20].\nCurrently, the PoS-Ethereum protocol allows validators to release their block in a 12\nseconds slot time, during which the designated validator has a total monopoly on the block\nrelease. This feature introduces new opportunities for MEV extraction through strategic\nwaiting games. To illustrate, we hypothesize that the block proposer may exploit their\nmonopolistic position and wait as long as possible within the slot limits to release the block\nin order to extract additional MEV. However, if a large proportion of validators on the\nEthereum network engage in these delayed releases, it could result in instability within the\nconsensus of the network, as delays in block release may lead to multiple forked blocks.\nThus, this paper delves into the impact of delayed block releases, or more broadly, waiting\ngames, on the Ethereum consensus framework. We primarily focus on answering three pivotal\nresearch questions:\n1. Are waiting games profitable for validators, considering the dynamics of value evolution\nduring a slot time and the relative importance of MEV rewards compared to proposal\nrewards from the consensus layer?\n2. Can validators engage in waiting games without risking their blocks being vulnerable to\ngetting orphaned?\n3. Could waiting games potentially disrupt the stability of Ethereum consensus and, if so,\nunder which conditions?\n1.1\nRelated Work\nAs far as we are aware, [33] is the sole study exclusively focusing on waiting or timing games\nin PoS-Ethereum, although [39] also notes a positive correlation between bid arrival time and\nvalue, while exploring the intricate details about the block construction market available on\nEthereum, MEV-Boost [3].

Despite noting that\ntiming games are worthwhile, they find these strategies not currently being exploited by\nconsensus participants. However, drawing attention to the differences between our study\nand that of the authors in [33] is critical. While we also analyze the value of time, we\nfurther investigate the importance of MEV rewards relative to consensus layer proposal\nrewards and examine unrealised values due to validators\u2019 acting prematurely, not capturing\nthe maximum payments by the builders. Additionally, we assess attestations concerning\nforking vulnerability and explore the connection between orphaned blocks and the timing\nof their winning bids, determining if orphaned blocks arrive later than others or if there\nare non-orphaned blocks with later submitted winning bids. This comprehensive inspection\nprovides deeper insights into the value and significance of waiting games and the associated\nrisks.\nTo test the waiting games under different network conditions, we adopt an Agent-Based\nModel (ABM) specifically devised for PoS-Ethereum by [26]. In particular, studying the\nimpact of waiting games on the Ethereum consensus requires a robust model to examine how\ndifferent waiting strategies influence the consensus properties. Moreover, latency plays an\nessential role in defining consensus. Therefore, the ABM model from [26] is ideal as the model\nexplicitly includes variables for the topology of the peer-to-peer network, and of particular\ninterest, the average block and attestation latencies. Furthermore, the ABM provides specific\ntechniques for accurately measuring the consensus of the simulated PoS-Ethereum network.\n1.2\nContribution\nThis work delivers the following contributions:\n1. Illuminates the potential profitability and inherent risks of waiting games in PoS-Ethereum,\noffering new insights into block proposal strategies and validator trade-offs.\n2. Underlines the economic impact of MEV rewards, revealing their influence on rational\nproposer behaviour and showcasing unrealised value within premature bid selection.\n3. Delivers a comprehensive analysis of attestation shares, identifying blocks at higher\nforking risk, and contrasts orphaned and non-orphaned blocks, highlighting the impact of\nproposal timing on confirmation.\n4. Employs an agent-based model to simulate various validator behaviour scenarios in\nEthereum consensus, enhancing our understanding of its resilience and stability against\ntiming games.\n1.3\nOrganization\nBeyond this introduction, the paper is organized into four additional sections.

Next, we delve into the concept of Maximal\nExtractable Value (MEV), an additional profit that network participants can capture through\ncertain strategies employed during block production, which forms a crucial aspect of our\nresearch. Lastly, we present the Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS)-the separation of the\nroles in block production to proposers (validators) and builders (who construct blocks)-to\nmitigate the risks associated with MEV centralization around the consensus layer.\n2.1\nPoS-Ethereum Consensus\nThe Ethereum network is a peer-to-peer network that operates in a decentralised manner and\ncomprises nodes (computers or servers) that maintain a copy of the blockchain. Moreover,\nthe nodes can offer varying functionalities, such as full nodes or light nodes. However, certain\nnodes perform a specific role as validators, incentivised by reward mechanisms. Proof-of-Stake\n(PoS) is a blockchain mechanism used to select the next block proposer in a Sybil attack-\nresistant manner. In PoS, network members who wish to participate in block production\nmust stake money to the protocol, and unlike PoW, there is no need for participants to\nsolve a complex puzzle or use mining hardware. Instead, participants have a financial stake\nthat can be slashed in case of misbehaviour. This makes PoS chains more energy-efficient\ncompared to PoW chains.\nIn the PoS-Ethereum consensus, validators are participants involved in the consensus\nprocess. Validators need to deposit a stake as collateral (32 Ether) to the deposit contract,\nwhich contains a Merkle root for all deposits.\nIn addition, validators are required to\nmaintain a node that facilitates communication and message exchange within the gossip\nnetwork. Validators are incentivised by the rewards they receive for honest conduct, thereby\ncompensating them for their associated costs. The protocol randomly selects a validator\nto propose a block. If a validator misbehaves (e.g. proposes multiple blocks in one slot),\nthe respective validator gets penalised (i.e. stake slashed). Additionally, a committee of\nvalidators is chosen at every slot to vote on the validity of the proposed block. At least\ntwo third of the committee must agree for the block to be considered valid. Validators who\nsubmit contradicting votes are penalised. The PoS-Ethereum protocol divides time into\nepochs and slots, with each epoch containing 32 slots and each slot lasting 12 seconds. In\nPoS-Ethereum, a block is considered finalised after two epochs.\nValidators in Ethereum use the LMD GHOST [34] fork choice rule to establish the\ncanonical chain and accurately propose or attest to blocks. Under this framework, validators\nmaintain a record of the latest message received from all other validators and only update it\nif the new vote comes from a slot strictly later than the existing entry. Therefore, in the\nevent that a validator receives two equivocating votes from the same validator for the same\nslot, only the vote that arrives first is taken into consideration. The consensus mechanism\noperates in two phases. In the first phase, LMD GHOST operates on a smaller time scale,\nwith time segments referred to as slots. In the second phase, Casper FFG [16] operates\non a larger time scale, within epochs composed of 32 slots.

Validators earn rewards by casting votes that align with the\nmajority of the other validators (i.e. honest interaction), specifically when proposing blocks\nand participating in syncing committees [2]. Moreover, validators receive rewards for attesting\nand proposing blocks on time (e.g. attestation rewards). As a result, the network reaches a\nconsensus and validates the data in the blockchain (i.e. finalisation). Block proposers receive\nan aggregated reward of the Gas Tips (i.e. the fees users pay to prioritise their transactions)\nincluded in a block. On the other hand, the value of the attestation rewards for each epoch\nis calculated based on a Base_Reward, which functions as the fundamental unit for the\nother rewards. The Base_Reward is determined by the validator\u2019s effective balance and\nthe total number of active validators and represents the average reward that a validator can\nreceive per epoch when operating under optimal conditions. Specifically, the calculation\nentails dividing the product of the validator\u2019s effective balance and a Base_Reward_Factor\nby the square root of the total active balance, as shown in Equation 1:\nBase_Reward = Effective_Balance \u00d7 Base_Reward_Factor\n\u221aActive_Balance\n(1)\nWhere the Effective_Balance is the effective balance of the attesting validator and\nthe Active_Balance is the total active balance staked across all active validators, and the\nBase_Reward_Factor is a constant of value 64. Therefore, the Base_Reward is propor-\ntional to the effective balance of the validator and inversely proportional to the number of\nvalidators present. Accordingly, as the number of validators in the network increases, the\nrewards are distributed among more validators, which decreases the rewards per validator.\nMoreover, validators are rewarded based on the correctness of their behaviour. Specifically,\nthe attestation reward is influenced by the Flag_Reward [19], shown in:\nFlag_Reward =\nFlag_Weight\nWeight_Denom \u00d7 Base_Reward \u00d7 Attestation_Balance\nActive_Balance\n(2)\nWhere Flag_Weight and Weight_Denom are constants that vary between flags, and\nthe Attestation_Balance is the sum of the effective balances of all attesting validators.\nAccordingly, the Attestation_Reward is the sum of the flag rewards (P Flag_Reward).\nIn addition, sync rewards and block proposal rewards form part of the reward structure.\nThe former is a reward for validators that participate in the sync committee to sign new\nblock headers in every slot. The latter are the rewards linked to proposing a beacon block.\nSpecifically, the reward consists of including the attestation aggregations from validator votes\nnot yet present in the beacon chain and including sync aggregates. Moreover, the block\nproposer is responsible for including the aggregate from the sync committee participants [19].\n2.3\nMaximal Extractable Value\nThe concept of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has grown significantly within the\nEthereum blockchain, particularly with the surge of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) domain\nsince 2020 [46]. Daian et al. [20] initially coined the term Miner Extractable Value, implying\nthe additional value that miners, or privileged actors, could seize by manipulating transaction\nsets and order in a block, beyond standard protocol incentives such as block rewards and\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "84825469-4e43-49cd-b9fc-73a4eabb1976": {"__data__": {"id_": "84825469-4e43-49cd-b9fc-73a4eabb1976", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "6", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "6\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\ntransaction fees [20]. Despite these privileged actors having a position of power, this value is\nalso available to any network participant who can observe the confirmed blockchain state\nand monitor pending transactions. Consequently, the Miner or Privileged Extractable Value\nforms a subset of Maximal Extractable Value, which includes any value that can be extracted\nwithin a blockchain network [30].\nTo exploit MEV, network participants who do not possess authority over block content\nmust influence the transaction order by offering payments to block proposers. These payments\ncan be transaction fees or direct payments facilitated by MEV markets such as Flashbots\nAuction [10]. Participants seeking MEV, known as MEV searchers, employ transaction\nordering techniques inspired by traditional finance, such as frontrunning and backrunning\n[22, 38, 45], and DeFi instruments like flash loans [31], to execute profitable strategies based\non the network state concerning pending transactions in the mempool [45] and the most\nrecently confirmed blockchain state [44].\nExisting research [30, 41] and web services such as MEV Explore [7] or EigenPhi [6]\nthat quantify the extracted MEV on Ethereum are limited by their heuristic approaches to\ndetecting certain MEV patterns (e.g., arbitrages, sandwiches, liquidations) and the protocols\nthey inspect. Consequently, they only provide a lower-bound estimate of the actual value\nextracted. According to MEX Explore [7], more than $675 million worth of MEV had been\nharnessed until the merge in September 2022. Furthermore, data from EigenPhi shows\nongoing MEV extraction, with approximately $9.5 million in profit generated within a month\nfrom May 2023 to June 2023 [6]. Although a lower-bound, these estimates already highlight\nthe significance of MEV as a powerful incentive on Ethereum, emphasizing its consideration\nin design decisions to prevent consensus destabilizing attacks [17, 28, 32].\nMEV\u2019s negative implications are manifold [42], with issues including user value loss,\nnetwork congestion due to MEV searchers competing [20], value disparities among blocks\nincentivising consensus destabilising attacks [17], and centralisation of MEV supply chain\ncomponents due to economies of scale [37]. In response, innovative solutions are emerging\nacross different system layers [42]. These include fair transaction ordering protocols [13, 25],\nprivacy-preserving mechanisms to protect valuable transaction information of users [8, 24, 43],\nefficient MEV extraction designs that facilitate flow across different stakeholders [11, 23],\nand MEV-aware applications providing user rebates [1, 4, 8]. For a comprehensive analysis\nof the MEV mitigation space and existing solutions, we refer the reader to [42].\n2.4\nProposer-Builder Separation and MEV-Boost\nProposer-Builder Separation (PBS) is a novel design concept introduced for Ethereum\nto address the potential risk of validators becoming excessively sophisticated in block\nconstruction [14, 15]. This approach introduces a clear division of tasks within the block\nproduction process, assigning separate roles to proposers and builders. The core responsibility\nof the proposer revolves around consensus participation, while the intricate task of block\nconstruction is outsourced to specialised builders. By integrating PBS into Ethereum\u2019s core\nprotocol, validators can function solely as consensus nodes and source the execution payload\nfrom the builder\u2019s market on the execution layer. This enables validators to profit from\nMEV available in the mempool without direct involvement in the complexities of block\nbuilding. This shifts the competition for MEV and its inherent centralising influences from\nthe validator level, closely related to the consensus layer, to the builder level, primarily\nassociated with the execution layer.\nWithin the framework of PBS, builders are involved in a competitive environment where\nthey strive to offer the maximum value to proposers. Their bidding capacity depends on\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "b1b1fa2f-3cc8-4653-894c-28406275ec01": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1b1fa2f-3cc8-4653-894c-28406275ec01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "7", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B.

Determining the optimal set of transactions or bundles that yield the\nhighest value necessitates using complex algorithms, which may consume significant energy\nresources. Builders willingly undergo this computational cost to secure a monopoly over a\nsingle slot duration without engaging in staking or, previously, mining activities as consensus\nparticipants do.\nYet, the successful integration of PBS into the Ethereum core protocol relies on addressing\nthe complexities surrounding trust assumptions and commitments between proposers and\nbuilders [27]. As a temporary PBS solution, Flashbots introduced MEV-Boost [11], which\nemploys relays [12] as intermediaries between proposers and builders. Relays gather blocks\nfrom builders in the form of bids, validate them, and present them to proposers. Consequently,\nthey function as a data availability layer, safeguarding proposers from Denial-of-Service\n(DoS) attacks stemming from excessive bid submissions.\nWhile PBS aims to counteract the centralising impacts of MEV, MEV-Boost leads to\nnew censorship-related risks, as relays could selectively withhold bids from certain builders\nto specific proposers. However, in the absence of reliable relays, proposers can turn to their\nexecution clients for local block building. Hence, in the MEV-Boost architecture, relay\ncompetition promotes honest behaviour as their activities are subject to public auditability.\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of MEV-Boost [3] is designed around three key players:\nvalidators, who control the proposers, relays, and builders, who prepare the execution\npayloads. To qualify for receiving execution payloads from builders, validators need to\nregister with their chosen relays and provide details such as the payment address, block gas\nlimit, and their public key [12]. The block proposal process then unfolds as follows, when a\nvalidator is scheduled to propose a block [5, 33]:\n1. Builders, beginning from the preceding slot, check if the validator for the forthcoming\nslot is registered with a relay they submit bids to. If so, they start assembling execution\npayloads using transactions from the public mempool and their private order flow, if it\nexists.\n2. Builders then forward the prepared execution payload, along with their bid for the\nvalidator, to the relays they work with.\n3. Once the relays receive the submitted payloads, they validate them and make them\navailable for the validator.\n4. The validator\u2019s MEV-Boost middleware collects headers and associated bids from the\nregistered relays and provides the validator with the header offering the highest value.\n5. The validator blindly signs the header and sends it back to the MEV-Boost middleware,\nwhich forwards it to the relevant relay.\n6. The relay then verifies the validator\u2019s signature on the signed header and propagates the\ncomplete block to the rest of the network.\nMEV-Boost Analytics\nFollowing the merge in September 2022, MEV-Boost has risen to\nprominence as the primary solution for validators\u2019 block production. Analysis and data\npresented in [9, 39, 40] clearly showcase the widespread adoption of MEV-Boost among\nblock proposers. As of November 2022, the proportion of blocks produced by MEV-Boost\nutilising validators persistently exceeds 85%, even peaking beyond 90% by June 2023 [40].\nThe remaining validators presumably depend on local block construction via their execution\nclients.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "6fe17bc9-76d6-4b2e-9ef6-2b5e45c69c5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fe17bc9-76d6-4b2e-9ef6-2b5e45c69c5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "8", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "8\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\nThe adoption of MEV-Boost has triggered substantial compensations for validators,\nsurpassing an aggregate of 215k ETH [40].\nHowever, it is important to note that the\nMEV-Boost ecosystem has exhibited a degree of centralisation. Presently, ten active relays\nparticipate in MEV-Boost, with Ultra Sound Relay, Flashbots, Agnostic, and BloXRoute Max\nProfit contributing significantly to the block production, constituting 32%, 25%, 17%, and\n10% respectively [40]. This centralisation around specific relays can be attributed to the\npositive reputation and trust placed in these relays by both builders and validators.\nAdditionally, a centralisation trend is evident within the builder market as well. Four\nleading block builders-Flashbots, Beaverbuild, Builder0x69, and rsync-build-cumulatively\naccount for nearly 75% of all MEV-Boost blocks [40]. This pattern suggests that certain\nbuilders may have access to exclusive order flow in addition to the transactions available in\nthe public mempool.\n3\nData Collection and Processing\nTo comprehensively analyse the impact of waiting times on the value accrued by proposers,\nattestations, and consensus stability, we collected data from the MEV-Boost protocol and the\nEthereum consensus layer. Our methodology involved leveraging the public data endpoints\npresented by the MEV-Boost relays, which furnish information regarding submitted builder\nbids3 and proposed blocks4. Our data extraction process primarily focused on three dominant\nrelays [40]: Ultra Sound, Flashbots5, and Agnostic. Specifically, we procured bid and proposed\nblock data covering a slot range from 6 087 501 to 6 100 000, constituting 12,500 slots during\nthe time frame of March 27 to 28, 2023.\nTo fetch the consensus-related data such as\nattestations, forked blocks, and consensus rewards, we utilised the API endpoints provided\nby beaconcha.in6.\nWe leveraged the builder overview found in mevboost.pics7 to identify the builders.\nNotably, some builders adopt a strategy to submit identical bids (those with matching block\nhash and value) repetitively until the conclusion of the block auction. Builders are also\nobserved to be submitting the same bid to multiple relays to enhance their selection likelihood.\nWe aimed to pinpoint unique bids in our time-based bid value analysis, which necessitated\nthe removal of duplicates within a single relay and across multiple relays. For each relay, the\narrival time of a bid was identified by its first appearance, and we disregarded subsequent\nduplications from the same builder for the same slot. When aggregating bids across all relays,\nthe earliest bid from any relay was considered to be the first, thereby indicating the initial\ncontribution of a particular bid.\nAcross the range of all analysed slots, we discovered an average of 81, 119, and 47 duplicate\nbids per slot submitted to Agnostic, Ultra Sound, and Flashbots, respectively, resulting in an\noverall average of 83 duplicates. The sheer volume of submissions-with each relay receiving an\naverage of 647 bids per slot-underscored the necessity for accurate identification and removal\nof these duplicate bids, a step critical to upholding the accuracy of our results. Figure 9\nlocated in Appendix A provides an example of how the duplicate bids are distributed within\na particular slot for each relay.\n3 https://flashbots.github.io/relay-specs/#/Data/getReceivedBids\n4 https://flashbots.github.io/relay-specs/#/Data/getDeliveredPayloads\n5 For\nFlashbots\nbids\nand\nblocks,\nwe\nalso\nused\nthe\ndata\ndumps\navailable\nat\nhttps://\nflashbots-boost-relay-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html\n6 https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/docs/index.html\n7 https://mevboost.pics\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "66c80394-e371-4dc2-85ec-9902f54ecfcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "66c80394-e371-4dc2-85ec-9902f54ecfcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "9", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B.

Leveraging datasets from the MEV-Boost protocol and the Ethereum consensus\nlayer, we compiled a robust dataset that encapsulates block production activity over a specific\nperiod. Our analysis spotlights essential elements such as the value of waiting, the relative\nimportance of MEV rewards versus consensus protocol proposal rewards, and the relationship\nbetween timing, attestation shares, and block orphaning likelihood.\nMoreover, we utilise an agent-based simulation model tailored for PoS-Ethereum to\ninspect how waiting strategies influence emerging consensus properties. This approach allows\nus to examine system behaviour and dynamics when a set percentage of validators engage in\nwaiting games, adopting diverse delay durations. Ultimately, we strive to address the central\nquestion: can waiting games be played without disrupting consensus?\n4.1\nThe Value of Waiting\nIn the context of PoS-Ethereum, a validator selected to propose a block holds a monopoly for\nthe duration of their allocated slot. While honest validator specs compliance would require\nproposing a block immediately at the slot\u2019s beginning (at 0ms), a positive correlation between\nvalue and time may motivate rational proposers to postpone their block proposal. This\nsection delves into the exploration of value of time and scrutinises the significance of MEV\nrewards in comparison to proposal rewards from consensus. The goal is to assess whether\nthe strategic delay in block proposals provides a substantial advantage.\n4.1.1\nThe Evolution of Value over Time\nIn order to comprehend the potential value of delay for proposers, we have tracked the bids\nsubmitted across the three relays under consideration: Ultra Sound, Flashbots, and Agnostic.\nInitially, we consider all distinct builder bids submitted across these relays, aggregating them\nfor slot 6 093 815. Figure 1 dissects the distribution of bids, which are represented as dots\nand colour-coded based on the submitting builder. The relation between their arrival time at\nthe relay and their associated value is examined. The study uncovers a distinct upward trend\nin bid values over time. It is important to note that we measure the arrival time relative to\nthe start time of the slot; therefore, any negative time value indicates that the bid arrived\nduring the previous slot. With this in mind, the earliest recorded bid arrived at -10905ms\nwith a value of 0.014 ETH. On the other hand, the winning bid chosen at 299ms had a\nmuch higher value of 0.046 ETH. This represents a substantial increase of approximately\n228% from the initial bid, demonstrating the significant potential advantages of waiting.\nIt is observed that different builders adopt distinct strategies, such as Flashbots builders\nsubmitting approximately every 0.5s since the start time of the previous slot, in contrast to\nrsync-builder.xyz or Bob the Builder, who only commence submissions after a specific point\nin time.\nThis increase in value is attributable to the expanding public transaction pool, and\npotentially private order flow, that builders observe over time. As new transactions and\nbundles are successively submitted by regular users and MEV searchers, builders have access\nto a larger set of opportunities from which to construct their blocks. As a result, they can\noffer increased value to the validators. The escalating number of transactions included in the\nbuilder blocks, as demonstrated in Figure 2, further substantiates this.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "725c3ca1-5258-4ee1-b9a8-af181cd8d355": {"__data__": {"id_": "725c3ca1-5258-4ee1-b9a8-af181cd8d355", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "10", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "10\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\n-10000\n-9000\n-8000\n-7000\n-6000\n-5000\n-4000\n-3000\n-2000\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\nBuilder Block Arrival Time (ms)\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\nBlock Bid (ETH)\nunknown\nFlashbots\nbeaverbuild.org\nbuilder0x69\nrsync-builder.xyz\nTitan Builder\nBloXroute\nBuildAI\nhttps://eth-builder.com\nlightspeedbuilder.info\nBob the builder\nnfactorial.xyz\nIt's Free Real Estate\nGambit Labs\nWinner Bid (builder0x69, 0.046 ETH)\nSlot Start\nFigure 1 The distribution of unique builder blocks, based on their arrival time to the relay and\ntheir corresponding bid value, which were submitted by builders for slot 6 093 815.

To\naccurately capture value progression, we residualized the bid values against slot and builder\nfixed effects, which might cause artificial value fluctuations due to high or low MEV regimes,\nas discussed in [33]. Following this, we performed a linear regression on these residualized\nbid values relative to time, revealing a positive marginal value of 5.71 \u00d7 10\u22126 ETH/ms. This\nsupports our initial observation from a single slot, reaffirming that by prolonging their wait\ntime, validators can enhance their MEV payments.\n4.1.2\nThe Significance of Waiting\nAlthough we noted a positive marginal value of delay, if the rewards gained from waiting are\ninsignificant compared to the consensus protocol rewards issued for block proposals, then it\nmight not be worth risking the consensus in the first place. To scrutinise the relationship\nbetween the rewards from waiting (i.e., MEV rewards) and the proposal rewards from\nconsensus, we examined 5,726 proposed blocks from the relays we have monitored. These\nblocks belonged to three different epoch ranges between June 1, 2023, and June 11, 2023.\nWhile we used the MEV reward data provided by the relays, we fetched the consensus\nrewards validators received for their proposals from the beaconcha.in API.\nIn Figure 3, we analyse three distinct epoch ranges, each containin around 80 epochs on\naverage.

This timestamp signifies the exact moment when the\nproposer called for the block header (hence the winning bid) from the relay. Comparing this\ntime with the arrival time of the highest value bid could yield more precise figures regarding\nthe total unrealised value and the time difference between winning bids and highest value\nbids. As this data is not publicly accessible, we resorted to using bid arrival times, which\nstill provide valuable insight.\n4.1.4\nPlaying the Game Rationally\nOur research thus far has uncovered considerable incentives for rational validators within\nthe Ethereum network to participate in waiting games. However, the manner in which these\nstrategies are employed differs from relay to relay. In the default relay implementation [12],\neach builder bid undergoes a simulation to confirm its validity before it is made accessible\nto the proposer. This process introduces an average latency of 140ms [18], shortening the\nduration of the block auction and reducing the number of competing bids. To counter this\nlatency, the optimistic relay design has been proposed [29], and adopted by the Ultra Sound\nRelay. Under the optimistic approach, it is presumed that builders are submitting valid\nblocks, which are instantaneously made available while the validation is delayed. However,\nthis strategy necessitates that builders deposit funds upfront, securing payment for the\nvalidator if the builder fails to deliver the promised block or payment.\nIn examining 12,500 slots, we verified the positive influence of optimistic relaying on\nlatency reduction. Out of these slots, 9,250 were relayed using at least one of the three\nrelays we studied8. Table 1 displays the distribution of block deliveries across the relays.\nNotably, Ultra Sound Relay, known for its adoption of optimistic relaying, garnered the most\nbids per slot and delivered the highest quantity of blocks with the largest median value.\nAdditionally, Ultra Sound reported the latest median winning bid arrival time. A more\ndetailed distribution of winning bid timings can be found in Appendix B.\nTable 1 Summary of Relay Performance Metrics for the Slot Range 6 087 501-6 100 000.\nRelay\nBlocks\nAvg.

The ultimate consequence is an increasing trend of block auctions being\nclinched by higher-value, late-submitted bids, thereby augmenting the rewards for validators.\nWhile no direct evidence of validators partaking in waiting games has been identified [33],\nour analysis of 12,500 slots, along with the extensive historical data provided in [40], confirms\nthat validators strategically act to maximise their profits from MEV-Boost by registering\nwith relays which deliver the most value. Currently, Ultra Sound Relay leads the pack,\n8 A builder may have submitted the same winning bid to multiple relays.

Although a validator enjoys a monopoly during their slot duration, the ultimate\nconfirmation of the block can hinge on the attestations it gathers from the attestors in\nthe respective slot committees. If a block is proposed too late for attestors to vote on it,\nthese attestors might opt to vote on its parent block instead. Under such circumstances,\na block securing less than 40% of attestations is exposed to the risk of being forked out\nby the following slot\u2019s proposer, using proposer-boost as outlined in Ethereum consensus\nspecifications [2]. In this section, we delve into the analysis of attestation shares for the\nproposed blocks and identify those susceptible to forking. We contrast orphaned blocks with\ntheir non-orphaned counterparts to comprehend the potential impact of timing. Moreover,\nwe employ an agent-based model to simulate Ethereum consensus, which allows us to observe\nconsensus stability when a specific portion of validators engage in waiting games, with varying\ndegrees of delay times.\n4.2.1\nAttestation Shares\nExpanding on the analysis in [33] about the share of attestations included in the subsequent\nslot of a proposed block, we examine the next slot attestation shares for the blocks within\nour data set. We focus on the relationship between the winning bid arrival time to the relay,\nthe attained attestation share, and the vulnerability to being forked out by the next slot\nproposer through the proposer-boost mechanism [2].\nRecalling that the fork choice protocol, LMD-Ghost, computes a block\u2019s weight as the\ncumulative effective balances of validators who attested to the block in a prior slot as an\nattestation for a block at slot n is only included starting from slot n + 1, plus the weight\ncoming from the parent block, we assess the impact of the proposer-boost mechanism. This\nmechanism instantaneously assigns a 40% committee weight to a timely block proposed\nwithin the first 4 seconds of a slot, derived from the total effective balance of validators\nassigned for that slot, thereby enabling a potential re-organisation (re-org) of a lower-weight\npast block. To analyse the relationship between this re-org vulnerability and the winning\nbuilder block\u2019s arrival timing, we measure each block\u2019s share of attestations included in the\nsucceeding slot. This involves calculating the block\u2019s weight (presuming a uniform effective\nbalance of 32 ETH for each validator) and normalising against the slot\u2019s committee weight,\nwhich yields the share of attestations a block has accrued from the total potential attestations.\nAny block with an attestation share below 40% in the subsequent slot is deemed susceptible\nto a re-org through the proposer-boost.\nOur results highlight that, on average, blocks gather 98% of attestation shares in the\nfollowing slot. Out of the 8,121 distinct blocks proposed by the relays under our analysis,\nonly 27 blocks acquired under 40% shares, with a median arrival time for winning bids\nof 1223ms. Remarkably, we observed 75 blocks that arrived later than the 1223ms mark\nyet accrued sufficient shares to be unaffected by the proposer-boost, with an average share\nof 90%. This analysis is visually represented in Figure 5, where each blue dot stands for\na block, and those within the red region identify blocks vulnerable to a re-org using the\nproposer-boost, based on their attestation share in the subsequent slot.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "d8d7665e-2b8f-472d-8bfa-515ee9070e5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8d7665e-2b8f-472d-8bfa-515ee9070e5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "15", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B.

Each blue dot denotes a unique block, with those in the\nred region indicating blocks vulnerable to getting forked out by the next slot\u2019s block proposer due\nto receiving less than 40% attestation share.\nWe further examined the relationship between the arrival times of winning bids in\nconsecutive slots and the accrued attestation shares. As depicted in Figure 6, each dot\ncorresponds to a block, with its x and y-coordinates representing the arrival times of its own\nand its following slot\u2019s winning bids, respectively. Blocks are colour-coded based on their\nattestation shares in the following slot. Our results revealed a tendency for attestation shares\nto decrease when a block\u2019s winning bid is delayed while the succeeding slot\u2019s winning bid\narrives in a timely manner. Specifically, we identified 23 blocks vulnerable to the proposer-\nboost with attestation shares under 40% and a following slot\u2019s winning bid arriving within\nthe initial 4s. Nevertheless, these blocks remained in the canonical chain, implying that the\npotential proposer-boost re-org was not exploited.\n4.2.2\nOrphaned Blocks\nIn our final empirical data analysis, we delved into the occurrence of orphaned blocks within\nour slot range and its correlation with the timing of the winning bid arrivals. We discovered\n151 slots, amounting to roughly 1.2% of all slots we have analyzed, where a block failed to\nbe included in the canonical chain. Among these, 123 slots had missed proposals, while 28\nslots featured orphaned blocks, half of which stemmed from MEV-Boost and the other half\nwere locally built by validators. Figure 11 in Appendix C illustrates the distribution of these\norphaned blocks across relays.\nWhen we compared the timings of winning bids for both orphaned and non-orphaned\nblocks, Figure 7 reveal that the winning bid for the earliest orphaned block was submitted\n271ms prior to the slot start. We identified a total of 5,631 blocks with winning bids arriving\nafter this point that made it to the canonical chain. Orphaned blocks displayed a median\nproposal time of 1115ms, contrasting with the non-orphaned blocks\u2019 median time of 155ms.\nInterestingly, 130 of these non-orphaned blocks had winning bids arriving later than the\nmedian time of the orphaned blocks.\nThese observations lead us to two key insights: firstly, orphaning is a relatively rare event,\noccurring in approximately 0.22% of the 12,500 slots.

In this section, we present an\nagent-based model to study a scenario where a consistent share of the validators follows the\nsame delay strategy: whenever a delaying validator is selected as a block proposer, they wait\nuntil a certain time (which is the same across delayers) into the slot to release the block.\nThey do this to maximise their MEV: from what we observed in the previous sections, there\nis a good reason to think that MEV rewards correlate positively with the interval between\nthe block release and the previous block release. For this simulation, we are not interested in\nestimating the actual amount of increased profit these delayer validators would accrue, as we\nhave already shown that it would be positive. Here we want to observe the eventual fall-out\nof such a family of strategies on the overall consensus strategy: we want to observe if such\nstrategies may decrease the number of blocks included in the mainchain, which we assume to\nbe an indicator of the consensus efficiency of a blockchain.\nThe framework we refer to is essentially the same presented in [26]: the agents are\nvalidators, connected on a peer-to-peer network generated following the Erdos-Renyi random\nmodel [21]. Time is assumed to be continuous and divided into slots; validators are randomly\nselected to be block proposers for each slot, and because they are assumed to be fully honest,\nthey release the block exactly at the beginning of the assigned slot. The remaining validators\nare selected as attestors: they release an attestation to certify on the blockchain that they\nreceived the block from the block proposer and that it is valid. If they do not receive the block\nbefore the 4 seconds threshold, they are allowed to attest for the previous head of the chain.\nThe only two random events that may happen are block gossiping and attestation gossiping,\nwhich follow exponential waiting times of parameters \u03c4block and \u03c4attestation.\nGossiping\nevents happen when an agent is randomly picked to communicate the information about\nthe blocks/attestations they received to one of their neighbour agents, picked at random as\nwell. In [26], the authors showed how a phase transition in consensus efficiency is observed\nbecause of \u03c4block: when the value becomes larger than a certain threshold depending on the\ntopological properties of the peer-to-peer network, the number of blocks included in the\nmainchain declines abruptly. In the present work, we increase the number of parameters to\ntake into account the delay strategy as part of the waiting games. We introduce xd \u2208 [0, 1]\nthe share of agents who are actively following the delay strategy, and td \u2208 [0, 12] which is the\nactual delay the delayers wait from the start of the slot before releasing the block.\nWe proceed by generating a sample of simulations where we vary xd and td, while we\nkeep fixed \u03c4block = \u03c4attestation = 3 and the peer-to-peer topology, as well as the simulation\ntime.\nAs measures we care to observe, we consider the mainchain Rate \u00b5, from [26], to estimate\nthe consensus efficiency, formally defined as:\n\u00b5 = |M|\n|B|\n(3)\nwhere |M| is the number of blocks included in the canonical mainchain(M) while |B| is the\ntotal number of blocks produced during the simulation.\nThe second measure we consider is the orphan rate of the blocks produced by the delayers\n\u0398d, which we use to proxy, on the one hand, the rewards missed by the delayers and, on the\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "aab4949e-28b4-492c-bdf7-1789db2f9195": {"__data__": {"id_": "aab4949e-28b4-492c-bdf7-1789db2f9195", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "18", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "18\nThe Role of Time in MEV Rewards\nother hand, the direct damage to a consensus as a consequence of the delaying strategy.\n\u0398d = |{b /\u2208 M\ns.t.\nproposer(b) \u2208 D}|\n(4)\nwhere D is the set of agents who follow the delayer strategy and proposer(b) represents the\nagent who proposed block b.\nSimulations results are plotted in Figure 8 and the results are intuitive: the effect of the\ntime delay exercised by the delayers does not significantly affect consensus until it becomes\nlarger than the slot time minus the latency time: 12 \u2212 3 = 9 (the latency also represents\nthe average time between two consecutive gossip interactions between the same two nodes).\nWe also observe that the effect of the share of delayer stops increasing around xd = 0.5, at\nwhich the number of consecutive mixed blocks (delayer blocks followed by honest blocks) is\nmaximum.

We found\nsubstantial incentives for validators to deviate from the honest validator specifications,\nprimarily due to the emerging incentive, the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).\nThe Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) implementation by Flashbots, MEV-Boost, have\npermitted validators to outsource block building to a competitive market of builders. This\nchange has had a significant impact on the dynamics of block proposal strategies. Our results\nconfirm that MEV rewards, which increase over time as more transactions arrive, dominate\nconsensus proposal rewards, which provides sufficient incentive for validators to delay their\nblock proposals - essentially playing the waiting game.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "d358b378-af4e-47e2-bfc0-e8a659a7596c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d358b378-af4e-47e2-bfc0-e8a659a7596c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 23, "source": "19", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Time Moves Faster When There is Nothing You Anticipate: The Role of Time in MEV Rewards", "authors": "Burak \u00d6z, Benjamin Kraner, Nicol\u00f2 Vallarano, Bingle Stegmann Kruger, Florian Matthes, Claudio Juan Tessone", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05814v1", "release_date": "2023-07-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "B. \u00d6z, B.

Our data\ndemonstrates that while late blocks tend to accrue fewer attestation shares, not all late\nblocks are at risk of orphaning. In fact, orphaning is a relatively rare event, occurring in\nonly 0.22% of cases in our study.\nWe further analyzed the impact of waiting games on consensus stability using an agent-\nbased simulation model, simulating a range of delaying behaviours by validators in various\nscenarios. Our findings indicate that a delay strategy, if adopted by enough validators, can\nbe profitable without leading to consensus degradation.\nIn conclusion, our empirical data analysis and simulation results indicate that the risks\nassociated with delaying proposals are outweighed by the potential benefits, given the\ncurrent dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism and MEV. Looking forward, we aim to\nfurther examine the interactions among builders, relays, and validators, particularly in terms\nof the latencies introduced during these interactions. We hope this will enable a better\nunderstanding of how waiting games can be optimized for validators, while ensuring a more\ncompetitive block auction for builders.\nReferences\n1\nCoW protocol.

Welcome back to the built on\nBitcoin podcast where we cover everything going on in\nthe stacks ecosystem. I'm a broken record, but that's\nwhat we do here. And this is a this week in Stacks\nepisode. So we're covering everything that happened\nin the past week or so. I'm your host, Jake\nblockchain. And yeah, let's just jump right into it.\nActually was a pretty busy week.\n00:00:27.414 - 00:01:04.826, Speaker A: Last week was\nkind of slow and I kind of chalked it up to like\nwe're in a build mode. Everyone just heads down doing\ntheir thing. But there's a ton to talk about today\nbecause everyone's been building and now things are\ntrickling out. So first on the list is hyperchains. I\nannounced last week on the episode that hyperchains\nhad hit Testnet, and that was from a tweet that munib\nand Trevor posted. But there was also a corresponding\nblog post and it goes into some of what you can\nexpect from hyperchains. First of all, it is live on\nTestnet.\n00:01:04.826 - 00:01:53.546, Speaker A: It's building\nblocks, it's doing the things. And they now have it\nslated for the first test case using some kind of\nNFT. I don't know if that's going to be plugged into\none of the current marketplaces and some kind of\nspecial collab or they're going to do something very\ndistinct to try it out. But next month, in July,\nthey're going to try the first use cases where you\ncan actually go on. And they also made it known in\nthis blog post how you're going to use hyperchains,\nmeaning how you're going to get assets to and from\nit. And what it will look like is you will send\nassets in a transaction over to the hyperchain. And\nthen when you want to interact with those assets,\nyou're going to change your network.\n00:01:53.546 - 00:02:44.238, Speaker A: So if you've\nused testnet before, you go into your hero wallet and\non that top right button, you hit it and it will say\nswitch account, create account. And usually you'll\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "8254c5c9-5de9-4c0f-b813-d07b40c9ea4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8254c5c9-5de9-4c0f-b813-d07b40c9ea4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "2", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E63: Weekly - Hyperchains, Web3Week, Ryan Shea , NFT Marketplace updates, NoCodeClarity, NeoSwap", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0ZtGxAPII", "release_date": "2022-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "use that to switch accounts so you can hide your NFTs\non some sub account so that your main BTC looks\nbeautiful and sexy. But that third or fourth option\ndown, it says change network and it's usually on main\nnet by default. And if you were say, using the Alex\ntestnet back when they were stress testing the\ncontracts, that's how you would get access to Alex\nback then you would click change network and go from\nMainnet to Testnet. That's how you're going to use\nhyperchains. So a new option will be there called\nhyperchains, and you'll switch that network. And then\nwhen you log into a site that has hyperchain\nfunctionality, that's how you'll interface with the\nnetwork.\n00:02:44.238 - 00:03:16.310, Speaker A: So that was\nnew. Super interesting. Also, they released a roadmap\nand I'll drop it into the description below if you\nwant to review it. But there were some notable things\non there. One was next month is the first test case,\nbut also for the rest of the year they're aiming for\nQ one next year of an official launch, and I think\nthis is the first I've seen it. But stacks 2.1 is\nslated for December, so that brings the potential.\n00:03:16.310 - 00:03:56.930, Speaker A: The biggest\nthings it's going to bring, as far as I know, is\nupgrades to clarity, so devs will have more\nfunctionality to play with. And what that means\nthrough some of those new tools is that we'll most\nlikely get stacks mining pools finally. So there's\nsome increased functions coming. I've heard this from\nseeing different blog posts, talking to Zan in past\ninterviews, that there's some of the things you need\nin clarity 2.1 that make it so much easier to run a\ndecentralized mining pool. So that's exciting. I\nthink it also increases some of the connections to\nbitcoin.\n00:03:56.930 - 00:04:21.594, Speaker A: So December,\nstacks 2.1 is slated to come out. That's huge. Next\non the list. I had a fantastic interview with John\nEnos, who is the founder of Neoswap.

Basically, they're\ntrying to unlock liquidity across all kinds of\nmarkets.\n00:04:21.594 - 00:05:11.950, Speaker A: It's really\ninsane. And they're starting with digital assets,\nnamely nfts. And they're doing these things called\nNeoswap parties, where you log into a party, you set\nyour budget, you choose some nfts you want to put up\nfor trade, and then the party starts. You can pick\nfrom NFTs people have put up it, uses some special AI\nalgorithm and then finds the perfect multi way trade\ndepending on everyone who's in the room. So it could\nbe like, you get one, I give three, they give me\nmoney, and you can just make this perfect trade.\nAnyway, John is currently in the stacks accelerator.\nHe has a mathematics background and yeah, I mean,\nit's one of those things where if you haven't tried\nNeoswap yet, no matter how much I sell you on it,\nit's not going to hit till you try it.\n00:05:11.950 - 00:05:44.106, Speaker A: So I'll say,\nlisten to that interview just to get you kind of\nexcited about what to expect. But if you haven't\njoined a neo swap party. But yeah, I dropped that\nlast Friday. Thank you to John for coming on. Next\nup, project Indigo. This is the AI, not AI, the NFT\ncollection that's also an interactive game. And they\nreleased the first two chapters a few months ago and\nthey've just been kind of heads down since then.\n00:05:44.106 - 00:06:20.680, Speaker A: And the way\nthey were building, I guess, wasn't working. It was\nhard to always kind of like ship the next chapter\njust in time. So they've been working a ton on more\ncontinuous story mode features and they're starting\nto come to life. So they dropped a trailer which you\ncan hit the link below to watch. But you can also go\nto projectindigonft.com. And now you'll see an\ninteractive map on the homepage and you can click it\nand you're starting to see more things pop up.

There's like collection Trader\nview, order book and something else. You can click\nTrader view and it will give you a whole suite of\nfeatures that you could sort by. And one of the\ncooler ones is you can see a live view of how much\nnfts have been trading for in that collection over a\nset period of time. So you can see a window of like\nin the past seven days. How many of these NFTs have\nsold? Like are they moving? And then what's their\nprice range? And you can see it just super easy.\n00:07:15.750 - 00:07:44.420, Speaker A: You can\nhighlight it, see the NFT, click on it, get more\ndetails, watch its price action. So if you're an NFT\ntrader and you're doing this, you want to get data\nreal quick. This is a fantastic, fantastic feature.\nSo that was cool to see. And then on Gamma, Gamma's\ndropped a bunch of new features as well. One is you\ncan now make offers on nfTs, which is cool. So now\nyou don't just have to wait for someone to list it.\n00:07:44.420 - 00:08:15.930, Speaker A: You can go to\nany collection and any NFT and submit an offer. And\nthis is great. I've been trying to snag a couple\nwhere I literally will go find that person's BTC\nbecause you can just look and highlight it and I'll\nsend them a small amount of stacks like one stack or\ntwo stack. And in the memo page I'll be like, hey,\ncan I buy your NFT? And I have a 0% hit rate. It's\nalso expensive. I'm wasting stacks clogging the\nnetwork. Now I don't have to do that.\n00:08:15.930 - 00:09:05.286, Speaker A: So Gamma has\nthat built in. You can submit an offer, and within\nthat offer you can leave a message so you can kind of\nsell yourself on like, hey, I'm a really good guy,\nI'll take good care of this NFT and then submit that\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "28274fb4-8472-4af7-a02f-b2c74d05c1e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "28274fb4-8472-4af7-a02f-b2c74d05c1e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "5", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E63: Weekly - Hyperchains, Web3Week, Ryan Shea , NFT Marketplace updates, NoCodeClarity, NeoSwap", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0ZtGxAPII", "release_date": "2022-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "bid. So that's new. And then you can also now sort\nnot just by the usual high low rarity, but you can\nfilter by different categories or different. You can\nadd filters while you're sorting, so you can add a\nsort by high to low and under 1000 facts. Before, you\ncouldn't do that, so that's cool. And then they also\ndropped some new features around clarity on minting.\n00:09:05.286 - 00:09:49.450, Speaker A: So if you go\nto a collection page and it's still currently\nminting, you couldn't tell before you had to go to a\nseparate part of the site, which is like the crate\nportal. And it would say minting now these\ncollections. But on the main site it would just show\nas there's 70 pieces or 100 pieces that are live and\nyou could review them now on the main site, you can\nsee if it's minting currently and click directly into\nthat part of the site and partake if you hold a\nwhitelist or if it's public mint. So props to gamma,\nprops to byzantian. Love to see the healthy\ncompetition of the marketplaces. Yeah, super dope. So\nnext up on the list, we'll keep it going.\n00:09:49.450 - 00:10:08.720, Speaker A: Like I said,\nthere's some nuggets this week. We got a lot. Ryan\nShea, which is the co founder of Stacks, I've always\nheard that name. Didn't really see him much. It seems\nlike he just kind of like went and did his own thing\nfor a while. He's back now. The boy's back.\n00:10:08.720 - 00:10:45.210, Speaker A: He's also\njoined Stacks ventures as a board member, so he'll be\nadvising and helping teams. Obviously, I work there.\nI haven't heard much more besides the tweets that go\nout. I have not met the man yet, but cool to see the\nco founder of Stacks coming back into the mix. And\nhe's also been hitting the ground running as far as\nimprovement proposals. So there's been two that he's\nkind of like, started on the stacks forum. One is\nabout the stacking mechanism and one is about minor\ndecentralization.\n00:10:45.210 - 00:11:46.974, Speaker A: And I mean,\nthe miner issue has been one for a while, where we've\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "a8122c7d-bf1e-404a-9d4d-0bed33913165": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8122c7d-bf1e-404a-9d4d-0bed33913165", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "6", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E63: Weekly - Hyperchains, Web3Week, Ryan Shea , NFT Marketplace updates, NoCodeClarity, NeoSwap", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0ZtGxAPII", "release_date": "2022-06-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "seen between five and nine miners pretty much the\nentire time I've been in stacks for the past year,\nand it's hard to say that you're a decentralized\nchain when there's less than ten people that run this\nentire network.

Web three week just concluded. The\npast three days, there's been conferences going on\npretty much most of the day. The first one was it's\nNFT, which is about what it sounds like nfTs, but\nspecifically in investing and trading them. The\nsecond day was the Gamefi and Metaverse conference,\nwhich was headlined by Neil Stevenson giving an\namazing interview. He's the author of Snow Crash,\ninvented the word Metaverse.\n00:12:22.118 - 00:12:49.666, Speaker A: But yeah, so\nthat was cool. And then today, unmutable went on,\nwhich was the web3 music conference. And yeah, I\nwon't deep dive into any specifics. One, because I\nwas busy doing sax venture stuff, so I didn't get to\nparticipate too much. But there was just a ton that\nwent on. There was two stages across both, all three\ndays, I believe, but they are on YouTube. You can\nrewatch them.\n00:12:49.666 - 00:13:33.982, Speaker A: You're not\ngoing to miss out on anything.

So if you go to zero auth Dow on\nTwitter, just type that in and just look through\ntheir page.\n00:13:33.982 - 00:14:06.298, Speaker A: I mean, just\ntake a scroll, like scroll for a little bit, see what\ncatches your eye. But pretty much. Every single team\nin cohort two has either already been interviewed or\nwill be interviewed in the next two weeks. And so if\nyou want to get a good pulse of the 20 plus teams\nthat are coming out of that next cohort, zero\nauthority Dow is the place to go. So highly recommend\ntheir content.

No code clarity is\ntrying to do that for clarity. So there's an\napplication called Bubble. And Bubble is a no code\nwebsite, kind of like how you use a drag and drop\nwebsite builder.

But Dewalker, the\nCTO at hero, posted a blog post three weeks ago.\n00:17:54.482 - 00:18:52.022, Speaker A: So it just\nlike went under the radar somehow for me on Taro. So\nTaro was announced at Bitcoin Miami and it was\nproposed by the Lightning Labs team, which created\nspecification for lightning and it allows assets\nother than BTC to be on BTC. So this could be a\nstablecoin, an NFT altcoin, chipcoin, like all the\nabove. So he deep ish dives into what Taro is and\nback when it was announced, there was a little bit of\nfear that Taro and stacks might be at war with each\nother. And he just gives some points on how this is a\npositive sum game and what makes bitcoin stronger\nmakes stacks stronger. Taro can probably be\nintegrated into stacks in some way. So yeah, that was\na good blog post.\n00:18:52.022 - 00:19:20.830, Speaker A: I'll link\nthat below as well. I just wanted to bring it to your\nattention because if I missed it and I had my nose to\nthe ground pretty well, there's a good chance you\nmissed it too. So that's it.

The strategic behaviour of rational play-\ners, known as searchers, lead to MEV games that\nhave di\ufb00erent impacts and externalities in each do-\nmain. Several ordering mechanisms, which determine\nthe inclusion and position of transactions in a block,\nhave been considered to construct alternative games\nto organise MEV extraction, and minimize negative\nexternalities; examples include sealed bid auctions,\n\ufb01rst input \ufb01rst output, and private priority gas auc-\ntions. However, to date, no su\ufb03ciently formal and\nabstract de\ufb01nition of MEV games have been made.\nIn this paper, we take a step toward the formaliza-\ntion of MEV games and compare di\ufb00erent ordering\nmechanisms and their externalities.\nIn particular,\nwe attempt to formalize games that arise from com-\nmon knowledge MEV opportunities, such as arbitrage\nand sandwich attacks. In de\ufb01ning these games, we\nutilise a theoretical framework that provides ground-\nwork for several important roles and concepts, such\nas the searcher, sequencer, domain, and bundle. We\nalso introduce the price of MEV as the price of anar-\nchy of MEV games, a measure that provides formal\ncomparison between di\ufb00erent ordering mechanisms.\nKeywords:Blockchain, MEV, Game Theory, Price\nof Anarchy\n1\nIntroduction\nThe notion of miner-extractable value (MEV) intro-\nduced in [5], and formally de\ufb01ned in [3], measures the\nvalue that miners can extract by strategically order-\ning, censoring, and including transactions in a block.\nIn general, block proposers (typically validators or\nminers), have the power to dictate or in\ufb02uence the\ninclusion and ordering of pending transactions in a\nnew block. Thus, rational proposers have access to\nextra rewards per block. However as shown in [5], this\npower is not limited to block proposers. Blockchain\nusers and bots, usually termed searchers, can use\nstrategies like spamming transactions or outbidding\ncompetitors to extract MEV themselves. For this and\nother reasons, the term miner-extractable value has\nevolved to mean maximal extractable value, formally\nde\ufb01ned in [16], which does not limit extraction to\nblock proposers. We often refer to block proposers\nand searchers as players.\nDepending on the network protocol, which we refer\nto as the domain, and type of MEV being extracted,\nrational searchers have incentives to take di\ufb00erent ac-\ntions to increase their expected revenue. For exam-\nple, [5] showed that Ethereum, a network with higher\npropagation latency, incentivises searchers to widen\ntheir view of the mempool to outbid their competi-\ntors, while domains like Polygon PoS, where the prop-\nagation of transactions is probabilistic, incentivises\nsearchers to spam transactions to extract MEV. This\nmotivates a more general formulation of the MEV\ngame presented in [5] such that models of rational\nsearcher behaviour can be derived from a domain in-\nput.\n1.1\nOur contributions\nThe main goal of this paper is to formalise MEV\ngames with a \ufb01nite number of players under di\ufb00erent\n1\narXiv:2208.13464v1  [cs.GT]  29 Aug 2022\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "75dbd8b2-6a43-4ab2-b3f7-daf75519dfa4": {"__data__": {"id_": "75dbd8b2-6a43-4ab2-b3f7-daf75519dfa4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "2", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Price of MEV: Towards a Game Theoretical Approach to MEV", "authors": "Bruno Mazorra, Michael Reynolds, Vanesa Daza", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13464v1", "release_date": "2022-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "ordering mechanism and auction designs which are\nde\ufb01ned by various environment conditions and rules\nsuch as latency of players, PoW/PoS consensus, and\nmempool visibility.

In our de\ufb01ni-\ntion, we emphasize relative constraints like capi-\ntal, software resources, and view of the mempool.\n\u2022 We formally de\ufb01ne a more abstract and gen-\neral MEV game that provides a foundation for\nanalysing the incentives of searchers in di\ufb00erent\ndomains.\n\u2022 We also introduce di\ufb00erent negative externalities\nthat arise from MEV games, and we formally de-\n\ufb01ne the Price of Anarchy in MEV games under\ndi\ufb00erent cost functions as a way to quantify their\nimpact.\nWe explore the speci\ufb01c case of block\nspace misuse, which we refer to as the price of\nMEV, and compute this to characterize and clas-\nsify di\ufb00erent ordering mechanisms.\n1.2\nPrevious Work\nIn Flashboys 2.0 [5] Daian et al. proposed a formal-\nization of the priority gas auction (PGA) model and\nproved mathematically and empirically the existence\nof Grim-Trigger Nash equilibrium under certain con-\nditions. However, the results are limited to two play-\ners and the PoW Ethereum domain, and do not con-\nsider reverted transaction costs proportional to the\nbid or that players can engage in Sybil attacks. In\n[9], the authors explore the equilibrium of sandwich\nMEV as a router game.\nLikewise, in [18], the au-\nthors compare empirically the miner\u2019s revenue and\nthe searchers competition of arbitrage opportunities\nbefore and after the introduction of Flashbots MEV\nauctions on Ethereum. In [10], the \ufb01rst formalization\nof cross chain MEV was proposed. However, to the\nbest of our knowledge, there is no formal and empir-\nical study on the impacts of MEV on several distinct\ndomains.\n2\nTheoretical Framework\nIn general,\nminer or maximum extractive value\n(MEV) is a term that refers to any excess pro\ufb01ts\nthat a block proposer or searcher can make based\non transaction ordering and/or transaction inclusion.\nMEV was introduced in [5], formally de\ufb01ned in [3],\nand extended in cross-domain environments in [10].\nAnother similar de\ufb01nition was given in [16], except\nMEV was treated independently of a player.\nThe\nMEV opportunities we consider in this paper are lim-\nited to the pro\ufb01ts a player can obtain by modifying\nthe blockchain state. In this section, we will formalize\nthis kind of MEV opportunity using the concept of\npro\ufb01table \u2018bundles\u2019. Then, we will de\ufb01ne \u2018local\u2019 MEV\nas the maximally pro\ufb01table bundle a speci\ufb01c player\ncan construct. Similar to [10], we start by formally\nde\ufb01ning the domain and searcher:\nDe\ufb01nition 2.1. A domain D is a self-contained sys-\ntem with a globally shared state st.\nThis state is\naltered by various agents through actions (sending\ntransactions, constructing blocks, slashing, etc.), that\nexecute within a shared execution environment\u2019s se-\nmantics.\nEach domain has a prede\ufb01ned consensus\nprotocol that includes a set of valid algorithms to or-\nder transactions, denoted by prt(D).\nA blockchain is a domain, however, there are other\nnon-blockchain domains that also have MEV, like\ncentralized exchanges.\nDe\ufb01nition 2.2. A searcher (in general, we will call it\na player) in a domain D is a participant that assumes\nthat sequencers follow a speci\ufb01c set of rules and take\nstrategic actions (send bundles with speci\ufb01c bids) to\nmaximize their own utility. In general, we will assume\nthat a player\u2019s utility depends linearly on their token\nbalances.\nIn a domain D with state st, the update of the state\nst after executing transactions tx is given by st\u25cbtx.\nFor an ordered set of transactions B = {tx1,...,txl},\nwe have the composition st \u25cb B = st \u25cb tx1 \u25cb .... \u25cb txl.\nSimilar to [3], we use Addr to denote the set of all\npossible accounts and T to denote the set of all to-\nkens.\nWe de\ufb01ne b \u2236 A \u00d7 T \u2192 Z as the function\nthat maps a pair of, an account and a token, to\nits current balance.\nMore precisely, for a \u2208 Addr\nwe let b(a,\u22c5) denote the balance of all tokens held\nin a and b(a,T) denote the account balance of to-\nken T.\nAbusing notation, we will denote by b(a)\nthe value of b(a,\u22c5) priced by a num\u00b4eraire E. That\nis, if there is a pricing vector p = (pT \u2192E)T \u2208T, then\nb(a) = p \u22c5 b(a,\u22c5) = \u2211T \u2208T pT \u2192Eb(a,T).\nDe\ufb01nition 2.3. An ordering mechanism is a set of\nrules that determines the order and inclusion of a set\nof transactions in a block. More formally, let T be\nthe set of all transactions, an ordering mechanism is\na map or \u2236 P\u2264(T ) \u2192 P\u2264(T ), where P\u2264(T ) is the set\nof all ordered subsets of T , such that or(T) \u2286 T for\nall T \u2208 P\u2264(T ).\n2\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "3525fafd-6fcb-4c62-97ab-a7c81153cfc9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3525fafd-6fcb-4c62-97ab-a7c81153cfc9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "3", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Price of MEV: Towards a Game Theoretical Approach to MEV", "authors": "Bruno Mazorra, Michael Reynolds, Vanesa Daza", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13464v1", "release_date": "2022-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "De\ufb01nition 2.4. A sequencer is an agent of a domain\nresponsible for maintaining the liveness and consis-\ntency through a set of actions. We distinguish four\ntypes of sequencers: dummy, dummy Byzantine, ra-\ntional and partially rational. A sequencer is dummy\nif he follows the validator consensus protocol prt(D).\nA sequencer is dummy Byzantine if they misbehave,\nbut other nodes can detect his misconduct.\nA se-\nquencer is rational if it follows a set of valid actions\non the domain D to maximize its revenue (including\ndeviating from an ordering mechanism). Therefore, if\na player misbehaves to maximize their payo\ufb00 but can\nnot be identi\ufb01ed, punished, or slashed, we say that\nis a rational player. A sequencer is partially ratio-\nnal if they commit to using a speci\ufb01c valid ordering\nmechanism to maximize its payo\ufb00.\nOn Ethereum, miners are usually partially rational.\nIn general, miners run mev-geth, which receives a\nblock transaction ordering of highest revenue from\nthe Flashbots relayer. Rational sequencers could take\nthe Flashbots block and reorg to maximize their own\nrevenue.\nNevertheless, miners do not deviate from\nthe mev-geth intended protocol1.\nFor this reason,\nplayers participating in the MEV extraction are not\nnecessarily sequencers; they take a sequence of ac-\ntions to bias nodes to maximize their own revenue.\nThe set of actions that a sequencer can follow de-\npends on the domain and can include arbitrary ac-\ntions. Studying the impact that rational players and\nsequencers can have in a domain is helpful to bound\nthe set of actions. For example, in sel\ufb01sh mining [17]\nthe set of actions to construct or publish the private\nchains.\nFrom now on, we will assume that sequencers are par-\ntially rational. An example of an ordering mechanism\nis the default geth client, which uses a greedy approx-\nimation algorithm to optimize the blocks\u2019 transaction\nfee revenue.\nA sequencer receives a set of concurrent transactions\ntx1,...,txn with gas price m1,...,mn and g1,...,gn\nunits of gas.\nIf the sequencer includes txi, it ob-\ntains migi in fees. Since the gas used per block is\nrestricted in every domain by some constant L, the se-\nquencer must choose a subset of transactions T such\nthat \u2211i\u2236txi\u2208T gi \u2264 L. Then, a node that tries to maxi-\nmize its revenues per block needs to solve the follow-\ning Knapsack optimization problem, which we name\nKnapsack Extractable Value (KEV) problem:\n1However, recent miners are deviating from the Flashbots\nprotocol to extract more value. No formal or academic work\nhas proved this yet. These are statements from some Flashbots\nteam members.\nmax\nn\n\u2211\ni=1\nximigi\ns.t.\nn\n\u2211\ni=1\nxigi \u2264 L,\nxi \u2208 {0,1}.\nWe note by KEV(T ) the solutions\u2019 revenue of the\noptimization problem. Knapsack optimization prob-\nlems [15] are NP-complete; that is, no known polyno-\nmial time algorithm \ufb01nds an optimal solution. Thus,\neach sequencer usually chooses di\ufb00erent algorithms to\napproximate the optimal solution. For example, Par-\nity nodes order transactions by gas price m without\nconsidering the gas costs.\nAnother example is the Flashbots relayer, which uses\na greedy approximation algorithm [1], ordering trans-\nactions by the ratio of miner payment and gas con-\nsumed (a natural extension of ordering by gas price\ntaking into account direct payments and more than\none transaction).\nHowever, the problem that the\nFlashbots relayer tries to solve is quite di\ufb00erent, since\nit does not include reverted transactions or compet-\ning bundles. Moreover, we proved (see C) that there\nare examples where this algorithm does not produce a\ngood approximation. In [2], the authors reformulate\nthe block production as a linear programming prob-\nlem without taking into account competing bundles.\nWe will give more details after de\ufb01ning bundles.\nNow that we have settled up some ground de\ufb01nitions,\nwe will focus next on the formalization of the extrac-\ntion of MEV opportunities. To simplify the games,\nwe will not consider the complete MEV extraction\nper block, but separate the MEV opportunities into\n\u201cindependent/concurrent\u201d ones.\nDe\ufb01nition 2.5. Let P be the set of all players. A set\nof transactions T = {tx1,...,txk} and a state st in-\nduce an MEV opportunity in a domain D to a player\nP \u2208 P if they can construct an ordered set of trans-\nactions B such that:\n\u2206b(P;st \u25cb B,st) \u2236= b(P,st \u25cb B) \u2212 b(P,st) > 0, (1)\nwhere b is the balance of P with the corresponding\norder. We call B a pro\ufb01table bundle or bundle. If\nB consists of a unique transaction, we say that B is\nan MEV-transaction. Each bundle can contain ex-\ntra metadata, such as sequencer timestamps, bundle\nhash, sender ID, and gas price. For a given state st,\neach bundle incurs execution costs called gas costs.\nFrom the bundle metadata and the domain state, the\nbundle execution incurs some payments, denoted by\n3\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "1d415c72-a6e1-4cc6-89b1-e62eb02afacb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d415c72-a6e1-4cc6-89b1-e62eb02afacb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "4", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Price of MEV: Towards a Game Theoretical Approach to MEV", "authors": "Bruno Mazorra, Michael Reynolds, Vanesa Daza", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13464v1", "release_date": "2022-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "pr(B), to a sequencer or set of sequencers responsible\nfor executing the bundle.\nDe\ufb01nition 2.6.

We say that a bundle B is a partial\nextraction of a bundle B\u2032 if B and B\u2032 compete, and\n\u2206b(P,st \u25cb B) < \u2206b(P \u2032,st \u25cb B\u2032).\nThe Flashbots combinatorial auction (FBCA) allows\nplayers to bid for bundles.\nThe Flashbots alloca-\ntion rule tries to solve the block optimization problem\nwith con\ufb02icting constraints. That is, the block can\nnot contain competing bundles (bundles that contain\nsame transactions or bundles that revert). So, the\nFBCA can be modelled as the knapsack problem with\na con\ufb02ict graph G = (V,E) [11], where V is the set\nof bundles, and uv \u2208 E if and only if bundles u and\nv compete.\nFlashbots use a greedy approximation\nalgorithm, leading to an auction mechanism similar\nto a \ufb01rst-price sealed auction, since players can only\nobserve winning bundles. That is, the bundles are\nordered by e\ufb00ective gas price (or average gas price,\nsee more details in the appendix A) and afterwards\nprune the con\ufb02icting bundles.\nIn case of symmet-\nric gas e\ufb03ciencies, the MEV opportunity is sealed to\nthe higher bidder and pays what they bid. In general,\nthis algorithm does not give the optimal solution (see\nappendix C). It also allows searchers to check for re-\nlayer deviation with just the executed block and the\nbundle sent by the searcher. In other words, theo-\nretically, searchers can privately monitor the correct\nfunctioning of the relayer.\nNow we are ready to de\ufb01ne the local MEV for a player\nP or MEVP for short. The de\ufb01nition we provide is\nsimilar to the one provided in [3]. However, in [3],\nplayers have constraints on the state transitions, but\nnot on the set of bundles that they can construct.\nDe\ufb01nition 2.8. Let D be a domain with state st, a\nplayer P with local mempool view T M\nP\nand a set of\ntransactions TP that the player P can construct. We\ndenote by CP = T M\nP\n\u222a TP to be the set of reachable\ntransactions.\nWe de\ufb01ne the local MEV of P with\nstate st (MEVP (st)) as the solution to the following\noptimization problem\nmax\nB\n\u2206b(P;st \u25cb B,st)\ns.t.\nB \u2286 CP ,\nst \u2192 st \u25cb B is a valid state transition in D\nLet argmevP (st) be the set of bundles that are a so-\nlution to the optimization problem2. The constraints\nof reachable bundles is subject to a player\u2019s informa-\ntion, gas e\ufb03ciency, budget, ability to propose blocks,\netc.\nObserve that if all players have access to the same\nMEV opportunities and have access to all bundles,\nthen this de\ufb01nition is equivalent to the one provided\nin [3]. If the mempool view is the empty set, we will\nrefer to the MEV as on top of block MEV, and we\nwill denote it by TMEVP .\nLemma 2.9. For a given player P and a state st, if\nB \u2208 argmevP (st), then MEVP (st \u25cb B) = 0.\nProof. Assume\notherwise.\nLet\nst\nand\nB\n\u2208\nargmevP (st) such that MEVP (st) > 0. Then, there\nexist B\u2032 such that \u2206b(P,st \u25cb B \u25cb B\u2032,st \u25cb B) > 0.\nTaking the bundle B\u2032\u2032 = B \u222a B\u2032, we have that\n\u2206(P,st \u25cb B\u2032\u2032,st) > MEVP (st), that is a contradic-\ntion.\nDe\ufb01nition 2.10. For a set of reachable bundles C,\nwe de\ufb01ne the C-permissionless MEV ( MEVC) as the\nminimum local MEV that can be extracted among\nplayers that have access to the bundles in C. More\nformally,\nMEVC(st) \u2236=\nmin\nP s.t C\u2286TP MEVP (st).\nIf for all players P\nwith reachable bundles C,\nMEVP (st) = 0, we say that st is a null MEV state.\nWe denote the set of null MEV states as NS.\nRemark: Note that this de\ufb01nition is an extension\nof the de\ufb01nition made in [16] when CK is the set\nof transactions that burns K coins. In other words,\nMEVCK permissionless is MEV that can be extracted\nby players with at least K coins. In this paper, we\nwill assume that a \ufb01nite number of players are able to\ncapture a speci\ufb01c MEV opportunity. In other words,\n2Observe that this de\ufb01nition fundamentally depends on the\ntoken balance. In the presence of a unique token, MEVP is\ntrivially de\ufb01ned.

We will model and for-\nmalize the MEV stage game. In other words, we will\nformalize the game played for extracting a given MEV\nopportunity in a speci\ufb01c block. Afterwards, we will\nde\ufb01ne the utility of the players as a function of their\nbalance and the notion of strategy. Finally, we intro-\nduce a solution concept of the MEV stage game, the\nSybil resistant Nash equilibrium.\nWe model the MEV game as a sequential game among\na set of n searchers P = {P1,...,Pn} who can send\nbundles to obtain an MEV opportunity. We will as-\nsume that all players compete for the same MEV\nopportunity and have su\ufb03cient capital to extract it.\nWhen a speci\ufb01c player wins the MEV opportunity, it\nreaches a null MEV state for all players. In the fol-\nlowing, we will provide a list of points that will de\ufb01ne\nthe MEV stage game. This game will take into ac-\ncount the latency of the players, the duration of the\nblocks, the mechanism of transaction inclusion, and\nthe costs of improving software, node location, etc.\n1. Continuous time: Searchers act in continuous\ntime rather than discrete rounds (as in typical\nextensive-form games). That is, at any moment\nin time, players can take an action that, in our\ncase study, will be sending a bundle.\n2. Local MEV: At time t, each player Pi \ufb01nds\nan MEV opportunity of value vi(t) \u223c Vi(t), (in\ngeneral, such that vi(t) \u2265 vi(s)) for all t \u2265 s, with\n{Vi(t) \u2236 t \u2265 0} being a family of distributions.\nMore speci\ufb01cally, for each time t, the player \ufb01nds\na bundle B such that \u2206b(st \u25cb B,st) = vi(t).\n3. Latency: Searchers can see each other\u2019s actions,\nbut not immediately, due to the latency in the\npeer-to-peer network.\nThe latency is modeled\nby a directed weighted graph G = (E,V ). Each\nsearcher controls a set of nodes Ni \u2286 V . So, if\nPj sends a bundle from a subset of peers Lj \u2286\nNj at time tj, Pi observe the bundle at time\nt = tj + d(Lj,Ni), where d is the non-symmetric\ndistance induced by the weight.\n4. Probabilistic auction duration: The auction\nterminates at a randomly drawn time when a\nnew block is mined. We model the block interval\nas a positive random variable B.\n5. Competitors information:\nPlayers do not\nnecessarily know the number of competitors and\ntheir features. However, each player estimates\nthe number of competitors and their behavior.\n6. Access to a public correlating device: Let\n(\u2126,Pr) be a probability space. All searchers ob-\nserve the \ufb01rst drawn w \u2208 [0,1] of a uniform pub-\nlic random variable X (a beacon or the hash of\nthe previous block). This can be used by players\nto coordinate their actions.\n7. Auction Mechanism: Sequencers have a pre-\nde\ufb01ned algorithm that inputs a set of bundles\nand outputs an order of transactions for inclusion\nin a block. We will denote this algorithm by the\nordering mechanism. This ordering mechanism\nand the characteristics of the MEV opportunity\n(Back-running, Front-running, sandwich,...) de-\ntermines the revenue for each player. The order-\ning mechanism and the MEV opportunity deter-\nminate an auction A = (x,pr), that is, a pair\nof maps that take as inputs the set of bundles\nand a random event and outputs a winner and\nthe payment induced per each player.

External costs:\nPlayers can improve their\nmempool view, reduce their latency, and improve\ntheir software to increase their local MEV. The\nset of external actions that a player Pi can take\nrely on a set of actions Ai, and the costs of\ntaking those actions are modeled by a function\nci \u2236 Ai \u2192 R.\nDe\ufb01nition 3.1. Given a set of players P, a random\npositive variable B, a gossip network graph G and\nan auction mechanism, A = (x,pr), an MEV game is\nG = (P,G,B,A,(ci)i=1,..,n). We say the game is sym-\nmetric if all players share the same features. That is,\nVi = Vj, ci = cj for all i,j, A are symmetric functions\nand G is a homogeneous graph.\nThe MEV game has a structure of sequential con-\ntinuous game, and therefore we can de\ufb01ne utilities,\nstrategies, and solution concepts such as Nash equi-\nlibrium.\n5\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "318ec3bc-1418-4f81-9600-6de6c78cc156": {"__data__": {"id_": "318ec3bc-1418-4f81-9600-6de6c78cc156", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "6", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Price of MEV: Towards a Game Theoretical Approach to MEV", "authors": "Bruno Mazorra, Michael Reynolds, Vanesa Daza", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13464v1", "release_date": "2022-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "De\ufb01nition 3.2. A strategy Si is a procedure for\nparticipating in the MEV stage game and may be\nprobabilistic. Si takes the following form, for a cur-\nrent time t and a local view viewi(t) of the player i:\n(a,view\u2032\ni(t)) \u2190 Si(t,viewi(t)). The output a is the\naction taken by Pi and is bounded by domain con-\nstraints. The output view\u2032\ni(t) is the updated state,\nthat is, view\u2032\ni(t) = viewi(t) \u222a {a}.\nA strategy of\na player i is non-adaptive if it does not depend on\nthe local view viewi(t). More formally, for every t\nand every pair viewi(t),view\u2032\ni(t) \u2208 Viewi(t), it holds\nSi(t,viewi(t)) = Si(t,view\u2032\ni(t)).\nDe\ufb01nition 3.3. Let S = (S1,...,Sn) be a strategy\ntuple, then the expected payo\ufb00 of the player Pi is\nui(Si,S\u2212i) \u2236= E[\u2206bi \u2223 S],\nwhere S\u2212i is an n\u22121 tuple without the ith coordinate.\nWe denote by Si the set of all strategies.\nThat is, ui(Si,S\u2212i) is the expected payo\ufb00 of player i\nif they execute the strategy Si, the other players exe-\ncute the strategy S\u2212i in a domain D. Notice that we\nassume players have a monotone risk-neutral utility\nover the balances.\nDe\ufb01nition 3.4. Let G be an MEV stage game, we\nsay that a tuple of strategies (S1,...,Sn) is a Nash\nequilibrium (NE) if for each player Pi\nui(Si,S\u2212i) \u2265 ui( \u02dcSi,S\u2212i), for all strategies \u02dcSi.\nIn other words, if players are taking the strategies\n(S1,...,Sn), none of them have incentives to deviate\nunilaterally. We denote NE(G) the set of all Nash\nequilibrium.\nHowever, the notion of Nash equilibrium is not strong\nin permissionless environments.\nFor example, the\nequilibrium of \ufb01rms competing in the Cournot price\nmodel [14] is weak against Sybil attacks. Another ex-\nample is the equilibrium constructed in the theorem\nof Flashboys 2.0 [5] that proves that exponential raise\nbidding strategies with grim-trigger area a Nash equi-\nlibrium in the game with two players. Nevertheless,\none can prove that agents have incentives to use Sybil\nattacks to maximize their payo\ufb00. For this reason, we\nintroduce a stronger notion of a solution concept for\nMEV games that are resistant to Sybil attacks:\nDe\ufb01nition 3.5. Let G be a symmetric3 MEV game\nwith n players, and let \u03c6 \u2236 N \u2192 \u2295\u221e\ni=1 Si be a strategy\nmapping.\nA Sybil resistant Nash equilibrium is \u03c6\nsuch that for all n \u2208 N, \u03c6(n) \u2208 \u2295n\ni=1 Si, and \u03c6(n) is\n3This de\ufb01nition can be extended to non-symmetric games,\nbut we will leave it for future work.\na Nash equilibrium, where for each i \u2208 {1,...,n} and\nj \u2208 {1,...,n + 1} \u2212 {i},\nui(\u03c6(n)i,\u03c6(n)\u2212i) \u2265 ui(\u03c6(n + 1)i,\u03c6(n + 1)\u2212i)\n+ uj(\u03c6(n + 1)j,\u03c6(n + 1)\u2212j).\nThe notion of Sybil resistance is important in per-\nmissionless pseudo-anonymous environments such as\nblockchains. Players have the ability to generate ad-\nditional addresses to take more pro\ufb01ts from cooper-\native strategies. In future work, we will prove that\nSybil resistant cooperative Nash equilibrium exist in\nthe priority gas auction in the non-repeated games,\nand the existence of Sybil resistant equilibrium in\ngames with private mempools.\n4\nPrice of MEV\nMEV games have an important impact on users,\nnetwork\ncongestion,\ncomputation\noverload,\nand\nblockchain liveness. On one hand, some MEV oppor-\ntunities arise from value extracted from users. On\nthe other hand, in general, MEV games induce an\nine\ufb03cient extraction of MEV opportunities, leading\nto network congestion (e.g. P2P network load), and\nchain congestion (e.g.\nblock-space usage).\nIn this\npaper, we will not take into account the negative\nexternalities of MEV on individual users (for exam-\nple, sandwich attacks and oracle manipulation), but\nrather the negative externalities that impact the con-\nsensus protocol, liveness, chain quality, stake distri-\nbution, etc. Suppose there is an MEV opportunity\non a state st, with a set of n players that compete\nto extract it, sending bundles B1,...,Bk. Then, a se-\nquencer, using the ordering mechanism or, outputs\na block (this order mechanism does not necessarily\nrespect the internal order of the bundles).\nIn this\nsetting, we de\ufb01ne the block space cost as the gas cost\nof executing the block built by the ordering mecha-\nnism using the bundles, more formally\nC(B1,...,Bk;st) = gasUsed(st \u25cb or(\u222ak\ni=1Bi)).\n(3)\nWe naturally extend the function of cost over strate-\ngies by taking the outcome (or the expected outcomes\nin case of mixed strategies) of the strategies (the\nbroadcasted bundles). Clearly, ex-post it is trivial to\ncompute the gas cost. However, ex-ante, estimating\nthe gas costs induced by the MEV game is much more\ncomplex due to the non-commutative nature of exe-\ncution costs. Also, other cost functions can be very\nrelevant in some domains. Di\ufb00erent MEV games can\ninduce other types of negative externalities, such as\n6\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "2c9232b3-84a2-4cbd-9f43-cb2c8d5722f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c9232b3-84a2-4cbd-9f43-cb2c8d5722f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 10, "source": "7", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Price of MEV: Towards a Game Theoretical Approach to MEV", "authors": "Bruno Mazorra, Michael Reynolds, Vanesa Daza", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13464v1", "release_date": "2022-08-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "wasted resources induced by computation costs4 or\ncentralization e\ufb00ects.\nIn general, self-interested behaviour by strategic play-\ners leads to an ine\ufb03cient result, an outcome that\ncould be improved upon given centralized control over\neveryone\u2019s action [12]. Nevertheless, imposing such\ncontrol can be costly, infeasible or undesirable (due\nto trust assumptions).\nThis motivates the search\nfor conditions and mechanisms in which decentral-\nized optimization by strategic agents is guaranteed\nto produce a near-optimal outcome. The price of an-\narchy (PoA) [13] is a measure that quanti\ufb01es how far\nis the worst Nash equilibrium (in the sense of social\ncost) with respect to any optimal con\ufb01guration that\nminimizes the social cost. More formally, given a cost\nfunction C and the set of Nash equilibrium NE, the\nprice of anarchy is de\ufb01ned as:\nPoA = maxS\u2208NE C(S)\nminS C(S)\n.\nDi\ufb00erent examples of the study of the price of anar-\nchy can be seen in [4, 12, 13]. However, the price of\nanarchy in the MEV game is, in general, not well-\nde\ufb01ned. For example, assume that two players are\ncompeting for extracting the same arbitrage oppor-\ntunity.\nThen, as we will see, the block space cost\nof extracting the arbitrage opportunity will be the\nsum of gas used by executing both searchers\u2019 trans-\nactions. However, the minimal cost of the game is\nzero, since not extracting the MEV opportunity is a\nfeasible outcome. Therefore, the ratio is not de\ufb01ned,\nleaving an inconsistent de\ufb01nition of the price of anar-\nchy in the MEV game. In the following, we propose\na small adjustment to have a well-de\ufb01ned price of\nanarchy in the MEV game, which we denote as the\nPrice of MEV. This measure tracks the social costs\ninduced by the competition among individually ratio-\nnal agents for MEV extraction in a particular MEV\ngame. More precisely, the Price of MEV is a fam-\nily of measures parametrized by the social cost func-\ntions. This family of measurements can be useful to\ncompare the negative externalities and trade-o\ufb00s of\ndi\ufb00erent MEV games. Similar to the price of anarchy\nde\ufb01nition, the price of MEV of game G with social\ncost C is the ratio of the worst Nash equilibrium with\nrespect to the extraction made by the most e\ufb03cient\nplayer in an order-free consensus protocol blockchain.\nDe\ufb01nition 4.1. Given a cost function C, the set of\nSybil resistant Nash equilibrium SNE(G), and the set\n4For example, the energetic costs induced by computing\nTH/s in blockchains that order transactions by nonce.\nSee\nBSC-PR for more details.\nof actions that induce a null MEV state NS, we de\ufb01ne\nthe price of MEV as:\nPoMEV(G,n) = maxS\u2208SNE(G) C(S)\nminS\u2208NSC(S)\n,\nwhere mina\u2208NSC(a) is the minimum cost taken by\nextracting the MEV opportunity.\nWe argue that a more e\ufb03cient mechanism to extract\nMEV opportunities (low Price of MEV) can have an\nimportant impact on blockchain stability, users util-\nity, and consensus protocol5. In the case where the\ncost function is de\ufb01ned over pure strategies, we can\nextend the de\ufb01nition naturally over the mixed strate-\ngies, taking the expectancy of the outcomes.\n5\nConclusions\nand\nFuture\nWork\nIn this work, we proposed measures to formally study\nthe Nash equilibrium and negative externalities of dif-\nferent ordering mechanisms. We think that this is im-\nport due to the future changes on Ethereum mainnet\nabout Proposer-Builder separation and MEV-boost\n[7]. We leave for future work to study and compute\nthe price of MEV of popular proposed ordering mech-\nanisms. Also, in the future we will study the negative\nexternalities of zero-sum MEV opportunities such as\nsandwich attacks, time bandit attacks, eclipse at-\ntacks, draining bot attacks6, and censorship attacks.\nWe conjecture that a domain with suboptimal block-\nspace market design will lead to more block-space\nmisuse (high price of MEV), raising the transactions\nfees of the underlying domain. The higher transac-\ntions fees will increase the direct payments of the\nminer (another form of MEV) and the market ine\ufb03-\nciencies. This market ine\ufb03cient will imply ine\ufb03cient\nprice discover, creating more internal and cross chain\nMEV opportunities. We call this e\ufb00ect the Circular\nforces of MEV 1.\nReferences\n[1]\nYal\u00b8c\u0131n Ak\u00b8cay, Haijun Li, and Susan H Xu.\n\u201cGreedy algorithm for the general multidimen-\nsional knapsack problem\u201d.

Rollups\u2019 cost consists of two parts: data posting\nand delay. In the new proposal, the data posting cost corresponds to a blob posting\ncost and is \ufb01xed in each block, no matter how much of the blob is utilized by the rollup.\nThe tradeo\ufb00 is clear: the rollup prefers to post a full blob, but if its transaction arrival\nrate is low, \ufb01lling up a blob space causes too large delay cost. The \ufb01rst result of the\npaper shows that if a rollup transaction arrival rate is too low, it prefers to use the\nregular blockspace market for data posting, as it o\ufb00ers a more \ufb02exible cost structure.\nSecond, we show that shared blob posting is not always bene\ufb01cial for participating\nrollups and change in the aggregate blob posting cost in the equilibrium depends on\nthe types of participating rollups. In the end, we discuss blob cost-sharing rules from\nan axiomatic angle.\n1\nIntroduction\nEthereum improvement proposal (EIP) numbered 4844, dubbed as EIP-4844, is meant to\ncreate a cheaper and more e\ufb03cient calldata posting service on the Ethereum main chain,\nsometimes called layer one (L1). The goal is to facilitate the Ethereum ecosystem move to\nrollups. Today, the largest optimistic and ZK rollups o\ufb00er fees that are 3-50x lower than\nEthereum L1. This EIP and follow-ups will further reduce costs of transacting on rollups\nby providing extra space, thus creating strong incentives for users to switch to using rollups\nand enabling new applications that can borrow Ethereum L1 security at a much lower cost.\nIn this project, we study the economics of the proposal. We refer to the market created\nby EIP-4844 as the data market and the gas market of the Ethereum mainnet as the main\nmarket. In particular, we look at the trade-o\ufb00s faced by rollups that are adopting the new\nservice:\n(1) When should a rollup use the data market versus the main market for sending data\nto L1?\n(2) Is there a substantial e\ufb03ciency gain in aggregating data from multiple rollups and\nwhat happens to the data market fees?\n(3) When would rollups decide to aggregate and what is the optimal cost-sharing scheme?\n1\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "78d36144-db9d-4013-965b-6e4406e5db30": {"__data__": {"id_": "78d36144-db9d-4013-965b-6e4406e5db30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 13, "source": "2", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "EIP-4844 Economics and Rollup Strategies", "authors": "Davide Crapis, Edward W.

We make simplifying assumptions that allow us to obtain a\ncrisp characterization of optimal rollup data posting strategies. In particular, we consider a\ncontinuous-time model in a large market with many rollups.\nWe model the cost of rollups as a sum of two parts. The \ufb01rst part of the cost is observable,\nit is a data posting cost. The second is delay cost. For some applications delay of L1 \ufb01nality\nis not crucial.\nHowever, many applications built on top of rollups need fast L1 \ufb01nality\nfor their liveness and some even include it in their security model. The goal of the rollup\nis to minimize overall costs per transaction, as the per-transaction costs are what users\nincur when using rollups.\nThe blob posting cost is calculated in the equilibrium state\nendogenously. The main market price per gas is assumed to be \ufb01xed for simplicity. The\nrollups decide between using either of the two technologies for transaction-relevant data\nposting, that is, both markets are perfect substitutes for each other 1. We show that if\nthe demand for blob posting is high, it drives smaller rollups to use the main market data\nposting strategy. We identify conditions when posting data on the main market is better for\nthe rollup than posting blobs. In the second part of the paper, the joint blob posting option\nfor two (or more) rollups is studied. Depending on the type of rollups that decide to post\na shared blob, the price of the blob in the equilibrium can change in both directions, up or\ndown. We derive bounds on the increase or decrease of the blob price in relative terms. If\nthe shared blob posting is pro\ufb01table, the rollups can join in doing so. We study cost-sharing\nrules from the axiomatic angle, by employing the Nash bargaining solution concept from the\neconomic theory. In particular, we show that if both rollups were using data market, in the\njoint blob posting large rollup has to pay less than a proportional cost of the joint blob. On\nthe other hand, it always pays more than half of the joint blob cost and the improvement\nof the large rollup is always less than the improvement of the small rollup.\n1.1\nRelated Literature\nIn [5], the authors study how under the EIP-1559 dynamic fee mechanism the gas usage\nconverges to the target usage over time. This theoretical and empirical observation is a\ncornerstone of our modeling of the equilibrium state. [4] proposes a dynamic posted-price\nmechanism\u2014which uses not only block utilization but also observable bids from past blocks\nto compute a posted price for subsequent blocks, they study the stability and welfare op-\ntimality of the proposed policy in a steady state. In [3], the authors argue that di\ufb00erent\nresource types should be independently priced, as converting all resources in one unit and\npricing it uniformly is economically ine\ufb03cient. EIP-4844 can be seen as the \ufb01rst step to-\nwards \ufb01xing the economic ine\ufb03ciencies of pricing di\ufb00erent types of resources together. [1]\nprovides a de\ufb01nition and empirical analysis of the upcoming EIP-4844 fee market, which\nintroduces data gas on the Ethereum blockchain and a data gas pricing mechanism modeled\nafter the fee update mechanism of EIP-1559. [2] studies optimal dynamic pricing method for\nmultiple resources, with uncertain future demand \ufb02ow and statistical dependencies between\nresource demands. In [6] the authors provide a rollup data batch posting strategy, in the\ncontext of a single independent rollup, and in the absence of a dedicated market for data.\nThey analyze trade-o\ufb00s between price and time that are similar in nature to the ones faced\nhere in the presence of a dual market and multiple rollups.\n1Using both markets interchangeably is technologically feasible.\n2\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "a105fa81-c0b3-4c48-a128-963df8e90878": {"__data__": {"id_": "a105fa81-c0b3-4c48-a128-963df8e90878", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 13, "source": "3", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "EIP-4844 Economics and Rollup Strategies", "authors": "Davide Crapis, Edward W.

We make the following list of assumptions:\n\u2022 Delay cost of a transaction is aD, where D is the delay, in time units, experienced by\nthe transaction (a time when a transaction was posted in a batch or blob to L1, minus\ntime when it arrived to L2 sequencer), and a > 0 is a positive constant.\n\u2022 L1 gas price is G, which is treated as a constant.\n\u2022 The base cost of a batch- or blob-posting transaction on L1 is P0G. Here P0 indicates\nthe size of the metadata associated with the rollup transaction containing a batch/blob.\n\u2022 The cost of posting a blob on L1 is P0G + B, where B will be set later to a market-\nclearing price. The latter is interpreted as the minimum price for which no more than\nthree blobs are posted per time unit on average.\n\u2022 The cost of posting a batch of n transactions on L1 is (P0 + P1n)G.\nThe target number of blobs per Ethereum block is denoted by k 2. We treat time as\ncontinuous so that a blob can be posted at any time. Conceptually, a \u201ctime unit\u201d can be\nthought of as one L1 block time, but in this model, we will allow blobs to be posted \u201cin\nbetween\u201d L1 blocks. Suppose there are rollups with transaction arrival rates R1, R2, ..., Rn\nand they are sorted in decreasing rates, Ri \u2265 Ri+1 for any i \u2208 {1, ..., n \u2212 1}. The goal of a\nrollup is to minimize cost per transaction. The latter is obtained by dividing the total cost\nby the total number of transactions in the blob and paid by rollup users. The justi\ufb01cation of\nthis approach is that even though some transactions arrive earlier than others, their arrival\ntime can be assumed to be uniformly random. This payment rule corresponds to the average\ncosts, and therefore, the users pay fairly.\n3\nAnalysis\nIn this section, we obtain results on the tradeo\ufb00 between using data and main markets.\nFirst, we show the following:\nProposition 1. There is a threshold n\u2217, such that for any i > n\u2217, a rollup i uses the direct\non L1 posting strategy.\nProof. Let us determine the optimal strategy for a single rollup, assuming the prices on\nboth the data market and on L1 are \ufb01xed. There are two strategies any rollup could use:\n(1) posting blobs or (2) posting directly on L1. The rollup \ufb01nds a strategy that minimizes\nthe cost within each of these strategies separately and then selects the strategy that has a\nlower cost.\nFirst, consider a blob-posting strategy. Suppose a rollup with generic rate R posts a\nblob every time t. Then, a blob contains Rt transactions, with the total cost (posting cost\nplus delay cost) of\nTB(t) := P0G + B + aRt2\n2\n.\n(1)\n2Initially set to 2 and currently set to 3.\n3\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "a4adc4f7-7daf-4b5a-bfbf-96f1cdc8b8fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4adc4f7-7daf-4b5a-bfbf-96f1cdc8b8fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 13, "source": "4", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "EIP-4844 Economics and Rollup Strategies", "authors": "Davide Crapis, Edward W.

However, it might be that some rollups under this price will not use a\nblob posting strategy, that is, it is an overestimation of the price. The second step \ufb01xes this\npotential overestimation by \ufb01rst excluding all small rollups and adding them one by one.\nExample 1.

The second inequality, BN \u2265 BN/2, is equivalent to\n\u221a\n2\u221aR1 + R2 \u2265 \u221aR1 + \u221aR2.\nThe latter is equivalent to (R1 \u2212 R2)2 \u2265 0, which holds\ntrivially.\nFrom the proof above we see that the equality in BN = B/2 holds if and only if there\nare only two rollups and their transaction rates are equal. For obtaining the corner solution,\nit is also implicitly assumed that no other rollup joins the blob posting strategy, in the new\nstate with a lower price.\nCase 2:\nIn this case, one rollup posts blobs, and the other posts on the main market in the\ninitial arrangement. Joining blob posting pushes the price of the blob posting up, assuming\nthat no rollup stops using blob posting technology. In the following, we derive an upper\nbound on the price increase.\nProposition 3. BN satis\ufb01es the following inequalities: 2B \u2265 BN \u2265 B.\nProof. Assume that the rollup that posts blobs is indexed i, that is, its transaction rate is\nRi and the rollup that posts calldata at the main market has a transaction rate R. Then,\nthe old blob price in the equilibrium is equal to B = c(\u221aRi + t)2, where c =\n1\n2k2 and\nt = P\nk\u0338=i\n\u221aRk. The new price, on the other hand, is equal to BN = c(\u221aRi + R + t)2. It\nis obvious that BN \u2265 B, since no rollup stops using blob posting strategy. 2B \u2265 BN is\nequivalent to\n\u221a\n2(\u221aRi + t) \u2265 \u221aRi + R + t. It is su\ufb03cient to show that\n\u221a\n2\u221aRi \u2265 \u221aRi + R,\nequivalent to Ri \u2265 R. The latter holds because the rollup with transaction rate Ri posts\nblobs in the equilibrium and has a higher transaction rate than the rollup with R rate,\nposting on the main market.\nCase 3:\nIn this case, both rollups use the main market for posting the data in the initial\nsetting. Assume they join in posting blobs and no rollup stops using blob posting technology.\nThen, the new blob price BN in the equilibrium increases. We obtain the following upper\nbound on the increase.\n6\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "2c289f18-a628-41bf-bf1d-877e4904336c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c289f18-a628-41bf-bf1d-877e4904336c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 13, "source": "7", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "EIP-4844 Economics and Rollup Strategies", "authors": "Davide Crapis, Edward W.

BN satis\ufb01es the following inequalities: 2B \u2265 BN \u2265 B.\nProof. The proof is similar to the proof of proposition 3. Two rollups with transaction rates\nR1 and R2 that were posting their data in the main market, can reach a level that is almost\n2R1. In fact, as long as R1 + R2 \u2265 R1, the rollup with rate R1 would not post blobs in the\nnew equilibrium, a contradiction with the assumption. This gives an upper bound of 2B on\nthe new equilibrium price.\n4.1\nCost Sharing\nSuppose there are two chains, with transaction arrival rates RL = R, from now on referred\nto as large rollup, and RS = Rf, referred to as small rollup. 0 < f < 1 is a real number.\nAssume P0 = 0, that is, there are no metadata costs. We use the same model as above. Let\nT rL and T rS denote costs per transaction of large and small rollups, respectively, CL and\nCS denote the total number of transactions posted by large and small rollups separately.\nIn the following, for the illustration of calculating these parameters above, in this and the\nnext subsections, we assume that both rollups use a blob posting strategy. If the big chain\nis the only one using the blob space and it posts every tL time, then optimal posting time\nis tL =\np\n2B/(aR), with a cost per transaction of T rL =\np\n2Ba/R and the total number of\ntransactions in blob CL =\np\n2BR/a.\nFor the small chain only, we have optimal posting time tS =\np\n2B/(aRf), with a cost\nper transaction of T rS =\np\n2Ba/(Rf) and the total number of transaction in the blob is\nCS =\np\n2BRf/a.\nIf the two chains post their blobs separately, the small chain has a higher per transaction\ncost, by a factor of 1/\u221af per transaction, since tS/tR = 1/\u221af. Because the large chain has\nmore transactions, it pays more overall, by a factor of 1/\u221af.\nA joint blob is also posted so that it minimizes cost per transaction. This is a Pareto\ne\ufb03cient approach, as otherwise, both rollups could agree to deviate to the optimal strategy\nand share added value in any way. Based on the analysis in the proof of proposition, a joint\nblob is posted every tJ =\nq\n2BN\n(1+f)aR. The total cost per blob is:\nBN + a(1 + f)R\n2\n\u00b7\n2BN\n(1 + f)aR = 2BN.\nIn all three cases, the total cost per blob is equal to 2 times the blob price. A cost per\ntransaction of T rJ =\np\n2BNa/(R(1 + f)) and the total number of transaction in the blob\nis CJ =\np\n2BNR(1 + f)/a.\nFirst, note that if T rJ > T rL, the rollups will not join in posting blobs together, as it is\nnot pro\ufb01table for a large rollup. Therefore, an interesting case is when T rJ < T rL \u2264 T rS.\nIn propositions 2, 3 and 4, we obtained that 2B \u2265 BN \u2265 B/2. That is, the relation between\nT rJ and T rL can be arbitrary. We discuss a suitable cost-sharing rule in the next section.\n4.2\nThe Nash Bargaining Solution\nIn this section, we take an axiomatic approach to the cost-sharing rule between rollups that\ndecide to post blobs together. One such approach is suggested by the Nash Bargaining\nsolution. First, we introduce the required notation and then reduce the cost-sharing rule\nto solving the Nash Bargaining problem.

The utility (payo\ufb00) function\nof agent i is given by ui : A \u2192 R. We consider linear utility functions, in particular. Let S\ndenote the set of all possible utilities (payo\ufb00s):\nS = {(s1, s2) | s1 = u1(a), s2 = u2(a), a \u2208 A} .\nLet s := (s1, s2). Further, let d = (d1, d2) = (u1 (D) , u2 (D)) be the utility vector if no\nagreement could be reached (threat point).

In our case, this means that rollups pay completely for the blob posting\ncost and do not overpay. Now, we are in the position to de\ufb01ne a Nash Bargaining Solution.\nDe\ufb01nition 1. A bargaining solution is a rule that assigns a solution vector f(S, d) \u2208 S\nto every bargaining problem B = (S, d).\nLet fi(S, d) denote the i-component of f(S, d). That is: f(S, d) = (f1 (S, d) , f2 (S, d)) .\nWe have the following 4 axioms.\nAxiom 1 (Invariance of Utility Scaling). If there are two bargaining situations B =\n(S, d) and \u00afB = ( \u00afS, \u00afd) with \u00afS = {\u03b11s1 + \u03b21, \u03b12s2 + \u03b22 : s \u2208 S} and \u00afdi = \u03b1idi + \u03b2i \u2200i, where\n\u03b11, \u03b12 > 0. Then, for the solution, the following holds: fi( \u00afS, \u00afd) = \u03b1ifi(S, d) + \u03b2i \u2200i.\nThe axiom states that if we change the way we measure utility when we construct a\nbargaining problem but keep new utility scales decision-theoretically equivalent to the old\nones, then the bargaining solution in utility-allocation space changes in the same way, so\nthat it still corresponds to the same real outcome.\nAxiom 2 (Pareto Optimality). If f(S, d) is a solution to B = (S, d), then f(S, d) \u2208 H(S).\nThe axiom states that there is no other feasible allocation that is better than the solution\nfor one player and not worse than the solution for the other player. For the next axiom, we\nneed a de\ufb01nition:\nDe\ufb01nition 2. A game is called symmetric if two conditions hold: (1) d1 = d2, and (2)\n(s1, s2) \u2208 S, then (s2, s1) \u2208 S.\nAxiom 3 (Symmetry). If (S, d) is symmetric, then the solution is also symmetric, i.e.\nf1(S, d) = f2(S, d).\nThe axiom states that, if the positions of players 1 and 2 are completely symmetric in\nthe bargaining problem, then the solution also treats them symmetrically.\nAxiom 4 (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives). Let (S, d) and (T, d) be two\nbargaining situations with S \u2282 T and f(T, d) \u2208 S, then f(T, d) = f(S, d).\nThe axiom states that eliminating feasible alternatives (other than the threat point) that\nwould not have been chosen does not a\ufb00ect the result.\n8\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "a4726506-c73d-44ae-8cd9-b6268b72c685": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4726506-c73d-44ae-8cd9-b6268b72c685", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 13, "source": "9", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "EIP-4844 Economics and Rollup Strategies", "authors": "Davide Crapis, Edward W.

Suppose the large rollup is\nindexed by 1 and the small rollup is indexed by 2. The disagreement point in our setting is\n(d1, d2) = (T rL, T rS). Assuming that posting a joint blob is pro\ufb01table, that is, T rJ < T rL,\nthe rollups need to decide how to share the new blob price BN. Suppose the large rollup\npays B1 and the small rollup pays B2, with B1, B2 \u2265 0.\nThen, we can rede\ufb01ne their\nper-transaction costs, which de\ufb01ne points (s1, s2) in the payo\ufb00 set.\nThis de\ufb01nes a two-\ndimensional space. However, note that because of the Pareto e\ufb03ciency, B1 + B2 = B holds,\nsince underpaying is not an option, and overpaying is not e\ufb03cient. Therefore, we are down\nto 1 dimensional space, as B1 \u2208 [0, BN] de\ufb01nes it fully.\nThe number of large and small rollup transactions in the blob are denoted by CJ,L\nand CJ,S, respectively. Since their rate ratio is 1\nf , we have CJ,L =\nCJ\n1+f and CJ,S = CJf\n1+f ,\nso that they sum up to CS. Let dJ,L and dJ,S denote the total delay costs of the large\nand small rollups, respectively. Then dJ,L = aRt2\nJ\n2\nand dJ,S = aRft2\nJ\n2\n.

Note that it is only a function of f, and therefore, the\ncontract between the rollups can be easily automatized. The axiomatic approach of this\nsection can be easily generalized to m > 2 rollups, by taking a Nash product over m rollups\n(s1 \u2212 d1)(s2 \u2212 d2) \u00b7 ... \u00b7 (sm \u2212 dm).

The last rollup contribution is determined\nby the contributions of the rest.\nFirst, we show a structural result that will come in handy later.

Since we consider only Pareto-e\ufb03cient solutions, the result, in particular, implies that\na Nash bargaining solution favors the small rollup compared to the \u201dfair\u201d blob cost-sharing\nrule, which improves both rollup per-transaction costs equally. The latter favors the large\nrollup to a high extent: the rollups pay almost equally even if f = 0.25.\nIn this section, we assumed that the two rollups engaged in the joint blob posting were\nthe ones that initially were posting blobs. This in particular gives a lower bound on the\nnew equilibrium price, derived in the Lemma 1, and is used in the proofs of propositions 5\nand 6. If one or both rollups were using the main market, then the propositions would be\nautomatically satis\ufb01ed, as the new equilibrium price goes up.\n5\nExtensions\nIn this section, we discuss two natural extensions of the baseline model. In the \ufb01rst extension,\nthe blob size is limited. Suppose there is the maximum blob size U, so that for any rollup,\nRt \u2264 U, or equivalently, the posting time t is upper bounded by U/R. Intuitively, adding an\nupper bound on the blob size causes the blob price in the equilibrium to increase, compared\nto the baseline model. The reason is that with the upper bound the rollups produce blobs\neven faster. To \ufb01gure out rollup optimum posting time in the case of using the data market,\nwe again solve the optimal time of posting using the \ufb01rst-order condition and compare the\nblob size with the upper bound U. If the obtained size is larger than the upper bound,\nthen we take the size to be U and adjust the posting time accordingly. If on the other\nhand, the optimal size is smaller than the upper bound, the rollup keeps the same optimal\nstrategy. Calculating the main market posting time is done exactly as in the main model,\ntherefore, deciding on the posting strategy given equilibrium price is trivial. Calculating the\nequilibrium price is also easy.\nShared blob posting stays the same if the aggregate demand does not cross the threshold,\nand cost-sharing does not need modi\ufb01cation as well.\nIf one of the participating rollups\nreaches the threshold size itself and the other one does not, then it has more bargaining\npower, as it saves only on the delay cost.\nHowever, if both rollups reach the threshold\nthemselves, cost-sharing becomes more intricate. Both rollups save only on the delay cost,\nand therefore, large rollup has lower bargaining power over a small rollup, compared to the\nbaseline model.\nIn the second extension, rollups have compression technology. It is natural to assume\nthat compression technology is monotonic, that is, the compression factor is increasing\nin the data size. Then, the existence of compression, in general, favors bigger rollups as\nwell, since they generate enough transaction data to compress e\ufb03ciently faster than smaller\nrollups do. In the case of shared blob posting, this advantage should be compensated. The\nNash bargaining outcome guarantees such compensation since the per-transaction cost in\n12\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "d7a54c72-60da-4624-b4e4-d1f40034434f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7a54c72-60da-4624-b4e4-d1f40034434f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 13, "source": "13", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "EIP-4844 Economics and Rollup Strategies", "authors": "Davide Crapis, Edward W.

Engineers and biologists facing similar optimization problems would be likely to re-\nstrict themselves to \ufb01nite action sets, but many economists prefer continuous action sets in\norder to be able to write \ufb01rst order conditions of optimality in differential forms, in hope\nof resolving them with explicit solutions. Furthermore, they have no qualms about using\nmodels with a continuum of agents. They explain that this guarantees an environment with\nperfect competition and tractable equilibrium behavior. However, these formulations often\nraise eyebrows from colleagues, and especially mathematicians. Our discussion of macro-\neconomic models is motivated in part by the desire to reconcile the approach to competitive\nequilibria with a continuum of players with the paradigm of mean \ufb01eld games. Addition-\nally, while not all economists like to work with continuous time, it has been argued over\nthe last two decades that models in macro-economic, contract theory, \ufb01nance, . . ., greatly\nbene\ufb01t from the switch to continuous time from the more traditional discrete time models.\nYuli Sannikov is certainly one of the most visible crusaders in this respect, and we shall\nfollow his lead and consider only continuous time models in this review chapter.\nLike it is often the case in the published literature in economics, economies are mod-\neled as populations with a continuum of players, and to capture the fact that the in\ufb02uence\nof any individual member on the aggregate should be in\ufb01nitesimally small, these individ-\nuals are modeled as elements of a measure space with a continuous measure, say the unit\ninterval [0, 1] with its Lebesgue\u2019s measure. This starting point is different from the typical\nset-up of mean \ufb01eld games which usually starts from N player games with N \ufb01nite, and\nconsiders the limit N \u2192 \u221e. We shall use both modeling paradigms, and refere the reader\nto [21, Section 3.7] for a discussion of the links between the two.\nNone of the macro-economic papers which we review in this chapter mention the name\nNash, or use the terminology Nash equilibrium. The authors of these papers are concerned\nwith general equilibria, not Nash equilibria. They \ufb01rst assume that all the aggregate quan-\ntities in the economy are given, and they let the participants in the economy optimize their\nutilities independently of each other. Next, they identify the constraints to be satis\ufb01ed\naccording to economic theory, compile them in a set which they call set of clearing con-\nditions, and check that the results of the participants\u2019 optimizations are compatible with\nthe clearing conditions. As long as the clearing conditions are satis\ufb01ed while the partici-\npants in the economy optimize their expected utilities, a general equilibrium is said to take\nplace. This procedure is very similar to the search for a Nash equilibrium. Identifying the\nbest response function amounts to having the participants optimize their expected utilities\ngiven the strategies of the other players, and given the constraints of economic theory, the\nsearch for a \ufb01xed point of the best response function appears as an analog of the check\nthat the clearing conditions are satis\ufb01ed. The parallel is even more striking when the clear-\ning conditions can be written in terms of aggregate quantities. Indeed these aggregates\nquantify the interactions between the economy participants, and since these aggregates are\nmost often nothing more than empirical means of state variables, they spell out mean \ufb01eld\ninteractions in the model. It is thus reasonable to cast these general equilibria as Nash\nequilibria for Mean Field Game models, and take full advantage of the technology already\ndeveloped for the analysis of these game models to gain a better understanding of these\ngeneral equilibria.\nAcknowledgements:\nI would like to thank Markus Brunnermeier for relentless attempts\nat educating me on some of the subtleties of the economic models discussed in Section 5.\nAlso, I would like to acknowledge the useful comments and suggestions from an anony-\nmous referee.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "dad9fb7b-4eff-4a3a-9aa6-29ba8ea21337": {"__data__": {"id_": "dad9fb7b-4eff-4a3a-9aa6-29ba8ea21337", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "3", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING & ECONOMICS\n3\n2. Financial Engineering Applications\n2.1. Systemic Risk. The study of systemic risk is concerned with the identi\ufb01cation\nand analysis of events or a sequences of events which could trigger severe instability, or\neven collapse of the \ufb01nancial system and the entire economy as a result. In \ufb01nance, sys-\ntemic risk is approached differently than the risk associated with any one individual insti-\ntution or portfolio. In the US, it was \ufb01rst brought to the forefront by the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York after the September 11, 2001 attack. See [62]. The Central Bank\nspearheaded several collaborative research initiatives involving economists and academic\nresearchers including engineers working on the safety of the electric grid, mathematicians\nexperts in graph theory and network analysis, population biologists, .... . But unfortunately,\nwhat brought this line of research in the limelight is the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008 for which\nsystemic risk was a major contributor. While the mean \ufb01eld game models we discuss below\ngive identical importance to the various institutions involved in the model, it is clear that a\nrealistic model of systemic risk in \ufb01nance should differentiate the roles of those companies\nconsidered to be too big to fail, and which have been identi\ufb01ed of\ufb01cially under the name\nof SIFI for Systemically Important Financial Institutions. They are the banks, insurance\ncompanies, or other \ufb01nancial institutions that U.S. federal regulators think would pose a\nserious risk to the economy if they were to collapse. See [47] for an account of the state\nof the art after the \ufb01nancial crisis. We shall brie\ufb02y discuss extensions of the models re-\nviewed below which could possibly account for the presence of such important players in\nthe models.\n2.1.1. A Toy Model of Systemic Risk. Our \ufb01rst example is borrowed from [26]. We\nview its main merit as being pedagogical. It gives us the opportunity to review some of\nthe main features of Linear Quadratic (LQ) \ufb01nite player game models, and in so doing,\nexplain how one can solve them. Moreover, despite its very simple structure, it exhibits\nseveral very useful characteristics: for each integer N \u2265 1, the N-player version of the\ngame has a unique closed loop equilibrium, a unique open loop equilibrium, this open loop\nequilibrium is in closed loop form, but it is different from the closed loop equilibrium.\nHowever, when N \u2192 \u221e, both equilibria converge toward the unique equilibrium of the\nmean \ufb01eld game.\nTo describe the model, let us assume that the log-monetary reserves of N banks, say\nXi\nt, i = 1, . . . , N, satisfy\ndXi\nt =\n\u0002\na(Xt \u2212 Xi\nt) + \u03b1i\nt\n\u0003\ndt + \u03c3\n\u0012p\n1 \u2212 \u03c12dW i\nt + \u03c1dW 0\nt\n\u0013\n,\ni = 1, . . . , N\nwhere W i\nt , i = 0, 1, . . . , N are independent Brownian motions and \u03c3 > 0 is a constant.\nThe notation \u00afXt stands for the empirical mean of the Xi\nt for i = 1, . . . , N, a is a constant\nregulating the mean reversion of Xi\nt toward the mean, and \u03c1 correlates the idiosyncratic\nshocks dW i\nt and the common shock dW 0\nt . So in this model, borrowing and lending is done\nthrough the drifts. In fact,\n\u2022 If Xi\nt is small (relative to the empirical mean Xt) then bank i wants to borrow\n(\u03b1i\nt > 0)\n\u2022 If Xi\nt is large then bank i will want to lend (\u03b1i\nt < 0)\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "2c806399-5f9a-4c80-befd-3b6eafebe1d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c806399-5f9a-4c80-befd-3b6eafebe1d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "4", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "4\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nThe adapted stochastic process \u03b1i = (\u03b1i\nt)t\u22650 is the control strategy of bank i which tries\nto minimize the quantity:\nJi(\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1N)\n= E\n(Z T\n0\n\u00141\n2(\u03b1i\nt)2 \u2212 q\u03b1i\nt(Xt \u2212 Xi\nt) + \u03f5\n2(Xt \u2212 Xi\nt)2\n\u0015\ndt + \u03f5\n2(XT \u2212 Xi\nT )2\n)\n(2.1)\nWe could imagine that the quantity q > 0 is chosen by the regulator to control the cost of\nborrowing and lending.\nThis model is a simple example of an N - player stochastic differential game with\nMean Field Interactions since the interactions are through the empirical means of the N\nstates, and a common noise.\nExplicit Solutions for Finite N. While it is usually very dif\ufb01cult to identify and com-\npute Nash equilibria for \ufb01nite player games, especially when the games are stochastic and\ndynamic, the very special Linear-Quadratic (LQ) nature of the model allows for explicit\nsolutions.\nSearching for an open loop Nash equilibrium \u03b1 = (\u03b1t)0\u2264t\u2264T for the game with\n\u03b1t = (\u03b11\nt , . . . , \u03b1N\nt ) being adapted to the \ufb01ltration generated by the Brownian motions can\nbe done using the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle.

This equation is uniquely solvable if we assume \u03f5 \u2265 q2,\nis the unique open loop Nash equilibrium. Notice that \u03b1t is in closed loop / feedback form\nsince it is of the form \u03b1t = \u03c6t(Xt) for the deterministic function\n(2.4)\n(t, x) 7\u2192 \u03c6i\nt(x) =\n\u0002\nq + (1 \u2212 1\nN )\u03b7t\n\u0003\n(x \u2212 xi),\nwith\n\u00afx = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nxi,\nfor i = 1, . . . , N. Note also that in equilibrium, the states of the banks satisfy:\n(2.5)\ndXi\nt =\n\u0002\na + q + (1 \u2212 1\nN )\u03b7t\n\u0003\u0000Xt \u2212 Xi\nt\n\u0001\ndt + \u03c3\u03c1dW 0\nt + \u03c3\np\n1 \u2212 \u03c12dW i\nt ,\nfor i = 1, . . . , N. So the states evolve according to an Ornstein-Ulhenbeck like process\nwhich is Gaussian if the initial conditions are Gaussian (or deterministic).\nSearching for a closed loop Nash equilibrium \u03b2 = (\u03b2t)0\u2264t\u2264T with \u03b2t = \u03c8t(Xt) is\nusually done by deriving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the system of value\nfunctions of the players, but in this particular instance, it can also be done using the Pon-\ntryagin stochastic maximum principle.

The same remarks apply to the Ornstein-\nUlhenbeck nature of the state evolutions in equilibrium. However, what is remarkable\nis the fact that the open loop Nash equilibrium happens to be in closed loop form, but still,\nit is not a closed loop Nash equilibrium. This is very different from the situation for plain\noptimization. In fact, it reinforces the message that looking for a Nash equilibrium is a far\ncry from solving an optimization problem.\nThe second point we want to emphasize is that both Riccati equations, and hence both\nsolutions, coincide in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. More on that below.\nThe interested reader can \ufb01nd complements and detailed proofs in [21, Section 2.5].\nRelevance to Mean Field Games (MFGs). Mean Field Games have been touted as\nthe appropriate limits of N player games when N \u2192 \u221e. However, beyond appealing in-\ntuitive arguments and rigorous proofs that MFG solutions can be used to construct strategy\npro\ufb01les forming approximate Nash equilibria for N player games, the larger N, the bet-\nter the approximation, proving actual convergence is a dif\ufb01cult problem. See for example\nD.Lacker chapter in this volume.\nIn the present situation, because of the explicit nature of the solutions of the \ufb01nite\nplayer games, we can take the limit N \u2192 \u221e in the dynamics of the states, in the Nash\nequilibrium controls (open and closed loop), and in the expected costs optimized by the\nplayers, all that despite the presence of the common noise. In fact, we can read off the\nimpact of the common noise in the limit N \u2192 \u221e where the open and closed loop models\ncoincide. This limit can formally be identi\ufb01ed to the so-called Mean Field Game model,\nand we can even identify the Master Equation from the large N behavior of the system of\nHJB equations.\nMFGs as Models for Systemic Risk. Being set up in continuous time, the above\nmodel is multi-period in nature. This is in sharp contrast with most of the existing math-\nematical models of systemic risk which are most often cast as static one-period models.\nStill, one of the most valuable feature of the model presented above is being explicitly\nsolvable.\nOn the shortcoming side, I need to admit that this is a very naive model of bank lending\nand borrowing. Among its undesirable features, the model does not have any provision for\nborrowers to repay their debts ! Moreover, despite explicit solutions, it gives only a small\njab at the stability properties of the system.\nStill, the model raises interesting challenges and it seems reasonable that it can be\nmade more realistic and more useful with some mathematically tractable add-ons. We cite\nthree of them for the sake of illustration.\n\u2022 The introduction of major and minor players in this model will allow to capture\nthe crucial role played by the SIFIs discussed in the introduction to this section.\nGame models with major and minor players experienced a renewal of interest\nrecently, and systemic risk seems to be a perfect testbed for their implementation.\n\u2022 In order to palliate some of the unrealistic features of the original model, Car-\nmona, Fouque, Moussavi and Sun suggested the introduction of time delays in\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "83a38e7c-ea19-47ae-ae7f-3813c541f5f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "83a38e7c-ea19-47ae-ae7f-3813c541f5f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "6", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "6\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nthe controls in [25]. While increasing the technicalities of the proofs and pre-\ncluding explicit solutions, this extension of the model includes provisions for\nborrowers to repay their debts in a \ufb01xed amount of time.\n\u2022 As another example of the fact that systemic risk is a fertile ground for the in-\ntroduction and analysis of new MFG models, we mention the recent paper by\nBenazzoli, Ciampi and Di Persio [17] in which the authors study a simple illiq-\nuid inter-bank market model, where the banks can change their reserves only at\nthe jump times of some exogenous Poisson processes with a common constant\nintensity.\n\u2022 Also noteworthy is a recent paper [69] of Nadtochyi and Shkolnikov who study\nthe mean \ufb01eld limit of systems of particles interacting through hitting times.\nTheir model was motivated by the contagion of the times of default of \ufb01nancial\ninstitutions in periods of economic stress. It would be interesting to add the opti-\nmization component to their model and study the endogenously made decisions\nof the participants.\n\u2022 Finally, the introduction of graphical constraints should be a good way to quan-\ntify the various levels of exchanges between the \ufb01nancial institutions. Introduc-\ning a weighted graph of interactions between the players of the game changes\ndramatically the mean \ufb01eld nature of the model, and new solution approaches\nwill have to be worked out for any signi\ufb01cant progress to be made in this direc-\ntion. Still, despite the obvious challenges of this research program, it is under\nactive investigation by many \ufb01nancial engineers.\n2.2. Price Impact and Optimal Execution. High frequency markets offer another\nfertile ground for applications of \ufb01nancial engineering. Among other things, they high-\nlighted the importance of price impact and optimal execution. The search for the best\npossible way to execute a given trade is an old problem and the presence of price impact\ndid not have to wait for the popularity of the high frequency markets.\nA Model for Price Impact. We brie\ufb02y review an MFG model of price impact intro-\nduced by Carmona and Lacker in [27]. There, it was solved in the weak formulation, but\nfor the purpose of the present discussion the speci\ufb01c approach used to get to a solution will\nnot really matter.\nWe start with a model for N traders. We denote by Xi\nt the inventory (i.e. the number\nof shares owned) at time t by trader i, and we assume that this inventory evolves as an It\u00f4\nprocess according to\n(2.7)\ndXi\nt = \u03b1i\nt dt + \u03c3idW i\nt\nwhere \u03b1i\nt represents the rate of trading of trader i. This will be their control. Wi =\n(W i\nt )t\u22650 are independent Wiener processes for i = 1, . . . , N, and \u03c3i represents an id-\niosyncratic volatility. We assume that it is independent of i for simplicity. Note that in\nessentially all the papers on the subject this volatility is assumed to be 0. In other words,\ninventories are assumed to be differentiable in time. Our decision to work with \u03c3i = \u03c3 > 0\nis backed by empirical evidence, at least in the high frequency markets, as demonstrated\nby Carmona and Webster in [30]. Next, we denote by Ki\nt the amount of cash held by trader\ni at time t. We have:\ndKi\nt = \u2212[\u03b1i\ntSt + c(\u03b1i\nt)] dt,\nwhere St is the transaction price of one share at time t, and the function \u03b1 \u2192 c(\u03b1) \u2265 0\nmodels the cost for trading at rate \u03b1. As explained in [30], this function c should be thought\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "6a0b118f-3600-41e4-9585-c1e2cad81b1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a0b118f-3600-41e4-9585-c1e2cad81b1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "7", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING & ECONOMICS\n7\nof as the Legendre transform of the shape of the order book. So for a \ufb02at order book we\nshould have:\nc(\u03b1) = c\u03b12.\nWe model the time evolution of the price St using the natural extension to the case of N\ntraders of the price impact formula of Almgren and Chriss [7]:\ndSt = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nh(\u03b1i\nt) dt + \u03c30dW 0\nt\nfor some non-negative increasing function \u03b1 7\u2192 h(\u03b1) and a Wiener process W0 =\n(W 0\nt )t\u2265 independent of the other ones.

Several important remarks are in order at this stage.\n(1) The above model is the epitome of a N-player stochastic differential game.\n(2) The state equations are given by (3.1). They are driven by the N independent\nidiosyncratic noise term dW i\nt . The common noise W0 disappeared from the\noptimization problem only because of the risk neutrality of the traders, namely\nthe fact that they minimize the expectations of their costs. Should they choose to\nminimize a nonlinear utility function, the common noise would not disappear !\n(3) Another remarkable property of this model, and one of the reasons its analysis\nwas of great interest, is that it is one of the earliest MFG models for which the\nmean \ufb01eld interaction occurs naturally through the controls. An early analysis of\nthese MFGs within the probabilistic approach was given in [21, Section 4.6].\nWhile the model formulated above is for N traders, the mean \ufb01eld formulation N \u2192\n\u221e is clear. A complete solution of this limit MFG in the weak formulation can be found\nin [27] and in [21, Section 4.7] for the strong formulation. Later on, it was revisited\nby Cardaliaguet and Lehalle in [18] where the authors consider agents\u2019 possible hetero-\ngeneities, and the introduction of \ufb01ctitious plays which gives a learning twist to the model.\nIt was also extended by Cartea and Jaimungal in [32], to formulate an optimal execution\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "2bc433c6-6c22-489a-bb17-bfe85108fdd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bc433c6-6c22-489a-bb17-bfe85108fdd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "8", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "8\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nproblem for which the authors could still provide solution formulas in quasi explicit forms.\nGame models for optimal execution in the presence of price impact did not wait for the\ntheory of MFGs to catch the interest of \ufb01nancial economists and \ufb01nancial engineers.

I came across the\npotential application of Mean Field Games to the important problem of bank runs by at-\ntending Jean Charles Rochet\u2019s lectures at the Vancouver Systemic Risk Summer School in\nJuly 2014, and the talk given by Olivier Gossner during the conference following the sum-\nmer school. Both works [71, 46] are reported in detail in [21, 22]. Here, we only review\nthe second one because it \ufb01ts better in the class of continuous time models on which we\nconcentrate in this chapter.\nIn the spirit of the discussion to follow, it is worth mentioning the works of Morris and\nShin [68] and He and Xiong [56]. Like most economists, they use a model of the economy\nwith a continuum of players based on an atomless measure space. Our goal is to recover\ntheir models starting with \ufb01nitely many players and then, analyze the mean \ufb01eld limit.\nA Continuous Time Model for Bank Runs. Following Gossner\u2019s talk mentioned ear-\nlier, we consider a group of N depositors with individual initial deposits in the amount\nDi\n0 = 1/N for i = 1, . . . , N. They are promised a rate of return r > r where r is the cur-\nrent prevailing interest rate. We assume that the value Yt of the assets of the bank at time\nt follows an It\u00f4 process and that Y0 \u2265 1. We also assume the existence of a deterministic\nfunction y 7\u2192 L(y) giving the liquidation value of the bank assets when Yt = y. One can\nimagine that the bank has a rate r credit line of size L(Yt) at time t, and that the bank uses\nthis credit line each time a depositor runs (withdraws their deposit).\nNext, we assume that the assets mature at time T, and that no transaction takes place\nafter that. If at that time YT \u2265 1, every one is paid in full, but if YT < 1 we treat this case\nas an exogenous default. We talk about an endogenous default at time t if depositors try to\nwithdraw more than L(Yt) at that time.\nAs time passes, each depositor has access to a private signal Xi\nt satisfying:\ndXi\nt = dYt + \u03c3dW i\nt ,\ni = 1, . . . , N,\nand at a time \u03c4 i of their choosing, they can attempt to withdraw their deposit, de facto\ncollecting the return r until time \u03c4 i, and trying to maximize:\nJi(\u03c4 1, . . . , \u03c4 N) = E\n\u0014\ng(\u03c4 i, Y\u03c4 i, \u03c4 \u2212i)\n\u0015\nwhere we use the standard notation \u03c4 \u2212i = (\u03c4 1, . . . , \u03c4 i\u22121, \u03c4 i+1, . . . , \u03c4 N), and for example\ng(t, Yt, \u03c4 1, . . . , \u03c4 N) = e(r\u2212r)t\u2227\u03c4 + e\u2212rt\u2227\u03c4(L(Yt) \u2212 Nt/N)+ \u2227 1\nN ,\nNt = #{i; \u03c4 i \u2264 t} is number of withdrawals before t, and\n\u03c4 = inf{t; L(Yt) < Nt/N}\nis the \ufb01rst time the bank cannot withstand the withdrawal requests.\nFirst, let us try to derive some conclusions if the depositors had full information, in\nwhich case Yt would be public knowledge, and \u03c3 would be 0, i.e.\u03c3 = 0. If we also assume\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "21b91511-70ea-4605-ac50-bf116940fb5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "21b91511-70ea-4605-ac50-bf116940fb5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "9", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING & ECONOMICS\n9\nthat the function y ,\u2192 L(y) is known to the depositors, then it is easy to check that in any\nequilibrium:\n\u03c4 i = inf{t; L(Yt) \u2264 1}.\nSo all the depositors withdraw at the same time (they all run on the bank simultaneously)\nand each depositor gets their deposit back: no one gets hurt!. Clearly this scenario is unfor-\ntunately, highly unrealistic. We should expect that depositors wait longer before running\non the bank, presumably because they only have imperfect information (i.e. noisy private\nsignals) on the health of the bank.\nGames of Timing. Let us consider a population of N players with individual states\nXN,i\nt\nat time t satisfying equations of the form\ndXN,i\nt\n= b(t, XN,i\nt\n, \u03bdN\nt )dt + \u03c3(t, XN,i\nt\n)dW i\nt ,\ni = 1, . . . , N\ncoupled through their empirical distribution\n\u03bdN\nt = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\n\u03b4XN,i\nt\n.\nEach player chooses a FXi - stopping time \u03c4 i and tries to maximize\nJi(\u03c4 1, . . . , \u03c4 N) = E\n\u0014\ng(\u03c4 i, X\u03c4 i, \u00b5N([0, \u03c4 i])\n\u0015\nwhere \u00b5 =\n1\nN\nPN\ni=1 \u03b4\u03c4 i is the empirical distribution of the \u03c4 i\u2019s, g(t, x, p) is the reward to\na player for exercising their timing decision at time t when their private signal is Xi\nt = x,\nand the proportion of players who already exercised their right is p. Taking formally the\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e in this set-up, we obtain the following MFG formulation of a mean \ufb01eld\ngame of timing.\nAssuming that the drift is independent of the empirical distribution of the states for the\nsake of simplicity, i.e. b(t, x, \u03bd) = b(t, x) the dynamics of the state of a generic player are\ngiven by an It\u00f4 equation of the form:\ndXt = b(t, Xt)dt + \u03c3(t, Xt)dWt.\nWe denote by FX = (FX\nt )0\u2264t\u2264T the information available to the agent at time t, and by\nSX the set of FX-stopping times. The MFG of timing paradigm can then be formulated as\nfollows:\n(1) Best Response Optimization: for each \ufb01xed environment \u00b5 \u2208 P([0, T]) solve\n\u02c6\u03b8 \u2208 arg\nsup\n\u03b8\u2208SX,\u03b8\u2264T\nE[g(\u03b8, X\u03b8, \u00b5([0, \u03b8]))]\n(2) Fixed Point Step: \ufb01nd \u00b5 so that\n\u00b5([0, t]) = P[\u02c6\u03b8 \u2264 t]\nHere and throughout, we denote by P(A) the space of probability measures on A.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "e9604e3d-f5af-421a-a9ea-a6a4b6fb937f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9604e3d-f5af-421a-a9ea-a6a4b6fb937f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "10", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "10\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nExistence with randomized stopping times. In an unpublished PhD thesis, Geoffrey\nZhu proposed an existence proof for randomized stopping times, providing an analog of\nNash\u2019s original existence theorem for the existence of equilibria in mixed strategies.\nBefore we go any further, recall the sobering shortcoming of convergence in distribu-\ntion which says that even if\n(\nlimn\u2192\u221e(X, Yn) = (X, Y )\nin law\nYn is a function of X\nthen Y is not necessarily a function of X, in other words, Y \u2208 \u03c3{X} may not hold.\nFor the purpose of this existence proof, let us assume that the reward function g :\n[0, T] \u00d7 R \u00d7 P([0, T]) \u220b (t, x, \u00b5) 7\u2192 g(t, x, \u00b5) \u2208 R is bounded, continuous in (t, x) for\n\u00b5 \ufb01xed, and Lipschitz continuous in \u00b5 for (t, x) \ufb01xed.

Existence for standard stopping times can be\nshown to hold under a different set of assumptions, using for example the order structure\nof the space of stopping times instead of topological properties of this space. For example,\nif we assume that the time increments of g are monotone in \u03bd, then we can use the fact that\nthe space of stopping times is a complete lattice, check that\n\u03c4 ,\u2192 arg sup\n\u03c4 \u2032\u2208S\nE[g(\u03c4 \u2032, X\u03c4 \u2032, F\u03c4(\u03c4 \u2032))]\nis monotone, and use Tarski\u2019s \ufb01xed point theorem.

Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin Mining. Given the fact that the Bitcoin mania\nhits the \ufb01nancial markets on a recurrent basis, and because of the competitive nature of the\nmining process involving a large number or miners, it is no surprise that mean \ufb01eld game\nmodels have been proposed to analyze some of the features of the cryptocurrency space.\nHere we brie\ufb02y review two very recent papers by Li, Reppen and Sircar [65] and Bertucci,\nBertucci, Lasry and Lions [12] which use continuous time mean \ufb01eld games, though in\nvery different ways, to analyze some of the features of cryptocurrency generation. Both\npapers envision a continuum of miners interacting through the aggregate computational\npower they allocate to mining the blockchain.\nEven though it is not the only cryptocurrency, we shall only talk about Bitcoin because\nit is the one getting the most press. There are many reasons for that, wild price moves being\nde\ufb01nitely one of them. After brie\ufb02y exceeding $12,000, it crashed down to the $10,000\nrange, before quickly moving up again to high levels.\nThe generation of bitcoins is based on blockchain technology. The latter was intro-\nduced for the purpose of record keeping in a decentralized ledger. Still, it is at the core\nof bitcoin generation. In bitcoin production, independent miners compete for the right to\nrecord the next transaction block on the blockchain. They follow a Proof-of-Work (PoW)\nprotocol. Their goal is to solve mathematical puzzles designed to be solved by brute force\nonly. Computations to solve puzzles (create a block and earn a reward) are otherwise to-\ntally useless as they are not applicable anywhere else. Once a miner obtains a solution,\nthe corresponding block is added on top of the blockchain and the miner obtains their re-\nward. This reward is paid out in cryptocurrency (a \ufb01xed number of bitcoins, currently\n12.50 bitcoins for adding a block) while electricity and mining hardware need to be paid\nwith traditional \ufb01at currency (like the US Dollar).\nThe supply of bitcoins is constantly growing. However, it is limited to 21 million,\nof which more than 17 million are already in circulation. The security of the network is\na serious issue. A major fear is a majority attack also called 51% attack when a group\nof users controls the majority of mining power. These instances are rare, mostly because\nthey are very dif\ufb01cult to realize due to their enormous costs. They are not considered in\n[65, 12].\nThe computing power devoted to mining is called the hash rate. It captures the num-\nber of trials per second trying to solve the mining puzzle. In order to maintain stability in\nthe blockchain, the mining puzzle dif\ufb01culty is dynamically adjusted so that, on average,\nthe time between the creation of two consecutive blocks is constant, currently approxi-\nmately 10 minutes. Therefore as the hash rate increases, the dif\ufb01culty increases so that it\nis required to compute more hashes for a given block.\nMiners control their hash rate to increases their share of the blockchain reward, all\nother things being equal, while reducing the share of the other miners. On the other hand,\nintensive computations consume a lot of energy and each miner faces signi\ufb01cant electricity\ncosts. In a nutshell, this dilemma is the core of the individual miner optimization problem.\nThe aggregate hash rate in the system represents the total computational power devoted to\nblock creation. In both papers this aggregate hash rate will be the source of the mean \ufb01eld\ninteraction between the miners.\nIn [65], Li, Reppen, and Sircar focus on the risk borne by risk-averse miners and study\nmining concentration. They use a jump process to represent the acquisition of the reward,\nthe jump intensity being the control of the typical miner.

The number of rewards each miner receives is modeled by a\ncounting process Nt with jump intensity \u03bbt > 0. If the number of miners is M + 1, this\nintensity is given by\n\u03bbt =\n\u03b1t\nD(\u03b1t + M \u00af\u03b1t)\nwhere M \u00af\u03b1t approximates the total hash rate of the other miners. The wealth of the miner\nis used as state variable. It evolves as an It\u00f4 process of the form\ndXt = \u2212c\u03b1tdt + PdNt\nwhere P is the bitcoin price, so the value of each reward is the product of its quantity\nby P. As we mentioned earlier, 12.50 bitcoins are granted to a miner for adding a block\nsuccessfully. The total number of rewards in the system as a whole is a Poisson process\nwith a constant intensity D > 0. This will play the role of a common noise in the model.\nGiven an adapted process \u00af\u03b1 = (\u00af\u03b1t)t\u22650 representing the conditional mean of the con-\ntrols given the common noise, the miner optimization problem is to maximize the expected\nutility of wealth at a \ufb01xed terminal time T:\nv \u00af\u03b1(t, x) =\nsup\n\u03b1\u2208[0,A(x)]\nE\n\u0002\nU(XT ) | Xt = x\n\u0003\nwhere the controls \u03b1 are restricted to the interval [0, A(x)] when the state is x.

The authors provide an explicit solution for exponential utility and no liquidity\nconstraint. They go on to the analysis of the effect of liquidity constraints and more general\nutility functions. They provide robust numerical procedures to compute the equilibrium. In\nthe case of the CRRA power utility function, they study the concentration of wealth among\nthe miners. Their conclusion is that the richer the miner, the wealthier they will get.\nThe authors also introduce a model in which one special miner is singled out for\nhaving a signi\ufb01cant cost advantage (e.g. bene\ufb01tting from cheaper electricity prices) over\nthe remaining \ufb01eld of miners. Naturally this special miner is shown to contribute more to\nthe hash rate.\nBertucci, Bertucci, Lasry and Lions use a different modeling approach. Very much in\nthe spirit of the work [64] proposing a mean \ufb01eld approach to the dynamics of an order\nbook in the high frequency markets, they directly introduce the master equation, arguing\nthat this is the best way to study mean \ufb01eld games. Notice that this is in sharp contrast with\nthe usual approach starting from the introduction of the agents maximization problems.\nUsing their notation system, P is now the nominal hashrate, (number of hashes per\nsecond).

The evolution of Kt is modeled in continuous time as miners\ncontinuously acquire computing power to compute hashes.

Again,\nthe monotone structure of the MFG plays a key role in the well-posedness of these models.\nIndeed, existence and uniqueness follow from monotonicity, and the existence of a station-\nary state is also proven and analyzed. This is proven in [12] when g is bounded from above\nand below.\n[12] also discusses model security against attacks, proposes extensions to several com-\npeting populations of miners facing different mining costs, and a market where mining\nequipment can be bought and sold.\n3. Games Models for Energy and the Environment\nIn this section we review some of the MFG models which have been touted and used\nto revisit and extend earlier economic analyses of energy and environment markets. We\n\ufb01rst summarize the discussion given in [21, Section 1.4.4] of a \ufb01rst model proposed by\nGu\u00e9ant, Lasry and Lions in [54].\n3.1. MFG Models for Oil Production. If we denote by x1\n0, . . . , xN\n0 the initial re-\nserves of N oil producers who control their own rates of production, and if we denote by\nXi\nt the oil reserves of producer i at time t, the changes in reserves should be given by\nequations of the form\n(3.1)\ndXi\nt = \u2212\u03b1i\ntdt + \u03c3Xi\ntdW i\nt\nwhere \u03c3 > 0 is a volatility level common to all the producers, the non-negative adapted\nand square integrable processes \u03b1i = (\u03b1i\nt)t\u22650 being the controls exerted by the producers,\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "5d356d17-a4df-485b-a335-975a306fccc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d356d17-a4df-485b-a335-975a306fccc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "14", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "14\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nand the Wi = (W i\nt )t\u22650 independent standard Wiener processes. If we denote by Pt the\nprice of one barrel of oil at time t, and if we denote by C(\u03b1) =\nb\n2\u03b12 + a\u03b1 the cost of\nproducing \u03b1 barrels of oil, then producer i tries to maximize:\n(3.2)\nJi(\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1N) =\nsup\n(\u03b1t)t\u22650,\u03b1t\u22650\nE\n\u0014 Z \u221e\n0\ne\u2212rt[\u03b1i\ntPt \u2212 C(\u03b1i\nt)]dt\n\u0015\n,\nwhere r > 0 is a discount factor. As we are about to explain, the price Pt is the source of\ncoupling between the producers\u2019 strategies. The notion of general equilibrium is intended\nto characterize situations in which all the producers manage to maximize their pro\ufb01ts si-\nmultaneously, and the market clears in the sense that demand matches supply. Let us de-\nnote by D(t, p) the demand at time t when the price is p. The function D(t, p) = we\u03c1tp\u2212\u03b3\nwas used in [54]. We use the obvious notation D\u22121 for the inverse demand function, i.e.\nq = D(t, p) \u21d0\u21d2 p = D\u22121(t, q).\nMean Field Formulation. In the present context, the MFG paradigm can be articu-\nlated easily. For each \ufb01xed deterministic \ufb02ow (\u00b5t)t\u22650 of probability measures, we compute\nthe price Pt from the formula:\nPt = D\u22121\n\u0012\nt, \u2212 d\ndt\nZ\nx\u00b5t(dx)\n\u0013\n,\nand the best response to this \ufb02ow of distributions is given by the solution of the discounted\nin\ufb01nite horizon optimal control problem for the instantaneous cost function\nf(t, x, \u00b5, \u03b1) = [\u03b1p \u2212 C(\u03b1)]e\u2212rt\nunder the dynamic constraint (3.1). The MFG will be solved if one can \ufb01nd a measure\n\ufb02ow (\u00b5t)t\u22650 such that the marginal distribution L(Xt) of the solution of the control prob-\nlem matches the \ufb02ow we started from, namely \u00b5t = L(Xt) for all t \u2265 0. The analytic\napproach to MFGs based on the solution of a system of coupled HJB and Fokker-Planck-\nKolmogorov equations is used in [54] to give a solution to this problem. Numerical illus-\ntrations provide comparative statics of the solutions are also given.\nVariations and Extensions. In [36], Chan and Sircar propose to look at dynamics\n(3.3)\ndXs = \u2212\u03b1sds + \u03c3dWs,\nXt = x > 0.\nwith a Dirichlet boundary condition at Xt = 0 to guarantee that the reserves of a generic\noil producer do not become negative. As before, \u03b1t represents the rate of production of a\ngeneric producer and Xt represents the remaining reserves. As in most models for Cournot\ngames, the price experienced by the producer, call it Pt for the sake of de\ufb01niteness, is given\nby a linear inverse demand function of the rates of production, and it is chosen to be of the\nform\nPt = 1 \u2212 \u03b1t \u2212 \u03f5\u00af\u03b1t\nwhere \u00af\u03b1t is the mean production rate for all the exhaustible resources. so that the cost\nfunction becomes\nf(t, x, \u00b5, \u03b1) = \u03b1[1 \u2212 \u03b1p \u2212 \u03f5\u03b1]\nwhere \u00b5 denotes the distribution of the control \u03b1 giving the rate of production, \u00af\u03b1 the mean\nof this distribution, and p the price given by the above inverse demand function. This is a\ntypical extended MFG (because the mean \ufb01eld interaction is through the controls) with a\nboundary condition to guarantee that the remaining reserves do not become negative. In\nparallel, the authors propose a slightly modi\ufb01ed model for producers of renewable energy\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "9fb2298d-0455-4379-b88c-7c626781b17b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fb2298d-0455-4379-b88c-7c626781b17b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "15", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING & ECONOMICS\n15\nand analyze the oil market in the presence of both populations of producers. In this paper,\nthey also propose several variations on the above model. Their goal was to include several\nrealistic features like strategic blockading the entrance of renewable producers, and explo-\nration and discovery of new reserves. While not always worrying about all the subtleties\nof mathematical existence theorems, they provide enlightening numerical illustrations of\ntheir conclusions. This prompted more mathematically inclined authors like Bensoussan\nand Graber to pursue in [52] a complete existence analysis based on partial differential\nequations techniques of the models proposed by Sircar and Chan.\nFor the sake of completeness, we mention that plain models for a macro perspective\non the behavior of a large population of oil producers were proposed by Giraud, Gu\u00e9ant,\nLasry, and Lions. See for example [49, 53, 54]. More recently, Achdou, Giraud, Lasry and\nLions revisited some of these models including the presence of major and minor players.\nSee [2]. Also, note that game theoretical approaches, though not involving mean \ufb01eld\ngames per se, were used by Ludkovski and Sircar in [66] to analyze oil production.\n3.2. MFG Models for the Electricity Markets and the Grid. General equilibrium\nmodels have a long history in the engineering literature on electricity pricing. See for\nexample [57] and the references therein. More recently, Djehiche, Barreiro-Gomez and\nTembine proposed a mean \ufb01eld game model for pricing electricity in a smart grid. See\n[41]. Still, to model individual decision in a smart grid, Alasseur, Ben Tahar and Matoussi\nuse in [6] a game with mean \ufb01eld interactions through the controls as a framework to man-\nage storage. In [5], A\u00efd, Dumitrescu, and Tankov use one of the mean \ufb01eld game of timing\nmodels reviewed earlier to capture the time at which renewable producers choose to enter\na new market, and when conventional producers using fossil fuels should exit the market.\nIn a different context, A\u00efd, Basei and Pham investigate in [4] a Stackelberg game model\nwhere the leader (an electricity producing \ufb01rm) and the follower (consumer) choose strate-\ngies possibly depending upon their distributions. So they solve optimal control problems\nof the McKean-Vlasov type. The main emphasis of the paper is to show that the Stackel-\nberg equilibrium is not Pareto optimal, and to explain the economic consequences of this\ndisparity.\nInvestigating the valuation of demand response contracts in a model with a continuum\nof consumers with mean \ufb01eld interactions and the presence of a common noise impacting\ntheir consumptions, Elie, Hubert, Mastrolia, and Possama\u00ef formulate in [43] the problem\nas a contract theory problem with moral hazard as those we shall discuss in more detail in\nSection 6 below. In their model, the Principal is an electricity producer who observes con-\ntinuously the consumption of a continuum of risk averse consumers, and designs contracts\nin order to reduce the production costs. To be more speci\ufb01c, the producer incentivizes\nthe consumers to reduce the average consumptions as well as their volatilities in different\nregimes, without observing the efforts they potentially make. This is exactly the type of\nmodels we shall investigate in Section 6.\nThe recent paper by Shrivats, Firoozi, and Jaimungal [74], still in the context of the\nelectricity markets, offers a smooth transition with the next discussion of the environment\nmarkets. Indeed, it proposes MFG models to derive the optimal behavior of electricity\nproducers and an equilibrium price for Solar Renewable Energy Certi\ufb01cate (SRECs) in\nmarket-based systems designed to incentivize solar energy generation.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "f1c55ae5-88d7-47a6-8615-1e3cf4221729": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1c55ae5-88d7-47a6-8615-1e3cf4221729", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "16", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "16\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\n3.3. Environment Economics. Early general equilibrium models aimed at under-\nstanding the effects and the control of externalities and taxes (in the spirit of Tobin taxes)\nwere proposed by Golosov, Hassler, Krusell, and Tsyvinski in [50]. General equilibrium\nmodels were also used in early works on the emissions markets by Bueler [16] and Haurie\n[55] and more signi\ufb01cantly in the analysis of the European Union Emission Trading Sys-\ntem (EU ETS) by Carmona, Fehr, Hinz and Porchet in [24]. See also the references therein.\nWe argue later on in Section 4 that many general equilibrium models can be recast as Mean\nField Game models. More recently, ideas which \ufb01rst appeared in the treatment of MFGs\nwere used by Bahn, Haurie and Malham\u00e9 to model negotiations related to environment\npolicies. See [9].\nFinally, we mention the recent work of Carmona, Dayanikli and Lauri\u00e8re [20] who\nuse MFG models with major and minor players, very much in the spirit of the contract\ntheory models we review in Section 6, to derive equilibrium analyses of externalities and\nregulation on one end, and investments in renewables on the other, when dealing with\nelectricity production.\n4. Macro-Economic Growth Models\nIn this section, we review several general equilibrium economic growth models. We\nborrowed the \ufb01rst one from a paper by Gu\u00e9ant, Lasry and Lions on mean \ufb01eld games [54].\nWe chose to present it here because, by cleverly adapting ideas from a model of Aghion\nand Howitt, the authors present a model with common noise which can be solved explicitly,\nall the way to the master equation.\nOur choice of the second model was driven by a remarkable property: even though the\noriginal contribution [63] of Krusell and Smith appeared long before the mean \ufb01eld game\nparadigm was articulated, the numerical algorithm proposed by the authors to approximate\nnumerically the equilibrium characteristics, reads as if it had been designed for the compu-\ntation of an MFG equilibrium. Indeed, it is eerie to see how closely the description of their\nnumerical algorithm mimics, step by step, the mean \ufb01eld game strategy based on the alter-\nnate iteration of steps to approach the solution of the HJB equation and the Fokker-Planck\nKolmogorov equation.\nWe learned of the third example presented in this section, from a private conversation\nwith Benjamin Moll. We include it in this review because it can be solved completely, both\nanalytically and numerically. Unfortunately, those examples are few and far between.\nThe interested reader may also want to consult [3] by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and\nMoll for another discussion of continuous time macro-economic models recast as MFGs.\n4.1. A First Example based on Calculus with Pareto Distributions. We introduce\ndirectly the mean \ufb01eld formulation of the game without starting from the de\ufb01nition of the\n\ufb01nite player game because the interaction between the players is local in the sense that it is\na function of the density of the statistical distribution of the states of the players. In the case\nof \ufb01nitely many players, this distribution is the empirical distribution of the \ufb01nitely many\nstates and as such, it does not have a density per se. So in order to avoid the introduction\nof smoothing of the empirical measures to de\ufb01ne the costs to the players, we jump directly\nto the mean \ufb01eld game formulation which can be done directly with densities without any\nneed for molli\ufb01cation arguments.\nIn this model, there are no idiosyncratic shocks, just aggregate shocks common to\nall the players. They are given by the increments of a one dimensional Wiener process\nW0 = (W 0\nt )t\u22650. We denote by F0 = (F0\nt )t\u22650 its \ufb01ltration.

Recall that the MFG par-\nadigm in the presence of a common noise is to solve, for each \ufb01xed F0-adapted \ufb02ow of\nprobability measures (\u00b5t)t\u22650, the optimization problem of a generic player, and then solve\nthe \ufb01xed point problem to guarantee that the \ufb02ow (\u00b5t)t\u22650 we started from is in fact the\n\ufb02ow of conditional marginal laws of the solution of the optimization problem.\nFor this particular family of distributions, if \u00b50 = \u00b5(1), then \u00b5t = \u00b5(qt) where qt =\ne\nR t\n0 \u03b3sds\u2212(\u03c32/2)t+\u03c3W 0\nt . In other words, conditioned on the history of the common noise,\nthe distribution of the states of the players remains Pareto with parameter k if it starts\nthat way, and the left-hand point of the distribution qt can be understood as a suf\ufb01cient\nstatistic characterizing the distribution \u00b5t. So if X0 \u223c \u00b5(1), then \u00b5t \u223c \u00b5(qt). This simple\nremark provides an explicit formula for the time evolution of the (conditional) marginal\ndistributions of the states given the common noise. In general MFGs with a common\nnoise, this time evolution is dif\ufb01cult to determine as it requires the solution of a forward\nStochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE for short).\nUsing the same notation as in [54], we de\ufb01ne the running cost function f by\nf(x, \u00b5, \u03b1) = c\nxa\n[(d\u00b5/dx)(x)]b \u2212 E\np\n\u03b1p\n[\u00b5([x, \u221e))]b ,\nfor positive constants a, b, c, E and p > 1. The economic rationale for the form of this\ncost function and the meanings of the parameters are discussed in [54]. By convention,\nthe density appearing in this formula is the density of the absolutely continuous part of the\nLebesgue\u2019s decomposition of the measure \u00b5, and it is set to 0 when the measure is singular.\nThe argument of the optimization of the Hamiltonian is given by\n\u02c6\u03b1(x, \u00b5, y) =\n\u0010 y\nE\n\u0002\n\u00b5([x, \u221e))\n\u0003b\u00111/(p\u22121)\n.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "e2d1a0ed-e83d-4fbf-b9e0-341f843d7827": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2d1a0ed-e83d-4fbf-b9e0-341f843d7827", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "18", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "18\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nThis formula can be used to write the master equation which, when restricted to one-sided\nPareto distributions, can be reduced to a \ufb01nite dimensional PDE because of the above re-\nmark.

The Krusell - Smith\u2019s Growth Model. One major difference with the growth\nmodel discussed in the previous subsection is the fact that, on the top of the common noise\naffecting all the states, we also have idiosyncratic random shocks speci\ufb01c to each individual\nagent in the economy. In [63] the shocks take only \ufb01nitely many values. We suspect that\nthis restrictive assumption was made for the purpose of numerical implementation. In\nthe next subsection, we change the nature of the random shocks by introducing Wiener\nprocesses to recast the model in the framework of stochastic differential games.\nDescription of the Economy. While economists usually work with models compris-\ning a continuum of players (this is indeed the case in [63]), in order to avoid the discussion\nof measurability issues related to continuum families of independent random variables,\nwe \ufb01rst discuss the model of an economy comprising N consumers. The random shocks\nare given by a set of N continuous time Markov chains (zt, \u03b7i\nt)t\u22650 for i = 1, . . . , N.\nThe common component z captures the health of the overall economy, like an aggregate\nproductivity measure, so for some constant \u2206z \u2265 0, zt = 1 + \u2206z in good times, and\nzt = 1 \u2212 \u2206z in bad times. The idiosyncratic component \u03b7 is speci\ufb01c to the consumer,\n\u03b7i\nt = 1 when consumer i is employed, and \u03b7i\nt = 0 whenever they are unemployed. \u2206z = 0\ncorresponds to the absence of common noise.\nThe production technology is modeled by a Cobb - Douglas production function in the\nsense that the per-capita output is given by\n(4.4)\nYt = ztK\u03b1\nt (\u2113Lt)1\u2212\u03b1\nwhere Kt and Lt stand for per-capita capital and employment rates respectively. The\nconstant \u2113 can be interpreted as the number of units of labor produced by an employed\nindividual. The power \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) is a constant of the model. In such a model, two quantities\nplay an important role: the capital rent rt and the wage rate wt. Economic theory says that\nin equilibrium, these marginal rates are de\ufb01ned as the partial derivatives of the per-capita\noutput Yt with respect to capital and employment rate respectively. So\n(4.5)\nrt = r(Kt, Lt, zt) = \u03b1zt\n\u0000Kt\nLt\n\u0001\u03b1\u22121\nand\n(4.6)\nwt = w(Kt, Lt, zt) = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)zt\n\u0000Kt\nLt\n\u0001\u03b1.\nConsumer\u2019s Optimization Problem.

These limits\ngive the conditional distributions of capital and labor kt and \u03b7t given the state zt = z\nof the economy. Since zt can only take two values 1 \u2212 \u2206z and 1 + \u2206z, we only need\nthe knowledge of deterministic \ufb02ows of measures, (\u00b5k,d\nt\n)t\u22650, (\u00b5k,u\nt\n)t\u22650, (\u00b5\u03b7,d\nt\n)t\u22650, and\n(\u00b5\u03b7,u\nt\n)t\u2265) corresponding to the two values of z, say down and up, namely d = 1 \u2212 \u2206z and\nu = 1 + \u2206z.\nOnce the \ufb02ows of conditional measures are known, the computation of the best re-\nsponse of a representative agent reduces to the solution of the optimal control problem\nmax\nc\nE\n\u0014 Z \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03c1tu(ct)dt\n\u0015\nunder the constraints kt \u2265 0 and\ndkt =\n\u0002\n(r(Kt, Lt, zt) \u2212 \u03b4)kt + [(1 \u2212 \u03c4t)\u2113\u03b7t + \u00b5(1 \u2212 \u03b7t)]w(Kt, Lt, zt)\n\u0003\ndt \u2212 ctdt.\nHere, (zt, \u03b7t)t\u22650 is a continuous time Markov chain with the same law as any of the\n(zt, \u03b7i\nt)t\u22650 introduced earlier, the rental rate function r and the wage level function w are\nas in (5.42) and (4.6), and Kt = k\nzt\nt is the mean of the conditional measure \u00b5zt\nt , namely\nKt =\nZ\n[0,\u221e)\nk\u00b5k,u\nt\n(dk) if zt = 1 + \u2206z,\nand\nKt =\nZ\n[0,\u221e)\nk\u00b5k,d\nt\n(dk) if zt = 1 \u2212 \u2206z,\nand where the aggregate labor Lt is de\ufb01ned similarly as the conditional mean of \u00b5\u03b7,z\nt\n.

Note that\nin the Krusell-Smith\u2019s model, the common noise and the idiosyncratic noise are correlated\nand that the labor state variable \u03b7t (whose aggregate is Lt) is nothing but the idiosyncratic\nnoise. So clearly, the MFG paradigm reduces to the solution of the individual optimization\nproblem given the aggregate Kt and then solving for the \ufb01xed point. This is exactly what\nthe numerical algorithm proposed in [63] does. Time discretization is not needed in [63]\nsince the model is introduced in discrete time there. Then a form of dynamic programming\nis used to solve the optimization problem given the aggregate Kt, and then an update of Kt\nis done by Monte Carlo simulation, before going back to the solution of the optimization\nproblem given the update of Kt, and so on and so forth. While the authors realize that the\nentire distribution \u00b5k,z\nt\nshould be updated, they argue that updating the mean is suf\ufb01cient\nto get reasonable numerical results for a problem whose complexity should have been\nprohibitive. As explained in the introduction, even though they never used the term Nash\nequilibrium, their numerical search for a recursive competitive equilibrium is exactly the\nalgorithm based on the iteration of the numerical approximation of the solution of the HJB\nequation followed by the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, algorithm (re)introduced\nand used over 15 years later for the numerical solution of Mean Field Games.\n4.3. A Diffusion Form of Aiyagari\u2019s Growth Model. As explained in the introduc-\ntion to this section, we learned about the model presented in this subsection from a private\nconversation with Benjamin Moll. It is one of the models discussed in the review [1] by\nAchdou, Buera, Lasry, Lions and Moll devoted to partial differential equation models in\nmacroeconomics. As far as we know, the \ufb01rst, and most likely the only, complete mathe-\nmatical solution as a mean \ufb01eld game of this model can be found in Chapter 3 of [21].\nWe \ufb01rst describe the \ufb01nite player form of the model. We shall solve it as a mean\n\ufb01eld game model later on. The N agents i \u2208 {1, . . . , N} are the workers comprising the\neconomy. The private state at time t of agent i is a two-dimensional vector Xi\nt = (Zi\nt, Ai\nt).\nFor the purpose of this model, Ai\nt is the wealth at time t of worker i, and Zi\nt their labor\nproductivity. The time evolutions of the states are given by stochastic differential equations\n(4.8)\n(\ndZi\nt\n= \u00b5Z(Zi\nt)dt + \u03c3Z(Zi\nt)dW i\nt\ndAi\nt\n= [wi\ntZi\nt + rtAi\nt \u2212 ci\nt]dt.\nThe functions \u00b5Z, \u03c3Z : R \u2192 R are known. We shall specify them later on in the examples\nwe treat theoretically and numerically. The random shocks are given by N independent\nWiener processes Wi = (W i\nt )t\u22650, for i = 1, . . . , N. rt is the interest rate at time t, wi\nt\nrepresents the wages of worker i at time t and the consumption process ci = (ci\nt)t\u22650 is the\ncontrol of player i.\nREMARK 4.1. In many economic applications, a borrowing limit is imposed. Math-\nematically, this means that the wealths must satisfy the constraints Ai\nt \u2265 a\nfor some\nnonpositive constant a \u2264 0. Moreover, the labor productivity processes Zi = (Zi\nt)t\u22650 are\nalso restricted by requiring that they are ergodic, or even restricted to an interval [z, z] for\nsome \ufb01nite constants 0 \u2264 z < z < \u221e. We do not know of an economic rationale for\nthese constraints and we suspect that these assumptions are made for the sole bene\ufb01ts of\nthe technical proofs.\nIn this model, given adapted processes r = (rt)t\u22650 and wi = (wi\nt)t\u22650 for i =\n1, . . . , N, the workers choose their consumptions c1, . . . , cN in order to maximize their\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "26250a70-3e22-4dc3-b671-287995ee76a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "26250a70-3e22-4dc3-b671-287995ee76a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "21", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING & ECONOMICS\n21\nexpected discounted utilities:\n(4.9)\nJi(c1, . . . , cN) = E\nZ \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03c1tu(ci\nt)dt.\nAs usual in economic applications, the model is set up in in\ufb01nite horizon, and u is an\nincreasing concave utility function, the same for all the workers. So far, it seems like\nthe workers do not interact. Also, we need to explain how the interest rate and the wage\nprocesses appear in equilibrium. As in the Krusell-Smith model discussed earlier, we\nassume that the aggregate production in the economy is given by a production function\nY = F(K, L), the total capital supplied in the economy at time t, say Kt being given by\nthe aggregate wealth\n(4.10)\nKt =\nZ\na d\u00b5N\nXt(dz, da) = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nAi\nt\nwhile the total amount of labor Lt supplied in the economy at time t is normalized to 1.\nHere, we denote by \u00b5N\nXt the empirical measure of the sample X1\nt , . . . , XN\nt . Note that only\nthe A-marginal enters the de\ufb01nition of Kt.\nREMARK 4.2. As explained in the introduction, the fact that the economic agents\ninteract through aggregate quantities is the reason why mean \ufb01eld models and mean \ufb01eld\ngame formulations are so natural for these macro-economic models.\nEconomic theory says that in a competitive equilibrium, the interest rate and the wages\nare given by the partial derivatives of the production function\n(\nrt\n= [\u2202KF](Kt, Lt)|Lt=1 \u2212 \u03b4\nwt\n= [\u2202LF](Kt, Lt)|Lt=1\nwhere \u03b4 \u2265 0 is the rate of capital depreciation. So in equilibrium, the interaction be-\ntween the agents in the economy is through the mean Kt =\nR\na\u00b5N\nX(a, z) of the empirical\ndistribution of the workers\u2019 wealths Ai\nt.\nPractical Solution. We now specify the model further to solve it as a mean \ufb01eld game.\nWe use the CRRA isoelastic utility function with constant relative risk aversion introduced\nabove in (4.7). Note that\n(4.11)\nu\u2032(c) = c\u2212\u03b3\nand\n(u\u2032)\u22121(y) = y\u22121/\u03b3.\nNext, we use the Cobb - Douglas production function\n(4.12)\nF(K, L) = A K\u03b1 L1\u2212\u03b1\nfor some constants A > 0 and \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).

Finally, we use\nan Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the mean reverting labor productivity process Z =\n(Zt)t\u22650 by choosing \u00b5Z(z) = 1 \u2212 z and \u03c3Z \u2261 1 for the sake of de\ufb01niteness.

Since the variables\nz and yz do not play any role in the minimization of the Hamiltonian with respect to the\ncontrol variable c, we use the reduced Hamiltonian:\nH(t, a, \u00b5, y, c) =\n\u0000\u2212 c + (\u03b1\u00b5\u03b1\u22121 \u2212 \u03b4)a\n\u0001\ny \u2212 u(c),\nwhich is convex in (a, c) and strictly convex in c.

From Macro to Finance\nIn this section, we review two recent works of M. Brunnermeier and Y. Sannikov\n[14, 15] in which the authors compare the historical evolutions of macro-economic and\n\ufb01nance models, arguing that properly framed, the analysis of continuous time stochastic\nmodels should provide a unifying thread for these sub-\ufb01elds of economics which so far,\ndeveloped in parallel. To make their point, the authors introduce models of the economy\ncomprising households maximizing consumption like in classical macro-economic growth\nmodels, as well as experts trading in \ufb01nancial markets.\nAs explained in the introduction, those models lead to MFGs with a common noise.\nThe importance of common shocks in macro-economics points to the need of a better\nmathematical understanding of MFGs with a common noise. The \ufb01rst model reviewed in\nthis section \ufb01ts in the class of MFGs with one population of individuals facing idiosyncratic\nnoise terms as well as random shocks common to all. It was \ufb01rst introduced in [14] in\ndiscrete time. While the second model does not have idiosyncratic noise terms, it involves\ntwo populations of agents. This gives us an opportunity to quickly review some of the\nfeatures of MFGs with several populations, which are not discussed often enough in the\nmathematical literature on mean \ufb01eld games.\n5.1. Economy with One Type of Agents. We consider a one-sector economy with\na continuum of households with identical preferences (we shall use the logarithmic util-\nity function u(x) = log x) and different levels of wealth. We denote by I the set of\nhouseholds. We choose I = [0, 1] for the sake of de\ufb01niteness. In this model, because each\nagent\u2019s in\ufb02uence on the economy is in\ufb01nitesimal, we use a continuous probability measure\n\u03bb on I to sample households. For practical purposes, we can think of \u03bb as the Lebesgue\nmeasure on [0, 1].\nREMARK 5.1. This suggestion to think of the space of households as the unit interval\n[0, 1] equipped with its Lebesgue measure is a \ufb02agrant expediency. Indeed, mathematically\nspeaking, it does not pass the smell test, as in order to manipulate a continuum of idiosyn-\ncratic shocks without having to face severe measurability issues, we would have to jump\nthrough several hoops, for example using rich Fubini extensions instead of the Lebesgue\nunit interval. See for example [21, Section 3.7] for a discussion of such a rigorous ap-\nproach.\nIn this model, each household operates a \ufb01rm and holds money. The capital stock of a\ngeneric household h evolves according to the equation:\n(5.1)\ndkh\nt\nkh\nt\n= (\u03c6(\u03b9h\nt ) \u2212 \u03b4)dt + \u03c30dW 0\nt + \u03c3dW h\nt\nwhere \u03b4 > 0 is a depreciation rate, and the function \u03c6 re\ufb02ects adjustment costs in capital\nstock. This function is assumed to satisfy \u03c6(0) = 0, \u03c6\u2032(0) = 1, \u03c6\u2032(\u00b7) > 0 and \u03c6\u2032\u2032(\u00b7) <\n0. Its concavity captures technological illiquidity. \u03b9h\nt represents the investment rate of\nhousehold h in physical capital at time t. Essentially, it gives how many units of physical\ncapital are used in order to produce new physical capital. W0 = (W 0\nt )t\u22650 and Wh =\n(W h\nt )t\u22650 are independent Wiener processes modeling random shocks. dW h\nt represents an\nidiosyncratic shock speci\ufb01c to the household h, while dW 0\nt represents a shock common to\nall the households. We shall often call it the common noise. The volatilities \u03c30 and \u03c3 are\npositive constants.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "5e6e122b-2a31-4a8f-ba37-f1abb02155a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e6e122b-2a31-4a8f-ba37-f1abb02155a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "24", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "24\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nHouseholds hold money. We denote by mh\nt the amount of money held at time t by\nhousehold h. They consume in the amount ch\nt . We denote by \u03b8h\nt the fraction of the house-\nhold wealth in money at time t. So the control of a household is the triple (\u03b9h\nt , \u03b8h\nt , ch\nt ). The\ngoal of a household is to maximize its long-run discounted expected utility of consumption:\n(5.2)\nJh(\u03b9, \u03b8, c) = E\nhZ \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03c1tu(ct)dt\ni\nover the control strategies (\u03b9, \u03b8, c) = (\u03b9t, \u03b8t, ct)t\u22650. The constant \u03c1 > 0 provides actual-\nization. We now derive the dynamic constraint under which this optimization is performed\nby each household. It is expressed in terms of the wealth nh\nt of the household at time t.\nWe use capital letters to denote the aggregates (i.e. the empirical means) of each of\nthe variables kh\nt , mh\nt and nh\nt .

The idiosyn-\ncratic shocks disappear because of a continuous form of the exact law of large numbers.\nSee for example [21, Section 3.7]. We used the notation \u00af\u03b9t to distinguish this aggregate\nreturn on capital from the individual households\u2019 \u03b9h\nt .\nWe introduce two more constants: q for the price of one unit of physical capital (so\nthe real value of aggregate physical capital is qKt), and p for the real value of money\nnormalized by the size of the economy as measured by Kt (so pKt is the real value of\ntotal money supply). These could be It\u00f4 processes, say (qt)t\u22650 and (pt)t\u22650 driven by the\ncommon noise W0, but for the sake of simplicity, we shall assume them to be deterministic\nconstants for the purpose of this presentation. Given the de\ufb01nition of the constants q and\np, the total wealth in the economy is\n(5.5)\nNt = (p + q)Kt,\nqKt representing the value of the physical capital and pKt the value of the nominal capital.\nWe denote by \u03d1 the fraction of nominal wealth:\n(5.6)\n\u03d1 =\np\np + q .\nThe quantity of money in the economy is controlled exogenously by a central bank.

Since the state variable\nof an individual household is its wealth nh\nt , the typical interaction one should expect if this\ngeneral equilibrium can be recast as a mean \ufb01eld game should be the aggregate wealth Nt.\nSo in the presence of the common noise W 0\nt one should \ufb01x the \ufb02ow of conditional distri-\nbutions of the wealth nh\nt given the \ufb01ltration of the common noise, and search for the best\nresponse of this household. In other words, given the knowledge of (Nt)t\u22650 which is a\nstochastic process adapted to the \ufb01ltration F0 of W0, the individual household should \ufb01nd\noptimal investment rate in physical capital (\u02c6\u03b9t)t\u22650, optimal investment portfolio (\u02c6\u03b8t)t\u22650,\nand optimal consumption rate (\u02c6ct)t\u22650, to maximize its long-run discounted expected utility\nof consumption (5.2). This is exactly what was done in the section dealing with the individ-\nual household optimization problem. The next step of the MFG paradigm is the \ufb01xed point\nstep according to which one tries to identify a \ufb02ow of conditional distributions which ends\nup being the \ufb02ow of conditional distributions of the solution of the optimization problem\nunderpinning the search for the best response.\nIn typical macro-economic general equilibrium problems, individual optimizations are\nperformed assuming that the aggregates are known. If aggregates can be interpreted as\nmeans of some state variables, \ufb01xing the aggregates amounts to \ufb01xing the distributions of\nthese state variables. In this example, assuming the knowledge of (Nt)t\u22650 is the same thing\nas assuming the knowledge of (Kt)t\u22650 since as we saw, Nt = \u03c1(p+q)Kt, which in turn, is\nassuming the knowledge of the process (\u00af\u03b9t)t\u22650 representing the aggregate investment rate\nin physical capital. This is the mean \ufb01eld interaction appearing explicitly in the dynamics\n(5.13) of the state of the individual household. Since the individual household optimal\ninvestment rate in capital is constant as given by Tobin\u2019s q equation (5.15), a necessary\ncondition for the \ufb01xed point step is that \u00af\u03b9t = \u02c6\u03b9t. Added to the necessary conditions of\noptimality (which we derived from the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle) and the\ncapital market clearing condition, this \ufb01xed point step leads to the equilibrium solution\nunder the conditions (5.28).\nBecause we chose to restrict ourselves to the search for a stationary general equilib-\nrium in which the processes (pt)t\u22650 and (qt)t\u22650 are deterministic and constant given by\nthe real numbers p and q, the deterministic nature of most of the characteristics of the equi-\nlibria are rather anti-climatic, and the reformulation of the solution as the search for Nash\nequilibria in a mean \ufb01eld game is rather contrived. We chose to present this model because\nof the presence of both idiosyncratic and common shocks. We refer the interested readert\nto [14, 15] for extensions with deeper \ufb01nancial meaning. The next example will be more\nillustrative of the deep connection with the paradigm of mean \ufb01eld games. While it does\nnot involve idiosymcratic shocks, it involves two populations and this will give us a chance\nto highlight the possible bene\ufb01ts of a mean \ufb01eld game reformulation of the model.\n5.2. Economy with Two Types of Agents. We present the analysis of the model dis-\ncussed in [15] mutatis mutandis. We consider an economy with a continuum of households\nand experts. We denote by Ih (resp. Ie) the space of households (resp. experts). Typi-\ncally, we choose Ih = Ie = [0, 1] which we assume to be equipped with its Borel \u03c3-\ufb01eld.\nWe shall alo use continuous probability measures \u03bbh and \u03bbe on Ih and Ie respectively.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "adb68e62-70f5-424f-9036-445be50deff6": {"__data__": {"id_": "adb68e62-70f5-424f-9036-445be50deff6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "30", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "30\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nAgain, for practical purposes, and modulo the contents of Remark 5.1 at the beginning of\nthe discussion of the previous model, we can think of them both as equal to the Lebesgue\nmeasure on [0, 1].\nIn this economy, households consume and lend money to experts. On the other end,\nexperts borrow money from households, invest in the production of a single good, and con-\nsume. The goal of each agent is to maximize their long run expected utility. In this model,\nall agents use the logarithmic utility function u(c) = log c.

Moral Hazard & Contract Theory\nAfter reviewing some of the major historical developments in contract theory, and ex-\nplaining the basics of the models, we concentrate on two recent papers using mean \ufb01eld\ngames for the purpose of extending the reach of possible applications of the theory to large\npopulations of agents. Because this topic was not discussed as a possible application of\nMean Field Games in the books [21, 22], we spend a signi\ufb01cant amount of time review-\ning the underpinnings of the economic theory as well as some of the recent applications\ninvolving mean \ufb01eld models.\nPut in layman\u2019s terms, the purpose of economic contract theory is to address questions\nof the type: a) How should a government control a \ufb02u outbreak by encouraging citizens to\nvaccinate? b) How should taxes be levied to in\ufb02uence people\u2019s consumption, saving and\ninvestment decisions? c) How should an employer incentivize and compensate their em-\nployees in order to boost productivity? While these are mundane objectives, they should\nshed some initial light on the type of problems contract theory can encompass. The eco-\nnomic lingo we shall use and try to elucidate includes terms like\nAgency Problem, Contract Theory, Moral Hazard, and Information Asymmetry.\n\u2022 The agency problem refers to a con\ufb02ict of interest between two parties when one\nof them is expected to behave in the other party\u2019s best interests.\n\u2022 The purpose of contract theory is to study how an economic agent can design\nand structure a contractual agreement to incentivize another agent to behave in\nhis or her best interest. This problem is most often set up when the informations\navailable to the two agents are not the same.\n\u2022 In economics and in \ufb01nance, moral hazard refers to a situation when an agent has\nan incentive to take excess risk because they do not bear the full consequences\nof that risk.\n\u2022 In contract theory and economics, information asymmetry deals with the study\nof decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than\nthe other.\n\u2022 The principal - agent problem occurs when one agent makes decisions on behalf\nof another person or entity called the principal.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "27bbd32e-5405-4f3f-99de-6085ae49c8db": {"__data__": {"id_": "27bbd32e-5405-4f3f-99de-6085ae49c8db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "39", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING & ECONOMICS\n39\nEarliest contributions to this important \ufb01eld of economics concentrated on static one\nperiod models. They are attached to the names of Mirrlees [67] and Holmstr\u00f6m [58, 59].\nThe \ufb01rst dynamic models were introduced by Holmstr\u00f6m and Milgrom [60, 61] and it had\nto wait almost two decades for Sannikov\u2019s breakthrough [72, 73]. By focusing on Markov\ndiffusion models in continuous time, and using the weak formulation of stochastic control\nproblems to capture moral hazard, Sannilov created a new wave of interest, especially\namong \ufb01nancial mathematicians. The book of Cvitanic and Zhang focusing on the use of\nBackward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) is a case in point, and the more recent\nwork of Cvitanic, Possama\u00ef and Touzi [40] highlighting the real nature of Sannikov\u2019s trick,\nwill be instrumental in the developments we present in this section.\nNB: Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m and Oliver Hart were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Eco-\nnomic Sciences in 2016 for their work on Contract Theory.\n6.1. Standard Data for a Contract Theory Problem. In a classical contract theory\nmodel, two parties are present:\n(1) the principal who devises a contract, according to which incentives are given to,\nand/or penalties are imposed on,\n(2) the agent who may accept the contract and work for the principal.\nThe following are the major assumptions which are usually made implicitly or explicitly\nin a contract theory model.\n\u2022 It is assumed that all the agents are rational in the sense that they behave op-\ntimally to maximize their own utilities, controlling the tradeoff between the re-\nwards/penalties they received and the efforts they put in.\n\u2022 The principal designs the contract\n\u2022 After reviewing the terms of the contract, the agent may walk away. We as-\nsume that the agent has a threshold level (e.g. minimum reward, ..... ) below\nwhich they think the contract is not worth the effort. We call this threshold the\nreservation utility of the agent.\n\u2022 The principal observes the agent actions only partially. This is the source of\ninformation asymmetry and moral hazard in the problem.\nFrom a mathematical point of view, the fact that the principal de facto does not see all\nof the agent behavior forces a special formulation of the optimization problem faced by the\nprincipal. As far as we know, Sannikov was the \ufb01rst one to realize that this situation was not\naccommodated properly by the usual mathematical strong formulation of stochastic games\nand stochastic control. He proposed to use the weak formulation of stochastic control\n(also called the martingale approach to stochastic control) to set the principal optimization\nproblem. We now explain what we mean by weak formulation to accommodate moral\nhazard.\n6.2. Weak Formulation for Control & Two-Player Games. We denote by X0\nt the\nstate of the system at time t. We shall give detailed explanations of what the state is in\neach of the applications considered below. We assume that the system is controlled by\none single controller who takes actions to implement their control. The actions of the\ncontroller affect the state of the system and the level of the cost / reward. This describes\nthe set-up of a classical control problem. Games and stochastic games differ in the sense\nthat several controllers can act on the same system, i.e. several controllers (players, agents)\ntake actions. In this case, each player has a cost / reward to worry about, and the whole\nsystem is affected by the individual actions and their interactions.

In this set-up the trajectories t ,\u2192 X0\nt (\u03c9) are not\naffected by the actions taken by the controllers. Only the likelihood of the scenarios given\nby the trajectories can be changed by the controls. In other words, only the distribution of\nthe process X0 = (X0\nt )0\u2264t\u2264T is affected by controls. In words, one can surmise that the\nchoice of a control is equivalent to the choice of a law for the state process.\nStill, it may not be completely clear why the presence of moral hazard and the lack\nof symmetry of information suggest the use of the weak formulation. Given the terms of\nthe contract, the Agent chooses controls which in\ufb02uence their own reward, as well as the\nrewards of the Principal. Let us denote by \u03b1t the control (effort level) of the agent at time\nt. The agent sees the state Xt as it is impacted by the control, and the agent optimizes their\ncost / reward according to the terms of the contract.\nOn the other end, through the terms of the contract, the Principal chooses the remuner-\nation conditions of the agent. But he or she does so without observing directly the effort\nlevel \u03b1t of the agent, observing only partially the state Xt, and seeing the impact of the\nagent\u2019s effort only through the expected returns he or she is getting, de facto through the\nvalues of expected quantities\nRoughly speaking, the principal guesses the expected value of his or her returns through\nthe distribution of the output of the agent. This is exactly what the weak formulation ap-\nproach is trying to capture. See below for the mathematical details of this approach.\nAfter this quick and informal review of moral hazard and classical contract theory, we\nnow introduce the application we have in mind in this chapter.\n6.3. Contract between One Principal and MANY Agents. The main features of\nthe new framework can be summarized as follows:\n(1) ONE principal who devises one single contract, according to which incentives\nare given to, and/or penalties are imposed on,\n(2) MULTIPLE agents who see the same contract and may accept it and work for\nthe principal.\nAs before, the major assumptions can be captured in a small number of bulllet points:\n\u2022 The principal designs a contract hoping to maximize their own utility;\n\u2022 The agents are rational so they will also try to maximize their own utilities;\n\u2022 The agents have their reservation utilities and so they may decide to walk away;\n\u2022 The agents are statistically identical in that their contracts are the same;\n\u2022 They behave sel\ufb01shly and maximize their utilities;\n\u2022 We assume that they reach a Nash equilibrium;\n\u2022 The Principal designs the contract anticipating that the agents will reach a Nash\nequilibrium.\nIn some sense, we can say that we are considering the problem of one principal contracting\na \ufb01eld of agents. As before, the principal does not see (and cannot control) the individual\nactions taken by the agents. The principal only feels the overall expected value of the re-\nward he or she gets from the actions of the agents. This information asymmetry creates the\nmoral hazard which the model captures through the weak formulation of the optimization\nproblem.\nBelow, we give mathematical details when the state space is the Euclidean space Rd\n(originally treated by Elie, Mastrolia and Possama\u00ef in [45]) and the case of \ufb01nite states\ntreated by Carmona and Wang in [29, 28].\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "6342c98d-53a4-48de-b11c-37d9763c4a73": {"__data__": {"id_": "6342c98d-53a4-48de-b11c-37d9763c4a73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "41", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING & ECONOMICS\n41\n6.4.

We use the notation X\u00b7 and x\u00b7 to denote the whole trajectories of the state. Note\nalso that:\n(6.1)\ndX0\nt = \u03c3(t, X0\n\u00b7 )dWt,\nunder P\nirrespective of which control is chosen by the agent.\nNext we introduce A, the space of admissible control strategies (representing the\nagents effort levels). The elements of A are adapted processes \u03b1 = (\u03b1t)0\u2264t\u2264T which\nmay satisfy further properties to be speci\ufb01ed later on. Next we introduce the drift function\nb (the only part of the dynamics of the state controlled by the agent). We assume that the\ndrift (t, x, \u03b1) 7\u2192 b(t, x\u00b7, \u03b1) \u2208 Rd is bounded and progressively measurable. For each ad-\nmissible control strategy \u03b1, we denote by P\u03b1 the state distribution when the effort level of\nthe agent is \u03b1. It is de\ufb01ned by its density with respect to the measure P given by:\ndP\u03b1\ndP = E\nhZ T\n0\n\u03c3(t, X0\n\u00b7 )\u22121b(t, X0\n\u00b7 , \u03b1t)dWt\ni\nwhere E(M) = exp[Mt \u2212 1\n2 < M, M >t] denotes the Doleans exponential of the contin-\nuous square integrable martingale M = (Mt)0\u2264t\u2264T . Girsanov theorem implies that:\ndX0\nt = b(t, X0\n\u00b7 , \u03b1t)dt + \u03c3(t, X0\n\u00b7 )dW \u03b1\nt ,\nunder P\u03b1\nwhere\nW \u03b1\nt = Wt \u2212\nZ t\n0\n\u03c3(s, X\u00b7)b(s, X\u00b7, \u03b1s)ds\nis a Brownian motion under the measure P\u03b1. So the same state process X0, constructed\nin (6.1) independently of the controls \u03b1, now appears as the state of the process controlled\nby \u03b1 if one looks at its evolution under the probability measure P\u03b1. More on that remark\nbelow.\nWe now \ufb01nalize the weak formulation of the problem by describing the behaviors of\nthe agents in this set-up.\nThe principal offers a contract (r, \u03be) where\n\u2022 r = (rt)0\u2264t\u2264T is an adapted process representing the payment stream;\n\u2022 \u03be is a random variable representing a terminal payment.\nThe agent decides whether or not to accept the contract and work for the principal, and if\nhe or she does accept, chooses an effort level \u03b1 = (\u03b1t)0\u2264t\u2264T to maximize their expected\noverall reward:\nJr,\u03be(\u03b1, \u00b50) = EP\u03b1h\nUA(\u03be) +\nZ T\n0\n[uA(rt) \u2212 c(t, X\u00b7, \u03b1t)]dt\ni\nwhere uA is the agent running utility, UA is the agent terminal utility, and c(t, x\u00b7, \u03b1) is the\ncost for applying the effort level \u03b1 at time t when the history of the state is x[0,t].\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "a7dbf8c3-fc96-49f1-a726-1ae90ba57285": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7dbf8c3-fc96-49f1-a726-1ae90ba57285", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 53, "source": "42", "document_type": "research_paper", "title": "Applications of Mean Field Games in Financial Engineering and Economic Theory", "authors": "Rene Carmona", "pdf_link": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05237v1", "release_date": "2020-12-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "42\nREN\u00c9 CARMONA\nGiven this rational expected behavior of the agent, the optimization problem of the\nprincipal can be formulated in the following way:\nFor each contract (r, \u03be), assuming knowledge of the utility and cost functions of the\nagent and assuming that the agent is rational, the Principal computes an optimal effort level\n\u03b1\u2217 = (\u03b1\u2217\nt )0\u2264t\u2264T\n\u03b1\u2217 \u2208 arg inf\n\u03b1\u2208A Jr,\u03be(\u03b1, \u00b50)\nwhich the agent should choose, and then, search for an optimal contract (r\u2217, \u03be\u2217)\n(r\u2217, \u03be\u2217) \u2208 arg inf\n(r,\u03be) EP\u03b1\u2217 h\nUP\n\u0010\nXT \u2212 \u03be \u2212\nZ T\n0\nrtdt\n\u0011i\nwhere UP is the (terminal) utility of the principal.\nThis is a typical instance of a Stackelberg game between the principal going \ufb01rst and\nthe agent.\nWhat Changes with a Large Number of Agents.

We\ngo over a numerical application in detail to illustrate with a few statics, the informational\ncontent of the equilibrium when we can actually compute it.\n6.5. The Discrete State Case. The framework of the above discussion is based on\nthe theory of diffusion processes in continuous time and its application to problems of\nstochastic control. The states are living in Euclidean spaces, their dynamics are mod-\neled by stochastic differential equations, and sophisticated tools from stochastic analysis,\nstarting with Girsanov\u2019s theory of changes of measure, are brought to bear in order to\nformalize the asymmetry of information and the weak formulation appropriate for the op-\ntimization of the Principal. Stochastic dynamical systems taking values with \ufb01nite state\nspaces are often used in applications for which numerical implementations are of crucial\nimportance. Strangely enough, what seems like a simpli\ufb01cation at \ufb01rst, after all \ufb01nite\nstate spaces should be easier to handle than continuous spaces, may not always make the\ntheoretical analysis easier. Here, we review recent works attempting to port the strategy\noutlined in the previous section to this case. In particular, we explain how to set up the\nweak formulation for Mean Field Games with \ufb01nitely many states, and we implement the\nsteps previously outlined in the diffusion case in the framework of \ufb01nitely valued state\nprocesses.\nREMARK 6.2. Mean Field Games with \ufb01nitely many states have caught the atten-\ntion of the MFG crowd throughout the past decade. All the works dated before 2017 are\nreviewed thoroughly and commented from an historical perspective in [21, Section 7.2].\nSee also [22, Section 7.1.9] for a discussion of models with major and minor players, the\nanalysis of which bears much resemblence to some of the steps taken to state and solve\ncontract theory problems with a large number of agents. For the sake of completeness, we\nmention some of the works on \ufb01nite state space mean \ufb01eld games which appeared since\nthen, and which we know of. The probabilistic approach to \ufb01nite state mean \ufb01eld games\nis advocated by Cecchin and Fischer in [33], Bayraktar and Cohen derived the equivalent\nof the master equation in [10], and the convergence problem is studied in [42] by Doncel,\nGast and Gaujal, and in [34] by Cecchin and Pelino. Finally, we note that these models can\nexhibit all sorts of behavior as shown for example in [35] where Cecchin, Dai Pra, Fischer\nand Pelino identify a two-state model without uniqueness.\nThe following is a review of results of Carmona and Wang borrowed from [29, 28].\nThe Canonical Process for the Discrete Case. In this section, we assume that the state\nspace is the \ufb01nite set E = {e1, . . . , em}, where for the sake of mathematical convenience\nwe shall assume that the ei\u2019s are the unit vectors of the canonical basis of Rm.

We illustrate this result on a concrete example.\nA Simple Model of Epidemic Containment. I feel compelled to offer a disclaimer\nbefore presenting the gory details of the model I propose to use as illustration. Peiqi Wang\nand I concocted this model over three years ago for the purpose of illustrating the inner\nworkings of the theory and the analytic computations presented in [28]. In the Spring of\n2020, when the paper was accepted for publication in Management Science, the Editor in\nChief asked if we could add a discussion to highlight the relevance of this kind of model to\nthe understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. We obliged, and while doing so, I realized\nthe potential of these new tools to inform policy makers in the control of the spread of\nepidemics, and the localized re-opening of an economy after shut-down. Given the dire\nconditions in which we are \ufb01nding ourselves at this very moment, Aurrell, Dayanikli,\nLauri\u00e8re and I embarked in a systematic investigation of what extensions of the model\ncould bring to the understanding of the health and economic consequences of regulations.\nThis effort resulted in [8]. The reader interested in applications of similar equilibrium view\nto epidemic control can also consult the recent work of Elie, Hubert and Turinici [44].\nBelow, we present the model originally introduced in [28], where plenty numerical\nillustrations are given illustrating the in\ufb02uence of the various parameters of the model, and\nin particular, how the contract proposed by the regulator can in\ufb02uence the propensity of\nthe agents to move from one city to another.\nA regulator tries to control the spread of a virus over a time period [0, T]. The ju-\nrisdiction of the regulator consists of two cities, say A and B. Each individual is ei-\nther infected (I) or healthy (H), lives in city A or B. So the state space of the model\nis E = {AI, AH, BI, BH} and we denote by \u03c0AI, \u03c0AH, \u03c0BI, \u03c0BH the proportions of\nindividuals in each of these states.\nTo describe the time evolution of the state of each individual we introduce the follow-\ning assumptions:\n(1) the rate of contracting the virus depends on the proportion of infected individuals\nin the city so the\n\u2013 transition rate from state AH to state AI is \u03b8\u2212\nA(\n\u03c0AI\n\u03c0AI+\u03c0AH )\n\u2013 transition rate from state BH to state BI is \u03b8\u2212\nB(\n\u03c0BI\n\u03c0BI+\u03c0BH ).\n(2) the rate of recovery is a function of the proportion of healthy individuals in the\ncity, so the\n\u2013 transition rate from state AI to state AH is \u03b8+\nA(\n\u03c0AH\n\u03c0AI+\u03c0AH )\n\u2013 transition rate from state BH to state BI is \u03b8+\nB(\n\u03c0BH\n\u03c0BI+\u03c0BH ).\n(3) Each individual can try to move to the other city: we denote by \u03bdI\u03b1 the transition\nrates between the states AI and BI, and by \u03bdH\u03b1 the transition rates between the\nstates AH and BH.\n(4) Status of infection does not change when individual moves between cities.\nThe non-negative functions \u03b8\u2212\nA, \u03b8\u2212\nB, \u03b8+\nA and \u03b8+\nB are increasing, differentiable on [0, 1].\nThey characterize the quality of health care in the cities A and B. So we can change their\nparameters to make it more or less attractive to individuals to move from one city to the\nother, or to stay put.

My background is\nas an entrepreneur advisor to startup companies, as a\ndeveloper as well. So I got started about 15 years\nago building companies. Since I was in university, my\nfirst business was actually importing scooters from\nChina to the US. If you kind of Google my scooter\nstory, it was actually a failure. That led to my next\nventure, which was going around the world teaching\npeople about lean startup, which is about how to\nvalidate your startup ideas before you build them and\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "0d3d9440-cffc-4a91-88c0-99d5d43d9f2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d3d9440-cffc-4a91-88c0-99d5d43d9f2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 31, "source": "3", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E86: Creating The Best Community For Builders on Bitcoin - Trevor Owens - Partner at Stacks Ventures", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyLq2vAWHaQ", "release_date": "2022-08-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "invest too much time and money in them.

I\nlearned a lot from him, as well as from many other\npeople in the lean startup community, like Brent\nCooper, who we've actually brought into the\naccelerator about this customer development process.\nAnd I created one of the largest grassroots organized\nstartup training camps called Lean Startup machine\nthat we did in something like 150 cities around the\nworld. And we created a bunch of tools. I worked with\ngracing, who's the creator of Crash punk, she's my co\nfounder. And she did all the branding for lean\nstarter machine and ran a lot of the workshops. And\nwe consulted with some of the largest Fortune 500\ncompanies in the world, like GE, American Express,\nyou name it.\n00:05:02.974 - 00:05:42.826, Speaker C: Microsoft. If\nthere's a Fortune 500 company doing like innovation\nor tech, they've probably been through my training\ncamp. And I also went over to China and started\nteaching innovation to Huawei and Tencent, which was\na very interesting experience. And along the way, I\nadvised hundreds of founders around the world. One of\nthe founders that I worked more closely with was the\nfounders of stacks. So Ryan Shea and Maneib Ali, when\nthey were getting off the ground originally, they\nwent through multiple iterations.

My\noriginal hypothesis on bitcoin was simply around\nremittances, an alternative to western union. For me,\nI really look at the use cases. I really look at what\nare people doing with it. Is there value for end\nusers? A technology has no value without market\napplication. And so I don't care what the technology\nis unless people can get value out of it.\n00:21:06.660 - 00:21:40.858, Speaker C: The market\ncap of the technology is going to be based on the\ntotal sum number of users and the value that's\ncreated.

And bitcoin as a technology,\n2013 was like a really good means to do that. And so\nwhat I was looking at was like, I looked at a report\nthat actually Barry Silbert put out in DCG talking\nabout if bitcoin was to capture the remittance\nmarket, then the market cap would be like $3,000 per\ncoin, right? And so that's kind of like what I\nestimated. And that's why I started buying when it\nwas like $100 and I bought a ton of it, and then it\ngot up to like $1,000, and I bought on the way up and\nthen got to $1,000.

And so I stayed very\nclear away from it at that point. And then coming\nback into the 2020 cycle, that was when I first saw\nDFI and NFTs, and I saw people actually using it, and\nI saw that there are real applications being built on\ntop of Ethereum and other blockchains other than\nbitcoin. And that was when I finally believed that\nthis would be something.

Right? Not there's any problem with that. I'm\nnot trying to say that's a bad thing, but there's a\nbig difference between a new Internet and a new\ncomputing platform, and the potential that that can\nbe built on top of that with dows and new forms of\ngovernance and new forms of ownership, than just\nsolving the double spend problem through bitcoin.\nIt's not to minimize bitcoin, because the fact that\nEthereum is working and can work, proves to me that\nbitcoin will come full circle and has the potential\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "946d1854-e1ec-4724-afe3-8837dfebb07e": {"__data__": {"id_": "946d1854-e1ec-4724-afe3-8837dfebb07e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 31, "source": "13", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E86: Creating The Best Community For Builders on Bitcoin - Trevor Owens - Partner at Stacks Ventures", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyLq2vAWHaQ", "release_date": "2022-08-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "to become the world's money.

It's\nwon that narrative. We won't talk about the ETH\nultrasound. That's Tom foolery.\n00:26:20.898 - 00:26:57.810, Speaker A: But you\nmentioned something about the block space might be\nthe most valuable thing about bitcoin. Kind of\nalluding to, like, it might not just be the BTC,\nthat's the thing. It's the ledger, it's the\nsettlement layer.

They don't think\nabout building products.

I think\nthat they are very complementary, but they are\ncompetition.\n00:29:33.502 - 00:30:09.854, Speaker C: So I think\nthat's like, from my perspective, bitcoin is not\nguaranteed to make it. The Nazis could have won World\nWar II. Russia, the Soviet Union could have been the\nfirst one to land on the moon. The good guys don't\nalways win. The fact that bitcoin is so decentralized\nand so politically neutral, probably 80% of the world\ndoesn't care, like 80% of the users out there. They\nonly care about the actual using the product. Right?\nPeople use Facebook every day.\n00:30:09.854 - 00:31:09.410, Speaker C: They don't\ncare that Mark Zuckerberg is stealing all your data\nand monetizing your private information to the extent\nthat he can, people still use it. And so we need to\nbe very vigilant to protect and make sure that\nbitcoin succeeds. And if Ethereum, or if Ethereum,\nnot trying to paint Ethereum, is the bad guy here,\nbut another chain gets way more users and way more\nusage. And that chain is not decentralized like\nbitcoin, and not neutral in the way that bitcoin is,\nbitcoin could lose, and that would be a huge loss to\nthe world and to society. And so it's incumbent upon\nus to implement the best of web3 on top of bitcoin so\nthat bitcoin can continue its hegemony and be the\nnumber one chain so that we can have the neutrality\nand decentralization of bitcoin.\n00:31:10.630 - 00:31:53.342, Speaker A: Yeah, there's\nsomething weird about the bitcoin community where\nthey almost like there's already so much momentum\nthat I can just take my foot off the gas and this\ntrain is going to go.

It was like the first co working\nspace incubator in the New York tech scene. This is\nlike 2000 and maybe eleven. No, maybe 2010. Anyway, I\nwas actually intern for the venture capital fund that\nran the space, Polaris Ventures, and Ryan was also an\nintern there. Ryan's a couple years, a couple of\nyears younger than me. And yeah, we just kind of hit\nit off and started going to different tech events\ntogether and made some mutual friends.\n00:33:18.938 - 00:33:50.950, Speaker C: Ryan helped\nme organize this meetup that we did called the\nstudent New York tech meetup in the summer, which was\nlike the New York tech meetup in New York is like\nhuge.

You'll see like an old\npicture of me on the landing page.\n00:37:47.682 - 00:38:15.098, Speaker C: And it was\njust a way to register basically like BNS. It was\nbasically like ENS or Bns before that existed. And\nthey created a little landing page. It was very\nactually like lean, startup oriented. Like they\ncreated a landing page and they had people register\nand they sent it out through social media. And then\nthey got all these top Silicon Valley vcs to register\ntheir domain name on it.

If you\ncan do that and you've identified with the killer\nfeatures, you build one feature, that's the fastest\nway to be successful. That's literally what they did\nwith one name. They built one feature, like, just\nregister your name. Then they got from now from DCG\nto register his name, Naval Ravikant, to register a\nname. All the vcs registered their names.\n00:38:38.846 - 00:39:09.606, Speaker C: And then\nthat's how they raised their round, like overnight,\nbecause people were using their product. And when\nVCC, other vcs are using their product, they get\nsuper, um. It was very clever and it was very lean\nand they validated the product and raised capital in\none go.

So actually working\nhands on with companies and helping them to run their\nbusiness and helping them be more successful. Right.\nThat's another role of a VC. The third role is then\ndeal making. So actually getting into deals.\n00:41:10.062 - 00:41:44.554, Speaker C: So being able\nto meet a founder, convince them to work with you,\nconvince them to take your money, work out a deal,\nget into the best deals.

Because when they say it's\ndefault alive kind of thing, you need to have the\nmoney to sustain to get over that chasm, is that what\nyou mean?\n00:42:24.528 - 00:43:33.550, Speaker C: No, what I\nmean is that there's certain companies where it's so\nobvious, let's say Jack Dorsey starts his next\ncompany. Okay? Everyone wants to invest in that for\nthese really obvious. What we do at the accelerator\nwe do at Sax ventures is not really that we're\ninvesting much earlier than that. Somebody like, look\nat what Maneib did, right? Like he raised 150,000,000\noff the jump for trust machines, okay? Getting into\nrounds like that is what I mean by deal making, where\nit's like someone can get anyone they want to invest\nin it, you know what I mean? And vcs have to fight to\nget into it. How are you going to get your money in\nthat round? Right? And so actually being a better\noperator really helps with that, right? But it may\nnot be like one for one related, right?

If you're just really good at deal\nmaking, maybe you don't know anything. You have no\nskill as an operator, but you can still get into the\ngood deals. But what we do with sax ventures, of\ncourse, we're trying to invest in the most\ncompetitive rounds as possible.

If\nyour idea is actually something that makes sense,\nit's going to work in the market that has validation\nbehind it and fits into the patterns of what we're\nseeing be really, you know, the pre accelerator is a\nreally good place to go.

But the bar for having something that can be\nreally successful really easily is like what we're\nlooking for. And then just seeing that the team is\ncomplete, so that you have the classic three roles\nthat we look for in a team is the hustler, the\nhacker, and the hipster. So the hustler is that\nbusiness founder who's going to be really successful\nat raising, who's charming, who can attract talent,\nwho is resilient, that's coachable, and can do\nmarketing, and is able to go out there and be, we\nsay, squeaky as a wheel, the squeaky wheel gets the\ngrease, tactfully and tastefully shameless out there\npromoting the business.

It's not fun to be\ncritical of founders, especially because I, I love\nfounders so much.

GitHub,\ncopilot, no code tools. And so I'm seeing there's\ndigital scarcity, that blockchain kind of like,\nbrings.

I don't\nhave a well formed thought on this because you're\njust throwing this at me, but I think technology sort\nof happens on the edges, like at the extremes, right?\nYeah, it's fascinating. Digital scarcity. I mean, in\nsome ways. In some ways, we don't have pure digital\nscarcity. It's like, really up to. There's more and\nmore nfts out right there.\n00:54:32.226 - 00:55:12.560, Speaker C: There's more\nand more tokens and stuff like that. But it's more\nlike digital scarcity in terms of, like, a flight, a\nflight to quality, right. And I think that the\naccessibility of the Internet tends to lead to power\nlaw outcomes, right. So when anything is a click\naway, people only go for the first and the best.\nRight. So while there is a ton of abundance, we're\nalso seeing a gravitation towards consolidation of\npower law, distribution, of more inequality. You know\nwhat I'm saying? And so in today's world, inequality\nis actually raising more and more, polarization is\nincreasing more and more.\n00:55:12.560 - 00:56:17.300, Speaker C: And I think\nit's just sort of a. We're in a society right now\nwhere I guess most of the systems that we've known\nover the last 100 years are breaking down. Like\ncapitalism is sort of breaking down in interesting\nways, where we're seeing more inequality. And I don't\nknow what the answer is, man, but I think that in a\nway blockchain to me represents more of a\nmeritocracy. So with respect to dows, with respect to\nownership, I think that the goal of bitcoin people\nsay, which I agree with, is to separate money from\nthe state, right? That's such a noble purpose. The\ngoal of web3 is to separate data and ownership from\ncorporations to everyone, and to allow more people to\nhave voice in our economy with things that we own.\nRight, like our personal property.\n00:56:17.300 - 00:56:41.680, Speaker C: And so with\nrespect to that, I think we're moving in the right\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "27b7ca44-8606-4652-afc1-a5bd4ae8ac3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "27b7ca44-8606-4652-afc1-a5bd4ae8ac3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 31, "source": "28", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "E86: Creating The Best Community For Builders on Bitcoin - Trevor Owens - Partner at Stacks Ventures", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyLq2vAWHaQ", "release_date": "2022-08-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "direction.

Well done, Trevor. Okay,\nlast little spitball question I've been thinking\nabout is someone on Twitter brought up, they were\ngetting in fights with bitcoin maxis, and they were\ntalking about tokens are kind of like proxy equity.\nAnd that idea is fascinating, where it's like equity\nis this idea that you can put in money and you get a\npercentage of a business, but there's like securities\nlaws and there's accredited investor laws, and it\nfeels very archaic. It feels unattainable to someone\nlike me at my stage. But tokens feel much more\ntransparent, democratic in some sense, accessible.\nHow do you think about this idea of tokens are kind\nof proxy equity?\n00:57:27.870 - 00:58:08.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean,\nthat's what I think as well. I think that the closest\nanalogy to tokens is a form of equity, and it should\nrepresent an ownership share over an open source\nprotocol. And so I think of tokens as like\ndecentralized equity because it's only not a security\nif it's decentralized. So by that nature, a token\nmust be decentralized equity in order for it not to\nbe a security. And so there's many open source. Open\nsource has a long history, well before blockchain, if\nyou look at stacks, ethereum, et cetera, they're all\nopen source. And that's what makes it not a security,\nis that there's multiple different companies and\nstakeholders.\n00:58:08.194 - 00:58:46.130, Speaker C: You're not\ndependent on any one company to grow the thing.

And so even this\npodcast is kind of like that, where it's like, one,\nI'm pushing myself, but two, I'm trying to hopefully\ninspire one or two people to listen this episode and\ndo that thing.\n01:01:21.530 - 01:01:21.846, Speaker C: So.\n01:01:21.868 - 01:01:28.200, Speaker A: Yeah, that\nsounds freaking incredible, dude. Yeah, that's great.\n01:01:29.290 - 01:01:58.370, Speaker C: Well, that's\nwhy people love watching your podcast, dude, because\npeople know that you're just approaching it from such\na genuine perspective. And I remember when I first\nsaw you recording on Twitter. I forget where I first\nsaw you, but I was super excited and jazzed about\nthat, you know, starting this podcast. And I'm just\nso grateful to you to see how far you've come and how\nmuch effort you've put into supporting the stacks\necosystem. So hats off to you, Jake, for all that\nyou've done.\n01:01:58.520 - 01:02:10.482, Speaker A: Thank you.\nThank you so much. It means a lot. Okay, not even\nlast question. Let's just close this out. This has\nbeen a fantastic conversation.

It's aa super far in the future surreal Sci-\nFi RPG game that you've seen the footage on Twitter.\nIt looks incredible. And yeah, today we have Rodrigo\non the podcast. We talk about Moonray. We talk about\nNFTs, the ultimate vision of Moonray, which is to\nbecome one of the metaverses that we're all going to\ntap into.\n00:01:09.730 - 00:01:31.286, Speaker B: Once graphics\ngets good enough and the technology evolves a little\nbit, we will be going into Moonray with our digital\nassets and hanging out, kicking ass, whatever we want\nto do.

Doing research on you was pretty interesting.\nWe've all seen the amazing gameplay video on Twitter,\nand I was at the demo day, so I got to see you crash\nZoom. That was dope. My pleasure. But then I got to\nlisten to some other podcasts, and you kind of go\ndown some rabbit holes of aliens, and you got some\nbackground in photography. And so I went to that,\nwent to your website, went down that hole.\n00:02:26.502 - 00:02:40.622, Speaker B: So I'm not\nsure where to start or how fast I want to lose the\naudience, where we should take this, but I guess\nlet's just start with kind of like what your brief\nbackground is and how you got into creating Moonray\nand starting element 115.\n00:02:40.756 - 00:03:01.830, Speaker A: Yeah, no\nproblem. So my background is math, computer science.\nThat's what I studied in school years ago, and then I\nmoved to Silicon Valley after college. I worked there\nfor like three years, like a consulting company.\nWe're doing basically marketing consulting for tech\nstartups. And then I worked in my family's business.\nMy family is a business.\n00:03:01.830 - 00:03:28.160, Speaker A: Something\ntotally different did that for like 15 years, like a\nfood processing startup. And then three years ago, I\nwanted to get back into tech and I really wanted to\nget into game. I just always liked graphics and\nvisual stuff. So I was just really impressed with the\ntechnology that's available now with Unreal Engine\nand just the 3d pipelines in general. Zbrush. I've\nbeen using Zbrush for years and years and years. I\nthink it's still like the most amazing software\nprogram ever made.\n00:03:28.160 - 00:04:07.802, Speaker A: It's really\nincredible. So I just thought, I just started\nexperimenting with Unreal. And initially I want to do\nsomething that was more like along the lines of music\nvisualization.

So basically you play a song, and\nas the song is playing, you draw on a wacom like a\ntablet, and that records the data that you're\nessentially drawing the music as the music's playing.\nAnd then you can do that for different tracks, like\nfor the bass track, for the drum tracks, et cetera,\nand then use that data to synchronize any type of\nvisual in unreal engine. But then I just figured, so\nwe have that, and everything in the game actually\nsynchronizes to music.\n00:04:07.802 - 00:04:51.622, Speaker A: We haven't\nshown that yet. But then I just thought, okay, this\nis really cool, but the market, to make a real\nproduct, it has to be a game. So that's when I\nstarted thinking, okay, I've got to really take this\nmore down the route of making a game. And so that was\nlike three years ago is when I started that. And then\neventually it just kind of grew and grew until we\nstarted making Moon Ray itself and started putting\nthe team together and finding cool programmers,\nespecially like algorithmic programmers, which I\nreally like. So we've got a lot of really cool real\ntime graphics, like fluid simulations and physics\nsimulations that we do, because I just think it's\nreally cool. So that's when we just started making\nthis really far future, surreal kind of Sci-Fi kind\nof world, because that's just kind of what I'm into.\n00:04:51.622 - 00:05:11.534, Speaker A: That's why I\nlike aliens, because I just think it's cool. And I\njust think that most of the stuff that we have now,\nto me, it's just getting kind of boring. It's like\nthe same games. There's nothing wrong with a medieval\ngame or near future game. There's a market for that.\nAnd I play those games, and I love Sekiro and games\nlike that. I love that kind of historical or\npseudohistorical genre, but just everyone's doing it.\n00:05:11.534 - 00:05:39.346, Speaker A: Everyone's\ndoing it.

That's why I always say when\nyou see reports, I don't know if you follow ufos, I\nfollow really closely, but there's reports now of\nflying pyramids buzzing our navy destroyers off the\ncoast of California.

I haven't dug deep into UFOs.\nI haven't spent any time on it, but I know I saw they\ndeclassified a bunch of things in the past couple of\nyears, it seems like. And that's caused a crazy\namount of stir because you have an entity that has an\nimmense amount of resources to do research on these\nthings, and they're like, we have no clue. I don't\nknow.\n00:06:45.360 - 00:06:56.898, Speaker B: And it's\nbreaking the mold of what something like that should\nmove.

They can stop\nand start. They can make 90 degree turns. They don't\nseem to be affected by inertia at all. So it's like\nsome sort of bubble that they're creating, some sort\nof, like, spacetime bubble. I mean, who knows how it\nworks? My suspicion is it's all actually\nelectromagnetic, and we just don't understand\nelectromagnetism.\n00:07:25.370 - 00:07:47.106, Speaker A: I think that\nwe have to look at what Tesla did a whole lot more\nlike the historical Tesla.

I mean, hopefully it\nheads it. Yeah. When you have total control over\nmatter, then you can convert anything into anything\nelse. Then all the distinctions between different\ntypes of matter just start to go away, because I\nimagine if you have enough energy, you can convert\nany type of matter into any other type of matter, and\nso then it really doesn't matter.

The metaverse becomes where we just\nput our consciousness into the machine, and we become\nlimitless, not bounded by any kind of material. Now,\nand that's kind of like that. But you still have some\nlimitations in how much Miam you have access to. Is\nthat kind of the bounds currently?\n00:10:58.756 - 00:11:18.758, Speaker A: Exactly. So\nyou have to collect it. The more you collect it, the\nmore you can cool stuff you can create and craft and\nweapons and things like that. So that is like, the\nresource that you'll have to collect.

And then now\nwe're in kind of the play to earn or the free to\nplay, but you just kind of like nickel and dime\npeople for every little thing for skins and avatars.\n00:11:44.750 - 00:11:50.334, Speaker B: How do you\nthink about the current model or the model we're\ngoing into?\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "4abe1ede-4ae6-44e4-8748-e3c72bf3f156": {"__data__": {"id_": "4abe1ede-4ae6-44e4-8748-e3c72bf3f156", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 21, "source": "8", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "Top-Tier Gaming comes to Bitcoin via Stacks - Founder of Moonray - Rodrigo Etcheto Interview", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N9MXPkyo_8", "release_date": "2021-10-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "00:11:50.532 - 00:11:51.454, Speaker A: I think it's\nreally different.\n00:11:51.492 - 00:11:51.966, Speaker B: Understand\nit?\n00:11:51.988 - 00:12:14.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I think\nit's really different in gamers. There's a negative\nperception among gamers and I think it's going to\nchange. I think it's going to take a year or two\nuntil people understand what play to earn and what\nthis new economic model is. It's a complete shift\nbecause people are thinking like, oh, you're doing\nnfts and crypto, you're going to nickel and diamonds\nand we have to buy your thing. It's like, no. What\nyou do in the game, you own, if you buy something,\nyou own that asset. If you buy a skin right now in\nanother game in Fortnite, whatever.\n00:12:14.950 - 00:12:26.006, Speaker A: What do you\ndo when you don't want the skin anymore? When you get\nyour money back from epic? Go ask them. They're not\ngoing to give you your money back. You played it for\na month, that's yours. You bought it with us. You're\ntired of that skin. Sell it. You don't have to hang\non to it.\n00:12:26.006 - 00:12:39.710, Speaker A: Maybe you'll\nmake money. Maybe it goes up. Or if you don't want to\nbuy anything, that's fine. Just play the game. Earn\nresources, that resource collection mechanism in the\ngame. Eventually, when you get enough, you can\nactually craft an NFT in the game. That NFT is going\nto have value.\n00:12:39.710 - 00:13:08.710, Speaker A: You can\nconvert it to dollars if you want, you can convert to\nbitcoin. That's a real asset that you own. So it's a\nlittle bit like, I think about it like imagine if\nthis was like 5000 years ago and we're all living on\nland, right? And we're just like, we have tents or\nwhatever and we're just like hanging out living on\nland. And that's one level of wealth.

If it wasn't for the fact that I\nhave title to my house, I couldn't have done that and\nI never would have made the game. But unlocking that\nland ownership is what unlocks those economies, some\nthird world economies. The problem that they have is\nthat people don't have title to their land. They live\non a plot of land. They've lived there for decades,\ntheir family, it could be second, 3rd generation, but\nthe legal system is such a mess.\n00:13:28.958 - 00:13:42.978, Speaker A: You don't\nactually own title to your land. That means you can't\ngo to a bank and get a loan. I mean, you're\nrestricted. So what's happening now with NFTs and\nthis whole economy is all of a sudden digital assets.\nYou own it, you have ownership of it. That just\nunlocks a whole new economy. And that's what we're\nseeing.\n00:13:42.978 - 00:14:00.130, Speaker A: But it's\nscary initially, and a lot of people still don't get\nit. They think, oh, it's like a scam or, yeah, it's\njust like another microtransaction. It's not.

So if you want to take a loan\nout and use your NFT as collateral, you can do that.\nIf you want to do yield farming with an NFT, you'll\nbe able to do that as well.

People are always,\nevery time there's like a new. When the industrial\nrevolution came along, the people are like, oh, but\nall these jobs are going to be wiped away. These\nmanual jobs we had before, now they're mechanized.\nYeah, but like 1000 new careers sprung up that we\ndidn't have before. This is the same process that\nwe're seeing now. It's just the beginning of it.\n00:14:50.390 - 00:15:17.300, Speaker A: But earning\nmoney in a metaverse is going to be a real job very\nsoon, and it's going to replace jobs that are\ndisappearing like truck drivers. I'm sorry, it sucks,\nbut that's going away. There's nothing we can do\nabout that. But what we can do is create new\nopportunities where it's like, okay, if all trucks\nare automated and all cars are automated, and there's\nno more taxi drivers and truck drivers, there's going\nto be a metaverse and many metaverses, and you can\nactually earn a living there.

My corollary is back when I\nplayed Runescape as a young kid, and you would like\nmine, or that you can sell in the marketplace and if\nyou held it enough, you can go on kind of like the\nPayPal black markets and flip it that way. Now it's\njust like the platform is already there, but we're\nreally early. This sounds like we're on the third\ndomino and we're just getting started and we don't\nreally even have the primitives to really understand\nhow big this could be.\n00:15:45.504 - 00:16:07.178, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it\nis.

And it's just maybe\nthe more productive games are more boring.

I think\nthe most important book that I think has ever been\nwritten is Plotinus, the greek philosopher. Yeah, he\nwrote a book called the Aeneids. It's the most\ndifficult thing I've ever read in my life by know,\nscientific stuff is really like if you're reading\nabout biology or computers and how software works or\nthis and the other, but it's still like in a paradigm\nthat you can understand, which basically it's cause\nand effect and somewhat you can understand the\nrelationships that kind of like metaphysics that\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "982153dd-4b25-42cf-b95f-fafc3f4c2b45": {"__data__": {"id_": "982153dd-4b25-42cf-b95f-fafc3f4c2b45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 21, "source": "17", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "Top-Tier Gaming comes to Bitcoin via Stacks - Founder of Moonray - Rodrigo Etcheto Interview", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N9MXPkyo_8", "release_date": "2021-10-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "plotinus wrote.

They were anything but.\n00:25:24.482 - 00:25:28.200, Speaker A: They were, in\na lot of ways, much, much smarter and more advanced\nthan we are.\n00:25:28.650 - 00:26:01.646, Speaker B: Okay. It's\nvery interesting. Yeah. There's an idea that popped\nup when I was looking at the backstory of moonray,\nand it made me think of the Tower of Babel story\nwhere you have this Miam, which gives you godlike\npowers in a sense. And then the main God creates\npretty much everything that's in existence. And then\none of the worlds starts to kind of like flourish,\nand they become aware of Miam and they start to\nworship it themselves, and they want to become like\ngods. And so that's the Tower of Babel being built.\n00:26:01.646 - 00:26:28.546, Speaker B: But the\ndifference in your game is that God can't crush the\ntower and spread across all the languages. The God\nthat has the power is still bounded by something. And\nso when it goes to the planet, she becomes imprisoned\nand has to find a different way out to then break\ndown the cult that's imprisoning her. That idea is\nsuper fascinating.\n00:26:28.658 - 00:27:07.542, Speaker A: Yeah, it's\nlike at some point, power becomes almost more like\nanyone can get hold of it. And even though you got\nfar ahead, at some point, like the goddess in this\ncase, she got really far ahead, then she stopped\npaying attention. This other group, this planet,\nforms a cult around it, and all of a sudden, it's\nlike now she can't control it either. And I kind of\nlike that there's no ultimate, any one being or thing\nthat can crush anyone. It's like everyone has to\nfight always.

We're going to\nstart working real soon on a comic book series that\nwe're going to be releasing first before the game\ncomes out, and then alongside it to really develop\nsome of the storylines. Like in a comic book. I like\nbooks, and then I really like comic books, too,\nbecause the cool thing about comics is I think it's\nlike one of the most creative genres that exists now\nbecause you get the visual element in a comic book\nwhere you can really kind of paint a picture of a\nwhole world.

Last question. And I want to treat this question\nkind of like an aspirational but also maybe a time\ncapsule. So if you guys take off and crush it, this\nwould be like the piece we look back on and go, look,\nfive years ago he said that shit, and it's all came\ntrue.

You guys have been\ndropping some mysterious ish alpha on Twitter. Not\ndiluting everything, but dropping some alpha about\nwhat you guys have been building. Looks like you\nmight have solved some very big problems around roll\nups.

So I'm also like CEO of JVA Labs, but\nI'm an engineer crownsperson. So I worked as\ndeveloper for years. Initially I did developments on\nsome EVM chains. I was smart contract developer. Then\nin the meanwhile I was playing around with Utxos and\nbuilding some mock blockchains with Utxos. Then after\nsome point I got interested more in bitcoin.\n00:01:20.530 - 00:02:14.310, Speaker B: And early\nthis year actually as a company, we built ordinal\nsafe, one of the first extension wallets on ordinals.\nAnd it was quite fantastic for us because we launched\na product in a month and it got lots of users and\nordinance was really hype and it was exciting process\nfor us and we dig deeper on tap route and scripts. So\nin a quick time we got really expertise on the tap\nroot side. And after that point we also previously\ndeveloped zero knowledge proof systems on EVM chain.\nFor example, we developed proof of innocence, which\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "df3d232b-14c2-40f9-ad30-259d65eec81f": {"__data__": {"id_": "df3d232b-14c2-40f9-ad30-259d65eec81f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 25, "source": "2", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "BitVM meets ZK Rollups on Bitcoin with Orkun Kilic - Co-Founder of Citrea", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeYTYgt7_SE", "release_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "is a privacy tool on EVM chains.

And\non that topic, could you place us, when were you\nbuilding on ETH and then when did you start to\ntransition over? Because it's a trend I've seen some\npeople do. They kind of either left 2017 or they left\nlast bull run and jumped over. So I'm curious, can\nyou place us.\n00:02:33.972 - 00:03:20.890, Speaker B: Time wise as\na regular job? I think we were on EVM ecosystem in\ngeneral until two years ago, eth ecosystem much more.\nBut we were also interested in Utxo side, especially\nplaying around Utxo's building interesting scripts\nand pets. And meanwhile, like I said, we discovered,\nokay, we were talking about modularity roll ups, and\nwe talked about, okay, there's a Utxo based system.\nThere is no account, no contract once. It's like we\ncan embed data, embed the roll up data for this. We\nalready know, like colored coins and RGB and stuff,\nbut we want to do something more expressible. We\nstarted with that idea.\n00:03:20.890 - 00:03:44.900, Speaker B: Then Casey\ninvented ordinance, basically. So in scriptures, we\nknew that it was already possible, but we haven't\nexplored any path before Ord actually came out. And\nafter the ordinance came out, we realized, okay,\nthere's an easy way to do it, and we can use this for\ndefiant stuff. After building ordinance safe, we\nimmediately focused on this, left the research part\nand actually started building.\n00:03:45.750 - 00:03:48.546, Speaker A: Got it\nperfect.\n00:03:48.648 - 00:03:48.914, Speaker B: Then.\n00:03:48.952 - 00:04:48.854, Speaker A: I think\nthat's a pretty good segue to start to jump into roll\nups broadly, because this is a topic that in Eth, you\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "44d27471-5c7f-4904-9388-8d94e206df7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "44d27471-5c7f-4904-9388-8d94e206df7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 25, "source": "3", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "BitVM meets ZK Rollups on Bitcoin with Orkun Kilic - Co-Founder of Citrea", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeYTYgt7_SE", "release_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "guys are much further ahead.

Roll up\nis actually. I prefer to call them execution shots\nbecause eventually roll ups are the only trustless\nconstruction of l twos in a universal manner. So we\nhave, like, lightning, and it is a peer to peer. So\nthat it is trustless. You are only trusting yourself.\nBut in universal systems that has global states, for\nexample, that is mostly programmable chains, like\nthink about liquid, think about stakes, think about\nrootstock.\n00:05:21.566 - 00:06:02.886, Speaker B: These are\nuniversal systems, and these systems is not\ntrustless. You are moving away from bitcoin, trusting\nanother entity, like stake miners, rootstop signers,\nor merge miners and stuff. These are not trustless\nsolutions but roll ups. In I think 2018 they emerged\nas the trustless and universal solutions and it\nactually stems from one single and most important\nthing. They use bitcoin block space. They don't\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "b785f7c0-8389-49e7-877a-24019efca563": {"__data__": {"id_": "b785f7c0-8389-49e7-877a-24019efca563", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 25, "source": "4", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "BitVM meets ZK Rollups on Bitcoin with Orkun Kilic - Co-Founder of Citrea", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeYTYgt7_SE", "release_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "create another block space or they are not moving to\noff chain and do some things there.

And they embed the\ndata on chain so that you can unilaterally exit and\nuse this data to construct the state. Basically roll\nups are like only trustless universal tools that can\nbe built and on bitcoin context. So far we couldn't\naware of any construction that can be trustless to\nbuild on bitcoin. There are sovereign roll ups like\nyou said. They are basically using bitcoin to embed\nsome data and depend on client side validation. Just\nlike RGB and other client side validated protocols\nlike an ordinance also.\n00:06:41.660 - 00:07:02.610, Speaker B: But this\nfalls short in something they don't have breach.\nNative breach to peg in and peg out. BTC sovereign\nrollups don't have breach. They are just using\nbitcoin as DA and consensus. Bitcoin doesn't aware of\nanything happens on the roll up. So you cannot peg\nin, peg out trustlessly or trust minimize. These were\nthe problems.\n00:07:02.610 - 00:07:52.366, Speaker B: And initially\nonce we started citre we were building a sovereign\nroll up and thinking about solving the peg problem in\nsome other way, which is now abundant but later. 2023\nRobin invented BTM. I think this is like most\nimportant thing in bitcoin space right now for maybe\ntwo or three years, because it basically allows us to\nbuild smart contracts in a trust minimized way. I\njust saw your tweet, like you hate the word trust\nminimize, but it is not trustless because not every\nparticipant, not every bitcoin node verifies the\nscripts. But if something happens, they are verifying\nit. So it is not a client side validation or it is\nnot not native. It is validated inside the bitcoin.\n00:07:52.366 - 00:08:44.610, Speaker B: If something\ngoes wrong, this is an efficiency problem.

If we need to\ngo further, we need to introduce several opcodes to\nmake them fully trustless, which we can still talk\nabout at the end of the recording. But currently BPM\nprovides us a trust minimized way to build these roll\nups on bitcoin.\n00:08:45.270 - 00:09:31.570, Speaker A: Got it. Okay,\nwe covered a lot that I'm going to try and rehash a\nlittle bit of it to make sure that we're going in\nkind of eyes wide open. So one thing you said is that\nroll ups, ideally they give you a trustless\nenvironment and they batch things. You mentioned this\nword execution shards. And I think this is something\nthat most people that aren't super technical don't\nfully grasp. Myself included around. What does\nexecution mean when it comes to global state and\nblockchains versus storing state of data availability\nor what is true? So I just want to make sure when it\ncomes to this execution shard piece that you\nmentioned, is that really important to understand\nwhat a roll up is? And if so, can you just double\nclick on a little further to make sure that we rock\nit properly?\n00:09:32.310 - 00:10:03.280, Speaker B: Maybe I can\ngive some examples on bitcoin network and ordinals.\nSo in bitcoin regular payment transactions, both\nsettle on bitcoin, right? All the nodes agree on the\nsame state, so they settle on bitcoin. And all the\ndata is published on bitcoin network. So all the\nnodes have the same transactional data. So this is\nalso data availability itself on the l one.

Their script\nstarts with op, false, right? It says that don't\nexecute this branch. So the data embedded with or not\ndon't get executed on bitcoin because they are not\nprograms or scripts, they are just bunch of data. So\nin bitcoin core node, these data is only used for\ndata availability, but the execution happens off\nchain. You are running an orgnode, which is basically\na meta protocol that looks to bitcoin, extracts the\ndata from bitcoin and make it meaningful like\nconcentrates all the bytes and says okay, this is\nthis gPEG, this is this HTML. It settles on its node\nand also it executes these things, for example,\nrecursive inscriptions.\n00:10:55.594 - 00:11:15.566, Speaker B: It\nrecursively executes the scripts off chain. The\nrecursion is not happening on chain. Only data is put\non chain. This is like something unique to\nmetaprotocals. They both settle and execute off\nchain. But the data is held in bitcoin in roll ups.\nThis is also pretty similar in native rollups.\n00:11:15.566 - 00:11:47.962, Speaker B: I'm talking\nabout an optimistic roll ups. We are using bitcoin as\ndata availability layer, which means all the data\nsits on bitcoin network and settlement also happens\non bitcoin network. Right now it is true bitvm. And\nin the future it can be like ops EKP or Ops Stark.\nAny other opcode that can settle the transaction so\nall nodes can be aware of. But execution happens\nafter bitcoin doesn't know about these transactions.\nFor example, we are building a Zkem, which is the\nEthereum virtual machine implementation running on\nbitcoin.\n00:11:47.962 - 00:12:30.170, Speaker B: But bitcoin\ndoesn't actually run atarium virtual machine.

Okay.\nAnd then just to make sure I kind of understand this,\none of the differences with a regular l two side\nchain is that once you peg out, Bitcoin has no idea\nwhat's going on there. And the data availability is\nalso on that side chain. So it's like a fully\nenclosed system versus roll ups that kind of have\nthis synergy between the base layer and the roll up,\nright?\n00:12:55.110 - 00:13:29.774, Speaker B: Yes. So side\nchains, like I said once, imagine that you are moving\nto a side chain. You usually use some kind of pegging\nprocess, like multisig, right? You are depositing\nyour BTC to some multisig. Then you go to a side\nchain and imagine that this side chain is merged\nmines. So in this side chain, if miners and majority\nof nodes are like dishonest, they can steal your\nmoney. And if the bridge nodes, bridge signers are\ndishonest, they can steal your money. Or they can\njust withhold the data from you, just block your IP\naddress so that you cannot access the data.\n00:13:29.774 - 00:13:52.354, Speaker B: You cannot\nget the data anywhere. So that you cannot even\nrequest an exit. Even though you request an exit,\nthey can just prevent you from exit. This is the\nunsecure things about sidechain. But in the roll up\ncase, all the data is also on the bitcoin network.\nAnd bitcoin is censorship. Just create a bitcoin core\nnode.\n00:13:52.354 - 00:14:17.690, Speaker B: Then you have\nall the roll up data so that you can use this to exit\nunitarily in the BitVM. Not unitarily.

So the biggest issue here really is\nthe assurances you have really getting your bitcoin\nback off that side chain. Because for the most part,\nwe've had proof of burn forever, where you can just\nsend your coins one way, do a bunch of fancy stuff,\nand it's kind of stuck.

Why we are using this term\nenhances the capabilities of bitcoin block space,\nbecause citre is not some off chain solution like\nside chain. Citre actually works on bitcoin block\nspace and process lots of transactions, maybe like\nten times even higher than bitcoin, or 100 times\nhigher than bitcoin, and batch them together and\nsubmits them to the bitcoin blockchain again.

Then we\njust leave these things behind and create a new\necosystem that has own security guarantees. We don't\nwant that. So we are expanding the capabilities of\nbitcoin block space.

Let's give an example from\nrootstock, because it's a perfect example to have an\nunderstanding on that. You are taking risk of two\nthings in rootstock, right? One is the nine signers\non the bitcoin main chain that held all the bitcoin\nin a multi stick. This is the one security\nassumption, and the other security assumption is\nrootstock network is actually secure. They have\nenough hash power, they have enough honest nodes that\ncan put your money secure, and there is no reorgs\nthrough miners and stuff. You are getting two\nsecurity assumptions on that.\n00:20:41.290 - 00:21:28.150, Speaker B: On ZK roll\nups, the block producing and node part is trusted\nthanks to ZK proofs. All these block producing\nprocess and transaction process creates a validity\nproof assertive. The correctness of the process, so\nthat you don't need to trust anyone, any node, any\nblock producer. You just get a mathematical proof and\nyou are verifying it so that this is correct. On that\nside you are not taking any trust assumption, but on\nbreach side you are taking assumption of BTVN, which\nis one of them. We call it uns minority assumption.\nFor example, in regular multisig, for example in nine\nsigner, if you have five malicious signer, they can\nsteal the money, right? It is five of nine actually.\n00:21:28.150 - 00:22:19.110, Speaker B: But if you\nhave nine verifiers in ViTV, the money can only get\nstolen if nine of them are dishonest. Also, this is\nsomething like much more secure than five of nine.\nBecause if at least one of these persons are honest,\nthen the money is secure.

Okay,\nnow that makes sense. Yeah. And on the ZK proof side,\nI just want to make sure that everyone understands.\nAnd I think I get it, which is that what you mean by\nZK proof is that you have. So we know about\ncryptography, which is like this very advanced but\nverifiable mathematics, that when you put it through\nthese algorithms or these hashing functions that you\nget, depending, if the input is the same, the output\nis the same, and then you can verify this equals\nthis.

And the honest minority is\nthat as long as you have that one proof, you can\nchallenge all the dishonest actors and it runs\nthrough that tree of mathematics, cryptography and\ngets to, no, you ten people are wrong, because I have\nthis proof here that's mathematical. Is that like a\nlayman's way of putting it?\n00:23:34.148 - 00:24:11.498, Speaker B: Yes,\ndefinitely. Like you can see the k proofs as a black\nbox and vast setup in gold roll up, we are agreeing\non that. Okay, this is a black box and the label of\nit is a. So if you just verify the proof using this a\nlabel, that you will get true or false if the proof\nis correctly. Like get all these black box circuits\ninside of the black box that you will get true. If it\nmisses any of the branches on circuit, or just going\naround the black box and producing a fake proof, then\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "e2467095-51cb-4991-b62a-d706584efd8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2467095-51cb-4991-b62a-d706584efd8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 25, "source": "13", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "BitVM meets ZK Rollups on Bitcoin with Orkun Kilic - Co-Founder of Citrea", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeYTYgt7_SE", "release_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "the function has to return false.

And if all the verifiers can agree by\njust verifying the proof against the label, that they\npreviously agreed on, then everything is good. And if\none of them thinks that okay, operator provides me a\nfalse proof which returns false in my function, then\nthey can provide the correct proof and slash the\noperator and replace the operator so that they can\nhelp users to exit the system. This is how well this\nis the proof works in collaboration with PTVR.\n00:24:56.830 - 00:25:50.090, Speaker A: Got it. That\nmakes sense. So, on the side of who's verifying\nthese, it seems like up to this point, most of it has\nbeen economic based incentives to make these things\nwork. So you have miners who have an incentive to get\nthe fee structure where you have stacks, which is\nalso like a similar, they get a token signers lock up\ntheir thing. So most of them have been economic\nincentives, and that's who you're putting your trust\nin when it comes to. If we're going to identify who\nare the verifiers here, and again, honest minority,\nlike, as long as you have one honest person, you're\ngood. But I guess the first question is, how do you\nbecome a verifier? What does this process look like?\nCan we each do it ourselves? Are you staking\nanything? Help me understand, how are individuals\nsecuring this and becoming verifiers?\n00:25:51.230 - 00:26:40.038, Speaker B: In the\ncurrent BTVM construction, the verifier set is\nstatic, which means that you cannot just go to the\nset and edit the set at any time. It is set one time\nand continue the lifetime for the roll up. And they\nstate some BTC in the BTM program, so that if they\nchallenge something wrong, they get the BTC of\noperator.

Because if it goes down, then this is crypto\neconomically not secure.\n00:26:40.038 - 00:27:21.434, Speaker B: But in VM,\nthe staking amount is not a function of the bridge\namount. It is some static amount that you need to\nstake, because everything is cryptographically\nasserted. You don't need to put high collaterals. If\nyou just wrong, your stake is gone. No matter what is\nthe bridge amount. Your wrongness or correctness can\nbe proved in the BCM, so that in the beginning it's a\nfixed set of verifiers that are like minimal crypto\neconomic buzer, because it doesn't depend on crypto\neconomic security, but it depends on cryptographic\nsecurity.

That's\nsuper interesting. Okay, so as you mentioned, when\nit's pure economics, you have to have the TVL and the\nlocked economic security are kind of intention. And\nthis could be like a hash rate majority if it's merge\nmining or this could be, I think with the new SBTC\nmodel, it's something like 70%, which is a lot, but\nstill it's based on economics.

You absolve\nyourself of your BTC, which is like your collateral.\nAnd do you get kicked out from the verifiers at that\npoint? And again, like you say, it's static.

And\non smart assumption. So if you need to change the\nset, if verifiers can agree, they can immediately\nchange the set and set up an EBCM program if\neverything has a good intention. So you know that. So\nyou can just sign the transaction and make a new\ncommittee.

Help me understand that nuance there.\n00:30:42.192 - 00:31:15.634, Speaker B: Yeah.\nSettlements, like the actual verification on BiTVM\nhappens in every six months, but this doesn't mean\nthat withdrawals are happening in every six months.\nIf everything is good, mean everything is optimistic.\nThe operator already front covers the liquidity for\nwithdrawals. Then after six months, it claims all the\nfront covered liquidity from the BitVM program, so\nthat withdrawals are immediate once the proof is\nfinalized on bitcoin. But the claim process by\noperator happens later. As HCM is one of not\ntrustless.\n00:31:15.634 - 00:31:45.982, Speaker B: You always\nneed some party to collaborate. You cannot\nunilaterally exit without OPZKP, some kind of opcode.\nThis is why you need to front cover. If operator\nrejects the front cover, these transactions at the\nend of six months, they got kicked out from the\ncommittee, and the honest verifier replaces the\noperator, so it can help you to exit by front\ncovering. Your liquidity claim. The money six months\nafter that. So six months is the actual settlement\ntime.\n00:31:45.982 - 00:32:07.640, Speaker B: This is\nbecause of the inefficiency of BTM. You cannot just\nsettle in every single block because it takes too\nlong. If there's a fraud proof and you are moving all\nthe Utxos, it also costs lots of money on BTC.

It sounds like a really deadly combo to\nsolve a really big pain point. So really excited\nabout that. So we've seen a few people recently try\nand raise on ZK roll up tech, and they have a token.\n00:34:40.630 - 00:35:00.074, Speaker A: So they're\nraising on that token. It's a gas token. Who you\nstake it? Who knows? They do fancy stuff. Do you guys\nhave a token? And who gets fees on the roll up? I'm\nassuming it's not BTC, but yeah. Is there a token?\nAnd how does that dance down?\n00:35:00.272 - 00:35:20.370, Speaker B: We don't have\na token. The BTC is our native token. It is just\nrenamed as like CBTC, Citra, BTC to make the process\neasier. But we don't have any citra token or sites\nlike there will be lots of scams and hopefully not.\nBut there is no chair token.

So basically fees go to bitcoin\nminers. This is the whole point of using bitcoin\nblock space. So we are collecting fees on the roll up\non citre. Then we are paying like 99 of percent of\nthe fees to bitcoin miners because we are inscribing\na bunch of data to bitcoin network. And also this\nincludes VK proof, some compressed transaction data,\nsome other transaction metadata that we need to put.\nWe are putting all of them to a bitcoin block.\n00:35:55.594 - 00:36:49.726, Speaker B: So we are\npaying lots of fees to bitcoin miners.

This is why CTRA also contributes\nbitcoin's long term health by just paying lots of\nfees to miners and increasing the hash rate and\nincreasing the security and so on. And on the fee\nside, like I said, most of the fees obviously go to\nbitcoin miners because we have to describe the\ntransaction data and we have to pay for that.\n00:36:49.726 - 00:37:25.050, Speaker B: And the rest\nof the transaction data will go to proverbs which\nproduces ZK proof. And it is not an easy job. We are\nrunning really huge machines and this goes to that.\nAnd at some point the sequence around prover will get\nmulti. So we will have lots of sequencers that work\nin coordination and we will have prover which is a\npermissionless that anyone can produce a proof.

And for example\nwe can port a webassemble vm into the stack and every\nrust developer in the world start and developer\nbitcoin application.\n00:41:19.320 - 00:41:28.398, Speaker B: This is a\nfuture plan, not something prioritized first. But\nthis definitely enables lots of builders to build on\nbitcoin.\n00:41:28.594 - 00:42:02.660, Speaker A: Got it. Very\nexciting. I'm curious, a lot of my audience is\nsomewhat newer. Some of them want to become\ndevelopers. I'm curious, in your experience, we're in\nearly 2024 and you have things like evm roll ups\ncoming online. What would you recommend people do\nright now? Does it help to really learn bitcoin\nscript? If these expansive l two s are coming, would\nyou learn solidity? Like any general advice I'd be\ncurious about?\n00:42:03.430 - 00:43:04.722, Speaker B: I would say\nlike right now, bitcoin script has some apps that\nalso like user facing the multistore solutions like\nMidVM, but most of the applications will be on l two\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "568ccbdb-b030-441e-93f1-b6ab40f40057": {"__data__": {"id_": "568ccbdb-b030-441e-93f1-b6ab40f40057", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 25, "source": "22", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "BitVM meets ZK Rollups on Bitcoin with Orkun Kilic - Co-Founder of Citrea", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeYTYgt7_SE", "release_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "mainly. So if you want to develop some, let's say\nuser facing application, then going with solidity and\ndeploying on j is the best way that you can do. But\nfor example, if you want to work with bitcoin script\nbitm, you want to do an infrastructure layer for the\ntools and the other applications. Then bitcoin script\nis also a good way. I don't want to pull everyone to\nsolidity. Then I want lots of bitcoin script\ndevelopers, and I also need good script developers to\nwork side by side. But if you want to have some user\nfacing application come build on Citrix because there\nwill be lots of liquidity, there will be lots of\ndeveloper support so that you can deploy your\napplications easily and start welcoming users.\n00:43:04.722 - 00:43:25.760, Speaker B: But if you\nwant to build some infrastructure, then I think\nbitcoin script also if you want build something\nnatively on bitcoin. For example, they did some\ntricks with Opcat, the pepper wizards. They did some\ncool scripts like covenants and stuff if you'd like\nit. I fully support learning bitcoin scripts, but\nmost of the user facing things will happen also.\n00:43:26.610 - 00:43:41.890, Speaker A: Perfect\nanswer. And ultimately we need 100 x more developers\nacross the board on everything bitcoin because\nthere's just so much to build. So cool. I appreciate\nthat. Well this has been great. We covered an\nabsolute ton. Super excited.\n00:43:41.890 - 00:44:04.940, Speaker A: Just the idea\nof minimal collateral and this cryptography for the\npeg and verifier process seems like such a big\nunlock, so they're excited to see that out in the\nwild I guess. Last two questions. First one, when can\nwe use this? When is this going to launch? Where's\nthe product at currently?\n00:44:05.630 - 00:45:00.540, Speaker B: Yeah, so we\nare recording this pre launch, but hopefully in the\nFebruary we launch the technical specs so that you\ncan learn all the internals of citre, how it works\nand stuff. And you can also start learning solidity,\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "dcb73256-cdeb-430e-9dcc-2f11cf53296b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcb73256-cdeb-430e-9dcc-2f11cf53296b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"total_pages": 25, "source": "23", "document_type": "youtube_video", "title": "BitVM meets ZK Rollups on Bitcoin with Orkun Kilic - Co-Founder of Citrea", "channel_name": "Built on Bitcoin", "video_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeYTYgt7_SE", "release_date": "2024-02-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "start developing applications and hopefully in the\napp build we will have a public testnet so you can\ndeploy your applications.

So in the Apple\nwe will have a public test that people can deploy,\npeople can use, but right now you can just join the\ncommunity. We will have a big discord that people\ntalk and ask questions. We will have a developer\ntalkhouse and we will have a documentation section\nthat you can visit anytime and gain up to date\ninformation about J awesome.\n00:45:01.150 - 00:45:15.620, Speaker A: Sounds good.\nAnd I'll have all those links down below as well. I\nguess last question is, is there anything that I\ndidn't ask? Any closing thoughts or things you want\nto cover that we didn't cover so far?\n00:45:16.550 - 00:46:28.360, Speaker B: I think on\nthe technical side and user flow side we covered a\nlot of things, but I need to say that we are building\nCitrix bitcoin equivalent secure and true, incomplete\nand easy developer UX infrastructure for everyone to\nbuild on bitcoin and use bitcoin with this EVM base.\nWith bitcoin security, you can build privacy out\ntrees, you can do private bitcoin swaps, you can do\nprivate sense, you can even put a better version of\nLightning on Citrea and it will work flawlessly\nrather than dealing all with on chain stuff on\nlightning you are just putting on CJ. It has trust\nminimized BTC naturally coming from Citra and you are\nusing it on your parent solution. I think the future\nwill be on building on citre building on bitcoin\nequivalent secure and true complete layer that can\nprovide all the things that you need. And if you have\nsome applications or want to deploy fully open and my\ndms are open and you can reach out to me for every\nchannel. We have a big developer team, we have a big\nbusiness development team. We can always support you.\n00:46:29.550 - 00:46:33.900, Speaker A: Awesome.
